{"id": "dv3sld", "title": "A brief history of WallStreetBets (for all of you who joined during the era of infinite money and have no idea what this sub was originally for or how we got to here)", "selftext": "The sub is 7 years old, and I've been here (on my main account) since basically the beginning. Back in the day, people used to discuss the gambling-ish stock trades they were making. At the beginning it was all about users throwing their life savings into penny stocks, losing it all, and then posting about their losses for that sweet sweet karma. There was a Bitcoin frenzy for a little while, and then the sub discovered options, where the *real* gambling could happen. (If you know nothing about options: when used the way most /r/wsb users use them, they're essentially all-or-nothing bets on the direction a stock will go. You usually lose everything you bet, but sometimes you make 10x your money. It's essentially playing roulette, except the house you're playing against is not just a dinky casino but the entire god damn financial system. Suffice it to say it's a tough bet to win big on. Of course I'm simplifying, but honestly that's as good of an understanding as 95% of the users here have about options anyway.)\n\n\nUsers like /u/fscomeau started getting infamous for gambling huge amounts on ridiculously bad takes (like that Apple stock was going to crash), and they usually lost it all and posted about it for the memes. Every now and again (it was rare, but it happened), someone would make tens of thousands of dollars on a single trade, get upvoted heavily, and spur dozens of other idiots to gamble their money trying to do the same thing. Those people would bet thousands on dumb stocks, lose it all, and post about it. Rinse, repeat. It'd be impossible for me to list all the people who lost tons of money based on the bad advice they got in that sub, but there's a [Hall of Fame](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dsaet3/hall_of_autists/) (or Shame, probably) growing that you can peruse to get some more color.\n\n\nNow, as tremendously dumb as that is, it's pretty understandable. Maybe expected, even. People with no regard for their own money gamble it away every day. It's dumb, but it's a relatively harmless and contained dumb, you know?\n\n\nThen, in 2015, the sub blew up and made like a thousand people mods, and the entire culture began its long shift to pure memery. There was still a facade of it being all about real trading, but by a few years later, the days of anything even vaguely resembling actual trading advice are long gone. And, don't get me wrong, people really DID used to treat it seriously and at least act as though they were discussing advanced trading strategies and shit. A post from 2015 that was randomly re-posted here a few days ago turned up comments like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3odxi6/wsb_pleb_crisis_2015/cvwho8t/) that make my point clear \u2014\u00a0it really was SUPPOSED to be a place for gambling-minded traders to argue about the best way to potentially 10x their capital. (Minor aside: the sub also got majorly into Martin Shkreli around that time, and followed his live-streamed trading philosophy religiously, especially in between when he was sentenced and when he actually started serving his jail sentence. If you saw people defending him on Reddit at that time, it was probably some WSBer. Or me. Whoops.) The point I just really want to stress that the sub was actually intended to, and sort of used to be, a trading sub that was bad at it (that also had an occasional meme), and NOT a meme sub that was good at it (and also had an occasional trade).\n\n\nRobinhood's launch was the real catalyst that sent us headlong down the path to where we are today. Commission-free trades and no account minimums meant that literally any idiot with a hundred bucks could bet on options like the big boys. Stories of complete losses kept pouring in, propped up forever by the occasional tales of massive gains. It was fun to watch. Just like before, it was dumb in a way you could still pretty easily wrap your head around.\n\n\nThis year, though, shit started hitting the fan (mainly for Robinhood, but also for any hope you may have had for humanity) when /u/1ronyman used something called a box spread to get himself $58k in debt, despite having only deposited $5k in the first place, before his account got shut down. Somehow he actually managed to withdraw $10k before that happened, so he actually profited on the whole situation. He's the original chief idiot of 2019, but he's also something of a legend to us old-timers. Robinhood completely banned box spreads on the platform due to him.\n\n\nThat all brings us to the last couple weeks. First, /u/controlthenarrative found, exploited, and reported on ANOTHER issue with Robinhood's platform, once again to the tune of around $50k. Essentially, he got RH to accidentally loan him tens of thousands of dollars on around $2k of collateral. He followed in the footsteps of /u/1ronyman and ALSO bet on Apple crashing. Once again, it did not do that. The trade blew up in his face, we all laughed about it, but ultimately everyone realized it was a serious matter, so by the time Robinhood promptly patched the bug everyone had learned a good lesson about risk.\n\n\nJust kidding! Robinhood did NOTHING, everyone learned NOTHING, and /u/woodc93 used the same exploit to open a $350k position on a $5,000 deposit! Imagine going to buy a $350k house, giving the bank $5k as a downpayment without even so much as showing them your credit score, and walking out the door like all was well with the world. Well, /u/woodc93 did exactly that. And, wouldn't you know it, he ALSO BET ON APPLE CRASHING, WHICH IS NOT A GOOD BET, I MEAN SERIOUSLY BET ON ANYTHING ELSE OH MY GOD ARE YOU JOKING. Apple again did not crash, so he lost it all and got himself way in debt. Now, FINALLY, Robinhood realized their enormous (and illegal) mistake, tucked their tail between their legs, fixed the issue, and reprimanded everyone involved.\n\n\nJUST KIDDING!! Robinhood did NOTHING! So /u/MoonYachts took that as an invitation to attempt to get Robinhood to loan him ONE MILLION DOLLARS on a $4,000 deposit. Obviously this would never work at any brokerage firm. Except of course it did work because it's just a million dollars and what's the worst thing that can happen \u00af\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af. To his credit, he must have decided that betting on Apple's demise like his forefathers before him was a poor idea, so he instead invested it all in Ford stock. Of all things. Whatever. Regardless, I don't even know if anyone here knows what the result of that one was, but it is exceedingly likely that he, too, will wind up  dramatically in debt with nothing but a metric shitload of Reddit Gold to show for it. But at LEAST this time we'd finally hit the real limit, a legit million dollars, and Robinhood finally wised up and fixed the problem.\n\n\nJUST FUCKING KIDDING DID YOU SERIOUSLY BELIEVE ME THAT TIME\u203d LITERALLY A FEW HOURS LATER /u/call_warrior SET A NEW \"RECORD\" BY BORROWING OVER $1.7 MILLION ON A $4,000 DEPOSIT. I don't even have enough sarcasm for this anymore. At the rate we're going now, Robinhood is going to be hundreds of thousands of dollars (at least) in debt, there's going to be an SEC investigation, the entire platform could get shut down, and pigs may actually start flying. There's literally no way to even guess what's going to happen next in this sub, honestly, because every step that has been taken so far has been a whole order of magnitude dumber than the last.\n\n\nWhen you take a step back, it's an incredible environment, remarkable that it even exists. It's a group of monkeys at a Bloomberg terminal with an enormous crowd of bystanders egging them on to throw even more of their shit at the keyboard. The whole situation really shows you just how dangerous a clever idiot can be, especially when that idiot has a $7B+ company seemingly egging them on to do something crazier than perhaps anyone in the history of finance has been able to do on only a few thousand dollars of their own capital. The history lesson is the important backdrop that, in my opinion, is a microcosm of our society as a whole: 5 years ago, people would lose $5k of their own money and get at least somewhat sad about it, but now people are INTENTIONALLY blowing that $5k of their own money in order to take out illicit loans from Robinhood for LITERALLY OVER A MILLION DOLLARS, knowing full well they're almost certain to get themselves deeply in debt, risking a serious SEC investigation, and even expecting bankruptcy, ALL FOR THE MEMES. To say the stupidity is brazen is an understatement. Honestly, it's beautiful, and I'm just glad I've been along for the ride. Godspeed, and I'll see you when someone finds a way to lose $10M in a weekend.", "created_utc": 1573527411, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dv3sld/a_brief_history_of_wallstreetbets_for_all_of_you/", "is_self": true}
