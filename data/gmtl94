I spoke with another user here last week regarding people making dumb ass mistakes during earnings last quarter. I forgot what the common mistake was, but I took advantage both selling and buying calls on a stock that was very similar to whatever the actual pump was. \n\nHP Enterprise should be benefitting as well from the remote workforce. Green lake is an everything as a service with a pay as you go, non contract usage. Easy to use cloud/edge technology.\n\nIn all seriousness though, I bought this to follow the retards making mistakes. Earnings 5/21 \n\n\n$10 and 10.5 calls, maybe 11 depending on how HPQ keeps moving. \n\nPure retardation", "created_utc": 1589910948.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gmtl94/for_those_missing_out_on_hpq_hpe/", "is_self": true}
