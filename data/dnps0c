What a true autist. Anyways I wasn't sure if I wanted to finish this let alone release it but I wasn't going to let two adderalls and an all-nighter go to waste. SO here we are. \n\nThis upcoming week is jam packed with a lot of earnings. What a perfect week for him to pull this shit. Anyways, I tried my best to cover all the good ones, but there were some I just could not get to as I have been locked in my room for two days straight making this. I need to get some sleep tonight as I have a date tomorrow.\n\nQuestions, comments, concerns, or suggestions, please let me know via comments or PM. This is my first ever DD and post on WSB. Enjoy! \n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c60UkwgegFHAnKo6Kpa75rvHwZ-0tPfgsIcnzgbf4AQ/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c60UkwgegFHAnKo6Kpa75rvHwZ-0tPfgsIcnzgbf4AQ/edit?usp=sharing)", "created_utc": 1572157902, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dnps0c/earnings_dd_week_of_oct_28th_nov_1st_2019/", "is_self": true}
