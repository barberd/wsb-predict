{"id": "b1hyxi", "title": "MCD: Classic Pennant formation!? Go long for possible new happy meal ATH?", "selftext": "[https://www.tradingview.com/x/05NF47uE/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/05NF47uE/)\n\nThere are two scenarios, one with purple arrows and one with yellow. Both have the same destination. This looks like a classic bullish pennant set up to me.\n\n **In Scenario 1** (purple arrow), it should get to 190 in this bull market by next week, imo. In this case, I'm looking at 3/22, 190calls, at 0/05 (right now). I might buy 100x of these for $500. If it touches 190, this should be about an 8k+ profit. \n\n**In Scenario 2** (yellow arrow), MCD dips back down to 181ish, where there is some support (see green line dividing the triangle). Either start scaling into calls soon, for 4/5 190c for 0.54ish, or 4/5 192.5c for 0.23ish. I'll have to think about sizing here. Tempted to buy 100x 4/5 192.5c, for $2.3k investment. If this is ITM by next Friday, this is 20k profit. If it's ITM by 3/29, this should be 8k+ profit. \n\nThe market is in full bull mode, and if this is a pennant set up, then we are looking at some serious happy meal tendies here. \n\nBy my understanding, MCD needs to close above 184 today, for scenario 1 to have  shot. \n\nLet me know your thoughts! I really like this play. Contemplating how I'm going to enter position now.
