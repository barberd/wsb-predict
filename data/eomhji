Please take it easy on my as I\u2019m only seeking knowledge and don\u2019t look forward to getting \ud83d\udca9 on. \n\nI\u2019ve been doing the call debit spreads, I figure bull market, I\u2019ll go bull and I did them with Tesla. On the day on deliveries announcement and Iran assignation  , the whole market was down except TSLA. I took my call debit spreads on 1/3 expiration from $960 to the full max profit of $3,840.  Stressfully and fun. \n\nI have another call debit spread on TSLA right now with 1/31 expirations. Only 1 contract \n\nSold $535 calls , bought $515 calls 1/31 expirations when the stock was around $495 on 1/8. \nThe stock once again went ape shit , and broke to $545 this morning, but I wasn\u2019t gaining max profit. \n\nWhich of the Greeks determine this ? As theta decays value ... does delta increase closer to expiration therefor increasing my total max profit? Basically I need to hold tight until 1/31 to get my max profit or next time yolo harder and do expirations within a few days like my last trade ( it was only 6 days between buying and expiration ) .", "created_utc": 1579014655, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eomhji/tsla_call_debit_spreads/", "is_self": true}
