If long , be giddy and try to sleep. If short be sad and try to sleep. Being half drunk something abe to sleep \n\n8 am - wake up have tea with spicy ginger to wake me up and have some breakfast. Take bath and get ready for work. In the shower daydream and strategise on what to do with positions when market opens but actually do something totally different based on tilt or if Ina profit enter some stocks and try to day trade and in 90 % of the cases end up losing more or lose the profit made\n\n9:30 am -4:00. Constantly refresh ticker prices, read yahoo message boards, Stocktwits ( after 2011). Enter exit positions randomly as still drunk from previous night. \n      Pretend to work ( IT software), procastrinating as much as possible. Not paying any attention to the job. Always stressed and thinking about stocks options charts rsi money flow obv etc. obsessed with the screen till 4:00\n\n5:00 pm start for home while thinking which single malt to drink and what to have for snack and dinner.\n6:00 - 10 pm.  Drink alcohol while playing poker and sports betting. Again reading message boards for the relevant stocks ( yahoo investors hub investor village etc ). As I get high and higher my poker play becomes erratic. People keep calling my heavy bluffs as they understand I am intoxicated due to my comments \n\n10 pm sleep as I am highly drunk. Don\u2019t know when I pass out \n\nThis was for weekdays\n\nOn weekends head straight to the casino on Friday and come back on Sunday \nThis with indulgence in 2-5 5-10 NLH poker games , hookers, alcohol ( through out the day), blackjack, roulette, baccarat\n\nAs I drive back keep thinking above poker plays huge pots stock plays TA. Come back drink again while bet on golf ( usually) and do laundry etc\n\nThis was the only constant. \n\nIf you have any similarities with this, stop take a break \n\nIn youth you can handle anything from alcohol to failures\n\nBut as you age , if you are constantly getting beat up or knocked down it is difficult to get back up and get pounded again. Eventually you will get knocked out as there is no referee to even stop the contest\n\nHope I entertained you and maybe even help you.\n\nBest wishes \ud83d\ude4f", "created_utc": 1579837336, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/et4qm2/day_in_the_life_of_degenerate_gambler_in_good_old/", "is_self": true}
