My dad is supposed to retire next year and the account is obviously deep in the red. They were discussing UAL's offer to place employees on a voluntary 6 month unpaid leave. \n\nHis manager told him, \"Your best chance is to buy Puts.\" \n\nHe then sent him a link to Robinhood. \n\nThat's right, Boomers have discovered Robinhood and think it's going to be their saving grace. \n\nUAL is fucked. \nPuts on every airline in the Star Alliance.", "created_utc": 1584846167.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmsq1x/puts_on_united_airlines/", "is_self": true}
