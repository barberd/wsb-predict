There labs are primarily located in California and I expect tons of people will need to be tested there!! They do have labs all over the US as well and they are directly working with HHS and CDC. I expect the stock to rise very quickly once they open testing next week, there will be a high fear still as more and more people die and get infected!!", "created_utc": 1583433827, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fdzuh4/opk_gonna_offer_us_wide_testing_for_covid19/", "is_self": true}
