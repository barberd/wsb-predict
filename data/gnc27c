{"id": "gnc27c", "title": "DD: bike company Dorel", "selftext": "Ok fellow autists and retards, hear me out this a short term play.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDorel is a montreal company specialized in bikes, home furniture, and children security stuff. Fundamentals of the company aren't incredible, making the stock not that expensive. I would not usually be attracted by such a company but, in these trying times using the bus or the metro is not as enjoyable as going for a ride on your own with your brand new bike.\n\nWe all saw what peleton did in the last month. Logically we should see the same trend with bike company. As an alternative to gym, outdoors activities and transport, bike sales could possibly surges this summer.\n\nSince a few days mass media has been selling us the idea of a bike shortage,\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/18/nyregion/bike-shortage-coronavirus.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/18/nyregion/bike-shortage-coronavirus.html)\n\n[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bike-sales-spike-vancouver-covid-travel-1.5572344](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bike-sales-spike-vancouver-covid-travel-1.5572344)\n\n[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/cycling-toronto-covid-19-1.5575937](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/cycling-toronto-covid-19-1.5575937)\n\nsince demand exceed supply we should see a rise in the value of the bike division of dorel. Wich could finally make the company profitable. I'm not saying these are guaranteed tendies but its better than an overbought shopify or a dead-end stock like cruise or airlines.\n\nThis is a stock play, volume is to low for options, im gonna take profit at 6.00$ and 7.00$ im in since yesterday.\n\nwhat do you guys think? btw i know the company has a bad reputation, but is the most mainstream i found in the north american market (canada mostly dont know about us)\n\n&#x200B;\n\npositions: 500 stocks bought at 4.50$ CAD selling 300 at 6$ and 200 at 7 or maybe more\n\nnote: sorry for my english, its in the otc stock market for the americans", "created_utc": 1589983988.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gnc27c/dd_bike_company_dorel/", "is_self": true}
