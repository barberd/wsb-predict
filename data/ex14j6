{"id": "ex14j6", "title": "The EU just voted to make iPhones and Androids all use USB C chargers.", "selftext": "Apple makes money off of every iPhone charger manufactured across the world. Anyone who makes one has to pay a licensing fee for *each individual cable* they make. Apple doesn\u2019t even have to manufacture anything, they just sit back and watch the money roll in. This nets Apple millions, if not hundreds of millions, per year. If iPhones have to start using USB C, this will be a real kick in the teeth for them. I don\u2019t see this completely plummeting the stock, but it\u2019s definitely going to drop as a result. Buy Apple puts now, or at least buy the fucking dip!", "created_utc": 1580533080, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ex14j6/the_eu_just_voted_to_make_iphones_and_androids/", "is_self": true}
