I'm willing to explain positions/strategy further if anyone is interested.   \nSafe to say it's easy to tell when I discovered WSB early in the fall. Though this community often receives criticism from many in the \"professional\" financial space, I have found it to be an incredible platform for learning. If you can learn to sift through the occasional \"GUH's\" and sprees of autism, much can be gained.   \nThank you again to everyone here who has continued to contribute. You all have made WSB one of my most visited pages on not only Reddit but the internet.   \nMerry Christmas!", "created_utc": 1577229518, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ef8om5/merry_christmas_109_ytd/", "is_self": true}
