I am a newb to options and tried closing one of the positions today with no luck. It was a limit order at the price shown it was worth in my account.\n\nFor example the Sept 20th is showing a current value of $2.57, but if I try to close the position the ask price is set at $1.80.. can someone please explain?", "created_utc": 1566600711, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/culaay/how_to_tell_if_there_is_a_good_likelihood_your/", "is_self": true}
