I have done a fair amount of research on past trends during market down turns and and if this is like most, it seems like we have a lot of potential to see some much further down lows.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? \n\nI\u2019m currently only holding AAPL and DIS puts right now. Sold most of my positions yesterday(felt like an autist when positions were worth x2 today), but wanted these to hold after I seen today\u2019s crash(bought at the low of today too, feels good being retarded).\n\nI just can\u2019t picture this market recovering and being sustained.\nThe corona has barely hit the US yet. We\u2019ve seen nothing but bullshit numbers thus far. We are just starting to see the panic. \n\nWhat could be a catalyst that turns this around? No vaccine is getting mass produced and released anytime soon. The government can inject as much as they want but it can\u2019t keep this up.\n\nWhat the fuck do you guys think?\n\nTL;dr: Why do you think the market might not go to absolute hell in the near future?\n\nEdit: My grammar is shit, I apologize.", "created_utc": 1583529866.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fekhvj/where_can_the_bottom_be/", "is_self": true}
