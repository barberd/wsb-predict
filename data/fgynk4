It\u2019s raining dicks out there, and I\u2019m the guy with the umbrella. Don\u2019t believe me? Keep reading.\n\nShortly after the H1N1 fiasco I shared a flight to Denmark with a highly placed WHO official who basically gave me a nine-hour seminar on virology (the real deal, not the shit Pearl Jam album). He made such an impact that last year I decided to write a hard SF novel on a near-future viral pandemic\u2014which I now have no hope of selling whatsoever. Because of that cosmic coincidence I\u2019ve been on this crisis since the first [stories](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/01/cases-spike-wuhan-mystery-pneumonia-cluster) began circulating in the New Year. It sounded so much like what dude had talked about that I began regularly trolling the web for reliable data. Then it was a matter of checking the boxes. Transmission rate substantially higher than flu. Asymptomatic transmission. CFR substantially higher than the flu. I realized very early that this was the real fucking deal, that it would be the biggest thing to hit us humies since WWII.\n\nThat\u2019s when I entered the WTF phase. It began with WTF are the Chinese doing, until they dropped the hammer and it became WTF is the WHO doing? I mean, the dude who told me was WHO! They. Fucking. Knew. And yet they not only jumped on the wishful thinking bandwagon, they gassed her up and stomped on it. Sure, they\u2019ve hit the brakes since, but tell that to your Grandpa\u2019s tombstone.\n\nThe CDC, however, didn\u2019t surprise me. I had learned about Trump successively cutting the CDC\u2019s budget, and dismantling the Whitehouse\u2019s pandemic preparedness team while researching my novel. What isn\u2019t widely reported is that he also tried to close down the [National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Biodefense_Analysis_and_Countermeasures_Center) at Fort Detrick, MD. I mean, what the fuck?!? I even\u2014and this blows my mind now\u2014joked to my buddies last summer that the Russians had probably instructed him to do so in preparation for a biological attack. (I don\u2019t believe this, being a big fan of [Hanlon\u2019s razor](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/Hanlon%E2%80%99s%20razor), but I hope some investigative reporter follows up, especially if the bug magically spares Moscow).\n\nMy biggest WTF, however, I reserved for the markets. One tenth of humanity was locked down, and they kept racking up record after record. I\u2019m still bedazzled by the daily demonstration of mass idiocy that is the world\u2019s financial system. Great Recession is a best case scenario. Remember this when it [begins raining CLO\u2019s](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mayrarodriguezvalladares/2019/09/22/leveraged-loans-and-collateralized-loan-obligations-are-riskier-than-many-want-to-admit/#467276506602). \n\nUp to this point I had been a pretty passive investor, chasing megatrends in my self-directed registered retirement account, and doing quite well. Thinking that every WTF must have an ETF exploiting it, I figured it was time to leap into financial action. I mean, I knew what was about to happen next. Not only was it written into SARS-CoV-2, it was written across Hubei province. What happened there, was going to happen here, only absent the Tyranny needed to set things aright.\n\nBut of course, there was no WTF ETF. So I decided to invent my own, and off I went into the thrilling, endlessly fascinating world of researching those sectors doomed to boom. Now I\u2019m not sure what to make of this sub\u2019s rules at this point, because it seems like I\u2019m supposed to be upfront about my positions without actually endorsing them. (I only found this (fucking brilliant) sub because of Bloomberg fretting about retail investors [actually passing enough wind to change the weather](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-26/reddit-s-profane-greedy-traders-are-shaking-up-the-stock-market)). So, I\u2019m going to stick to sectors and say, yes, I own a shitload in that sector.\n\nA little breather so that millennials can gas up their sputtering attention spans\u2026\n\nI\u2019m not a gambler: my only interest is to make enough money for my kids to have a chance of surviving the wheezing shambles my generation has made of this world (and for that I am more bloody sorry than you can know). Vaccines are hard as fuck to make, and even harder to make right. Remember that the common cold is a coronavirus. If you want to invest in a cure for the common cold, then, well, you\u2019re not investing, you\u2019re gambling. At least Vegas has buffets and hookers.\n\nDiagnostic testing isn\u2019t quite so bad as vaccines, but there\u2019s so many players, so many approaches, technologies, that you would need a big basket indeed to cover your downside. Just set aside a little money to straighten your crossed eyes afterward. To think of the t t i i m m e e I\u2019ve wasted.\n\nPersonal Protective Equipment (PPE) is a no brainer\u2014I made enough dough to compete with Papa Johns, but that ship has largely sailed investment wise. Short bait now, as far as I can tell.\n\nWhat\u2019s been entirely overlooked (because the market has been conditioned to see these as false alarms) is what happens to all that equipment: the instant it\u2019s used, it becomes medical waste, and medical waste requires specialized handling. Just check out Wuhan, which is [struggling to deal with mountains of it](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/coronavirus-china-struggling-deal-mountain-130909288.html). As with the PPE sector, there\u2019s only a couple of players that are not either privately owned or overexposed to the suction that will be generated by the greater market. \n\nWhat\u2019s also been (almost) entirely overlooked is respiratory medical devices and services, especially ventilators and ECMOs. You need to take care, here, because some companies (like the one inspiring my weaselly \u2018almost\u2019) are utterly dependent on the big red Chinese teat. Read those Q4 teleconference transcripts!\n\nAnd the thing to remember about SARS-COV-2 is that it\u2019s not going away with the bad weather. It\u2019s already considered endemic, meaning it\u2019s going to pass through us in waves that might be seasonal, or might not. There's a good chance all these sectors all across the world are going to need to expand permanently, as well as build in the excess capacity required to handle periodic surges. This is the new reality. The new economy. Bioeconomics.\n\nAnd at present, (almost) all the companies comprising them are trading (like WHO is speaking) as if the pandemic hasn\u2019t already happened. Like I say, WTF.\n\nConsider your ass covered. \n\nThe veil of tears is almost upon us, my friends. I have no umbrella for that.", "created_utc": 1583939546.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fgynk4/doomed_to_boom_sectors_that_eat_vectors/", "is_self": true}
