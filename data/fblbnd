All my other positions are puts, but I\u2019m under the assumption TDOC should be going up due to the virus. \n\nThe US only has 3 hospital beds per 1,000 individuals and the CDC even said only critically ill people need to go to the hospital. \n\nOur hospitals can\u2019t handle Coronavirus like China can. Hell, I think China built a building for patients in under 14 days. \n\nWith this limited DD, is it safe to assume TDOC could be mooning in the next couple weeks with most \u201chealthy\u201d Coronavirus patients needing to use TDOC to speak to a doctor?\n\nI\u2019m in on the 4/17 $180 calls...hopefully I get my tendies! If not, my Puts will cover the losses \ud83e\udd23", "created_utc": 1583019958, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fblbnd/is_teladoc_tdoc_going_up_on_this_bad_news/", "is_self": true}
