Living in Germany, there's no need for me to actually pay for college tuition so I did the smartest thing that came to my mind: Risk it all buying CFDs.\n\nThat's right, I am risking roughly 4800 of my 5000$ buying 2000 CFD's of $MRO. Thank god the margin requirements are only about 20%, so my profits will be immense.\n\nMark my words, I will buy my AMG at age 19. If not, I will lose all my savings.\n\nI'm pretty confident tho so let's goo, my stop loss is at 1.90$\n\nSame day Edit: Damn, many of you are proper autists", "created_utc": 1587116594.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2yvg3/17_year_old_autist_yoloing_away_his_hs_graduation/", "is_self": true}
