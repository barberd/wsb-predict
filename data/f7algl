A friend of mine showed me some tricks but he just has shares and makes like 20% a year. But when i see the succes stories on here from people who make 20k from 500 my eyes see dollar signs \ud83e\udd11.\n\nF\\*ck his shares. I want to learn options.\n\nI'm 25 and Belgian so sometimes the English Financial terms take a bit longer to understand.\n\n**If i understand correct an option is for example:**\n\n21/02/2020 - GOOGLE = 20$ for a share \n\nI predict (or hear from you guys) that this share will go 25$ before 21/03/2020.\n\nThen I buy a contract of 100 shares for like 1,20$ each so in total 120$.\n\nAnd if the share goes to let's say 25$ BEFORE 23/02/2020. I make 120 x 5 = 600$\n\nCan I hold it until lets say 28$ and sell it for more?\n\nBut the only way to lose the 120$ is if the price of the share is not 25$ at 21/03/2020 right?  \nOr can you lose it another way? Can you lose more than 120? That they take from your trader account?\n\nWhat happens if the price is 23$ at 23/02/2020 and not 25$. Can you still sell your option? For less I imagine?\n\nAny have experience trading options with DEGIRO?\n\nThanks for helping a noobie out. When i'm a billionaire i'll throw a party for the people who helped me.", "created_utc": 1582289142, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7algl/can_someone_shortly_explain_what_options_are/", "is_self": true}
