Hence his press conference and twitter rants on that subject.\n\nIf we look out to 2020 elections next year, what would be very trump-like, would to be him continuing the trade war going, which then probs the FED to cut rates more aggressively than they would have. \nThen in the first quarter of that year. Trump announces an end to the Trade war, which creates a great boost in the stock market, prefect timing for the next presidential elections. \n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Trump would have done this, like the announcements that ISIS is defeated before the mid-terms.\n\nThe new deal with China will be the same as the USMCA deal, same thing different name.  Maybe two or three changes like the dairy implementation in usmca that wasn\u2019t in nafta.", "created_utc": 1567090613, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cx20v8/trump_china_and_the_federal_reserve/", "is_self": true}
