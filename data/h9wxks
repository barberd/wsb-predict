In 2020 they reported had just over 700,000.  ( [https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2020/06/13/hertz-used-car-sales-deals-bankruptcy-coronavirus/3182105001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2020/06/13/hertz-used-car-sales-deals-bankruptcy-coronavirus/3182105001/) )\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's a shitload of cars about to hit the market if Hertz goes completely tits up.  That's a lot of cheap used cars.  Dirt cheap.  The kind of cheap that fucks new car sales.  Fucked new car sales means auto makers start having problems.  The kind of problems that require a big fat government bail out or auto workers make headlines joining the breadlines.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow bad can it be?  Well two of the most common rental rides are Fords and Toyotas.  Cheap rides easy, low overhead when you buy in bulk and can be flipped to the wholesaler market with ease as opposed to BMWs, Mercedes and other up scale brands.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen a rental ride has reached the end of it's usefulness to a rental company it gets sent off to a wholesale auction.  Like the one in Manhiem PA.  Nothing much there except a giant facility running tens of thousands of cars through auction a week.  Basically people stand in an aisle as cars roll past, bid lists in hand winking and nodding hoping to get a car cheap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe nice rental rides go to outfits like Carmax where they aim to only buy cars they have to dump about 2500 bucks into to get showroom ready.  It's how they keep their prices cheap and can do the no haggle thing.  The banged up rides end up at buy-here-pay-here places that have made loan sharking an art.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo suddenly used Fords and Toyotas from anywhere from 10,000 miles to 120,000 miles are out there on the market.  What is Ford going to do with their new line?  2021 models are just starting to roll off the line and into the market in time for the close of the year.  Same as Toyota.  Before 2020 is over their new car line hits right towards the end of the year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what happens to all those unsold 2020s?  You guessed it off to the auction where dealers can hedge their losses by selling them at auction.  They might have bought it from the factory for 30,000 and they have likely financed those purchases.  So they make money on selling you financing at a much higher rate, add-ons, and warranties.  But when that doesn't happen they have a 30,000 lump of plastic crap taking up space, getting older on the the lot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo off the the auction where they hope to sell it close to what they paid for it.  And the car buyers know this.  They will sit there and let the dealer no sell for a few weeks till the floor drops.  The dealer let's a bunch go and then tightens up again in hopes of raising the floor next week.  This bleeding process goes on all year 2 to 3 times a week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo now you have your regular inventory that shows up to one of these auctions.  Suddenly now you have Hertz dumping its entire fleet.  Cheap cars, cheap inventory and the savings gets passed onto the consumer.  So many cars the only thing to do is sell them ASAP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou don't need a new car if you can get a deal on a cheap rental ride.  Ford and Toyota can't sell their new models, that means they don't need employees and that means a shit load of auto workers out of job IN AN ELECTION YEAR.  Ford is a classic American brand that's mostly manufactured overseas, and Toyota last time I checked employs the most American autoworkers.  That's some real shitty optics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what's cheaper, paying Hertz to stay in business and not dump a shit ton of wrecks on the market.  Or bailing out at least one major automaker when new car sales tank due to a flood of cheap cars?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf the government intervenes.  Buy Calls Hertz.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf the government fucks everyone.  Puts on Hertz, Ford, Toyota.  Buy Calls Carmax, cheap inventory and ruthless reconditioning process and workplace environment will see their stock rise.\\*  You can probably do puts on the other American Automakers too as the panic from lagging new car sales seeps into MM collective thinking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*In case you are still wondering how they rose from 67 dollars to 93 over the past 4 years it isn't sales.  They drastically slashed their overhead by replacing most of their work force from \"salaried management\" making 38 to 50k a year to 15 dollar and hour wage slaves that doing the same job.  They still have buyers but only a few of them now.  They still have a huge spending budget so they still get to bully auctions into taking cars back, ripping up bills of sale if they buy the wrong car in an auction lane, have their meals and lodgings paid for buy the auction facility because they dunk that much cash into the coffers.  I'll do a breakdown one day of why KMX is a company to watch for decline over the next 10 years.", "created_utc": 1592283170.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h9wxks/why_hertz_has_to_get_bailed_out_and_why_the/", "is_self": true}
