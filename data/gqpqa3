{"id": "gqpqa3", "title": "PRPL to $19+ by 8/12 (ER). Calling it again!", "selftext": "# tl;dr\n\n[PRPL](https://purple.com/) is killing it.  They've seen a dramatic shift in their business to online sales from wholesale partners, which may be here to stay.  I [called the pre-ER price range last quarter](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g30vst/covid_recovery_play_prpl_to_1214_by_512_and_2024/), and I'm calling it again:  $19+ before earnings (approx 8/12).  Quick movements will cause this to squeeze up and even meme up.\n\nBuy calls (options made available for the first time on 5/21!), warrants (PRPLW), or stock.  Hold for the run up to ER and after if you are the type.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst, let's talk about what the stock has been doing.\n\n# What Happened After the Last ER?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1lhgec5zv0151.png?width=870&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbc4228f71cb3336eaee281876f01ee8d1022b34\n\n[PRPL killed earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gi2hed/prpl_killed_earnings_tendies_can_still_be_made/).  They absolutely could not have had a better earnings release and earnings call.   Go read that link to learn more.\n\n**Why did the stock go down!?!**\n\nThat's easy.   The founders decided to offer their shares for sale via a secondary offering (note:  this offering was the founders selling, so it was non-dilutive).\n\nThe net effect of this was a few days of suppressed stock price and warrants price.   If you held a few days past earnings, you are positive again on the stock and the warrants from pre-earnings.\n\n**What I think may have happened...**\n\nThis may come across as a little tin foil hat, so feel free to take it with a grain of salt.\n\nIf you read [page 98 of the S-3 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1643953/000119312520140451/d922462ds3a.htm) for the secondary offering, you will notice that the underwriters\n\n>may engage in transactions that ***stabilize*** the price of the Class\u00a0A Common Stock, ***such as bids or purchases to peg, fix or maintain that price***.  \n>  \n>In connection with the offering, the underwriters may purchase and sell our Class\u00a0A Common Stock in the open market. These transactions ***may include short sales***, purchases on the open market to cover positions created by short sales and stabilizing transactions.\n\nThe days following the offering were characterized by multiple breakouts up that then saw immediate pull backs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dmmwjh42y0151.png?width=516&format=png&auto=webp&s=65db64407f6c87b8695a7a356b698e69e45752c3\n\nMy theory is that the underwriters were managing the stock down for the offering in order to maximize value for those who were purchasing the securities (and for themselves), much to the detriment of the founders who were selling them.\n\nRegardless, we don't trade on tinfoil hats.   Let's talk about what we ***do know***.\n\n# Coliseum Capital Management\n\nColiseum Capital Management was an early and frequent investor in PRPL.   They have about $413M in assets under management.  They also have a seat on the Board of Directors at PRPL.\n\n[Previous to this filing on May 19 and the secondary offering](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001643953/b9ca31d0-460e-490b-91f4-3b3c7a651259.html), they held 8,226,149 shares through collective entities and individuals.   As of the filing, they've increased their ownership to 16,956,602!!!  That means they are now holding 41% or so interest in the company (far more than the other 73 institutional owners).\n\nAnother way to look at it, is they bought up most of the secondary.   Coliseum YOLO'd $231.8M of their $413M fund on PRPL!!!   One of us!  One of us!    Maybe someone can get them to do a YOLO post around here...\n\nThese guys are insiders and they just bought up every share they probably could in the secondary.   If I'm reading into it right, they even created a new fund (which means a new cash raise) in order to buy more.   This gives me ***A LOT of confidence*** in my PRPL investment to see an insider with capital try and gobble up as many shares as possible.\n\n# What's Next for PRPL?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8638vqgwz0151.png?width=877&format=png&auto=webp&s=b18dd65b96d0936db839a8fa69d1a1626dc95486\n\nFor those of you who have been following the stock, we've been in this exact scenario before.   The founders held a secondary offering immediately after the stock posted its first quarterly profit, which pulled down the price of the stock.   The stock remained depressed for a couple weeks after completion of the secondary, and then began a months long run up to correct the price per the last earnings release.\n\nWe've just gone through an amazing earnings release where the CEO & CFO basically let us know PRPL is going to blow it out of the water in Q2 (To understand how big of a blow out, Wedbush Securities increased their guidance to $0.24 per share-- or pretty much the full year's worth of pre-COVID guided earnings ***in a single quarter***).\n\nI expect doldrums for a week or so on this stock, and then we will begin another climb to $19+ ahead of earnings.   This stock ***should*** currently be trading at $20-$24.  Now is the time to buy your options, shares, and warrants.   I will be doing so even more this week.\n\nBrian Nagel of Oppenheimer, one of the top rated analysts on Wall Street, agrees.   He reiterated a $19 price target for the stock immediately after earnings.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i05tag4b11151.png?width=332&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bb47683e0d37f2ee88a3acdb148d1eb289d68c6\n\n# What about the numbers?\n\n[Actuals plus my estimates for Q2 2020](https://preview.redd.it/jogsmnty31151.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=acbf72b67d33b6d057a42ae439abfb126382c0c4)\n\nWe know from the earnings call that PRPL did $54M in orders in April alone on the DTC side only.April's YoY growth on the DTC side was 170%; however, we know that the first half of April was slow, which means the back half was higher than 170%, and per the call, the growth rate on the back half has been sustained.\n\nWholesale sales were down 47% YoY in April.   Although sequential weeks were showing sales growth, I kept the April rate through the rest of the quarter.\n\nI held marketing expenses steady as a % of sales in my projections for the low side, but we also learned from the earnings call that much of the growth was organic, which means we would expected marketing as a % of sales to decrease.\n\nThe G&A estimates were based upon comments from the call with the conservative side keeping G&A flat as a % of sales, with the optimistic side making the G&A less variable, but still the highest quarter of G&A to date.\n\nWe are in for a fantastic quarter with somewhere between 30M-50M in operating income, which would be pretty much the whole year's previously forecasted Adjusted EBITDA.\n\n# Notes on the Securities\n\nPRPL's options chain was opened up on Thursday last week for the first time.   As you would expect, volume and open interest is still very low.   Not a lot of market making going on as of yet.  A few of us spent Thursday and Friday dancing around with bids.   The January's are a pretty good value in my opinion.   I'm looking at picking up a bunch of Octobers.\n\nPRPL stock is still a mid-market stock, which means you won't see S&P 500 volumes.   Trade accordingly.\n\nPRPLW warrants are still the best bet in my opinion.  They are call warrants (just like options) with a 2/2023 expiry and an effective strike price of $11.50 (two warrants for one share).\n\n# My Holdings\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ylo1pc651151.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2bbb967a18498ffdda48d7ba055b71151ee3be84\n\nI am long 521,400 PRPLW warrants.  I sold 7,013 of my short term PRPLW from earnings in order to start playing with PRPL options.\n\nI'm not your investment advisor and this doesn't constitute investment advice.
