{"id": "gnb1mm", "title": "Tanker Gang Update - FRO", "selftext": "Alright remaining tanker bagholders, here we fucking go. Another day of amazing earnings, which means we're all about to get smacked by the biggest red dildo ever.\n\nFRO is reporting earnings right now, and they crushed it, obviously. Net Income in Q1 2020 of $165.3 million, compared to $40 million in Q1 2019. Yes, you read that right, an increase of 4.0x. Dividend announced of $0.70 PER SHARE, that's another 10% yielding tanker you autistic fuckheads.\n\nRates are still high as fuck, although the earnings report does expect Q2 2020 to close slightly weaker than the chart below, obviously because we were all duped by the oil contract expiry. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rjg4n6ww4xz41.png?width=855&format=png&auto=webp&s=7456d9bd3852b20340e966970044f3cd6c083a25\n\nNot only that, but FRO also mentioned in their earnings report that the fleet outlook, as in the fleet supply compared to fleet demand, has not been this promising since 1997. THAT MEANS IT IS TIME FOR THE NEXT SUPER CYCLE.\n\nSO LISTEN UP YOU FUCKS; Here's the deal. Tankers are owned about 80% by institutions, and they've been writing calls on the shares they have been holding for years. Well, the next tanker super cycle is about to hit and the market gets cute and buys up all of these calls. So what do they do? They sell off like crazy to crush all your tendies, and they keep their call premiums because they're sure as fuck not going to let you have their shares that cheap. HERE'S THE BEST PART: They hold these stocks for the dividends, which means they will buy them back at these low prices and will be lauded as heroes for getting such an insane dividend yield during this crazy market.  \n\n\nWe would have better luck with options if we were able to play ex-dividend dates instead of earnings dates, because these institutions do want this crazy dividend yield.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: FRO earnings were HUGE, therefore buy PUTS and SELL THE SHIT OUT OF NAKED CALLS this shit is going to fucking 0. Buy shares if you have small dicks like me. If you have a huge penis, then buy calls based on ex-div dates and watch your tendies fucking print.", "created_utc": 1589980176.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gnb1mm/tanker_gang_update_fro/", "is_self": true}
