{"id": "hepwm1", "title": "Urus or Model 3?", "selftext": "Majority holding in MSFT LEAPS. Should i sell or wait till $280-300? I believe it will reach this price only if they make a major acquisition like salesforce(CRM) since they are weak in the ERP sector and their CRM tool dynamics 365 is not that great.\n\n**Bull case:** MSFT has .Net, SQL Server, GIT Hub, Microsoft Dynamics 365 for developers. Office 365, Teams, Linkedin,  Windows & Azure for consumers & enterprise. Hololens and JEDI deal with military and believe sales will eventually move them to a MSFT shop. \n\nNew Xbox releasing this year, strategic partnership with Sony that allows Sony to leverage xCloud. xCloud is a direct competitor to google's Stadia, multi year partnership with NBA that allows fan engagement with Azure (Believe since Ballmer is the owner of clippers he might have a hand in it) and recent partnership with Facebook by killing off mixer. Eventually FB HTML cloud games will stream using xCloud aka Azure. Into hardware with surface products etc..\n\n**Bear Case** P/E of 34 which is expensive, if the whole market falls MSFT goes down with the market even though it's completely diversified. Lackluster buyback program with **7.5B** outstanding shares on the market which might make the stock price stagnant. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ye04z0pmsq651.png?width=1216&format=png&auto=webp&s=59f5dac14f9c204abd0d5f14f9eef578723ac9db", "created_utc": 1592955792.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hepwm1/urus_or_model_3/", "is_self": true}
