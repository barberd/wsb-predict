Anyone that is just bored and trolling with no knowledge of economics don\u2019t bother reading.", "selftext": "From NYC the Capital of Capital Markets is literally decayed. Construction already defaulting has gotten worse. NYC does not sell this land,therefore they end up with the debt. I would like to go back to October and the first pump by the Fed to solve a liquidity issue in overnight funding. The market was running out of gas for a lot longer than March and the major dip. With MAIN-STREET not getting the funding they need is causing a massive disconnect between the television and the reality. When the dip happened I went short on puts. As of today I am down 17K with huge long shots to get back in this. I no longer believe in the process. This game was fun because you could lose. Charts meant something. I have switched to ETH based on the theory the ER20 TOKEN will drive ETH as it progresses. Blockchain is the future this is not a fact it\u2019s beliefs. The market is not running on any fundamentals it\u2019s a runaway train.
