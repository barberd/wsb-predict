{"id": "fi0xhs", "title": "DD collaboration request: High-yield Bond Maturity Dates & associated swaps", "selftext": "Alright tards, listen up: the corporate debt bubble is going to pop. How? When companies go to refinance their short term debts this summer, it will be too risky for firms to take on that debt. The premiums that they will charge companies to refinance their debt will be too much for companies who just watched their revenues evaporate for 2 months. And if firms don't refinance their debts, the CDSs start flaring and firms start going bankrupt on both sides of the fence.\n\nWe don't yet know if the extent that revenues will be hit for corporations, but what we do know is that there is a tremendous amount of leverage in the systems that is at risk of not being refinanced - that is certain.\n\nSo here's where we can all stand to benefit from decentralized autism: for those of us that don't have a bloomberg terminal, where can we find:\n\n1.) SEC filings or a database that compiles maturity dates for high-yield bonds that have been issued in the past 1-5 years? We're looking for high-yield bonds (BB+ or lower) that have maturity dates within the next 1-6 months. With that information, we can assess the balance sheet of at-risk companies and evaluate the overall leverage that company currently has. \n\n2.) Where can we find a database or SEC filings detailing the Credit Default Swaps associated with those maturing bonds and what firms issued those CDSs?\n\nThe play: \n\nA. buying deeeeep OTM puts with 6+ month expirations for the companies that have significant exposure to maturing bonds. \n\nB. Buying OTM puts on the firms responsible for insuring those bond defaults.", "created_utc": 1584111533.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fi0xhs/dd_collaboration_request_highyield_bond_maturity/", "is_self": true}
