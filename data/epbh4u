{"id": "epbh4u", "title": "$MTCH Quietly reaching all-time highs, lube up and get in.", "selftext": "The dating landscape has changed drastically over the last 10 years, and now, more than ever, people are switching to online dating as their go-to for relationships, sex, etc. I\u2019m not here to get you laid, but as an online dating field mouse and Digital Advertiser, I\u2019m going give you the DD that\u2019ll grow your portfolio. \n\nFrom 2000-2013, OKcupid, Match, Eharmony and Plenty of Fish (POF) ruled the dating world. \u00be are now owned by $MTCH. Currently, Tinder rules the scene. It\u2019s easy to see why online dating has been successful, but what makes these sites profitable and why the fuck would you want to invest?  \n\n$MTCH\u2019s has seen [steady growth](https://www.statista.com/statistics/449390/quarterly-revenue-match-group/) each quarter since they\u2019ve hit the market, and even with the IAC split, they've still been going strong \n\nAnd while $MTCH owns quite a few dating companies, the biggest money makers for them are Match.com, OkCupid, Plenty of Fish, and by far, Tinder.   \n   \nMatch.com has always been free to look, but pay to play. Want to message that cute girl? Pay us $30 a month. Then there is the 3-month guarantee that you'll find the one, put another $90 behind that, sucka. It\u2019s not nearly as prolific as it once was, but it\u2019s still currently the home to some desperate ladies who think a paid site will weed out the thirsty dudes, and of course, the same average thirsty dudes.   \n   \nOKcupid is currently suffering a fate worse than death: A lack of identity. It was the most celebrated and lauded free dating website until about 2017, when it was eventually taken over by $MTCH. They took everything people loved about it and tossed it out the window. It now resembles a clunky Tinder wannabe with math and more bots than Wall-E. How do they make money? A-list, something that men can even gift to women they like, which those ladies in turn, can go find some other dude on the site to date. Touch\u00e9, OkCupid. Unfortunately, the site is such a mess that it\u2019ll be completely dead in a few years, if not, this year.   \n   \nPlenty of Fish\u2026sigh. I\u2019ll be honest; this is the Wal-Mart of online dating. I\u2019ve only ever been on one date from the site years ago. She tricked me with her angles and I swore off the site, never to look back. Its user base hasn\u2019t changed much over the years according to most, and houses some of the most bottom of the barrel people to exist in the U.S. It also surprisingly-unsurprisingly still has the most activity of any online dating site or app. Boosted by its POF Premium package which apparently tricks people into thinking that it will help them get more matches, it\u2019s been a good source of revenue for $MTCH since 2015.\n\nNow to the moneymaker, Tinder, also owned by $MTCH. A few years ago, Tinder executed the ultimate drug dealer move; got people hooked for free then started charging people for it, and somehow maintained their user base.  They introduced Tinder+ ($20 a month) and Tinder Gold ($30 a month), along with super swipe, and boost, and most recently: Super Boost ($45-$100 depending on your area, for a ONE time use). You can go over to r/tinder to see what these paid tools have done to these horny guys. I myself haven\u2019t had a date using Tinder since late 2018 and switched from it in early 2019, as I\u2019m not a fan of paying to play. But the amount of free advertising it gets from movies, tv shows, podcast, comics, etc. is not something to take lightly. \n\nThe one thing $MTCH won\u2019t tell you about Tinder is their male to female ratio. The last time they did was in 2016, which even then was heavily skewed in favor of men. According to some recent studies, the male to female ratio is around 85% to 15%., but the popularity for the app has not decreased. One is to surmise that an increase in dudes is an increase in profits. \n\nCompetition? Bumble is a good app that puts the \u201cpower\u201d into women\u2019s hands by having them make the first move, but as a recent hookup put it, \u201cI got what men want, why would I need to waste effort by messaging first.\u201d Where\u2019d I meet this \"catch?\u201d Hinge. Hinge, also owned $MTCH, has steadily become my go to in the last 2 years, as it has a nice interface, it\u2019s easy to navigate and allows you to send a quick message along with your \u2018like\u2019 to get the lady\u2019s attention. However, Bumble is increasing their users at a rapid rate and is only second to Tinder in regards to online dating apps, but it\u2019s doubtful that they will ever pass Tinder.   \n \n\nFacebook Dating is about 8 years too late. If POF is the Wal-Mart of dating, Facebook Dating is the Dollar Tree. Facebook is dominated by the 40+ crowd and won\u2019t be relevant until they introduce Instagram dating, which would be an epic move on their part since it houses the majority of the people likely to use any of the aforementioned apps, sites previously mentioned.   \n \n\nEHarmony?[\ud83d\ude02](https://emojipedia.org/face-with-tears-of-joy/) [\ud83d\ude02](https://emojipedia.org/face-with-tears-of-joy/) [\ud83d\ude02](https://emojipedia.org/face-with-tears-of-joy/)[\ud83d\ude02](https://emojipedia.org/face-with-tears-of-joy/)  \n   \nYou can check out the online dating trend line since 2004 [here](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;geo=US&amp;q=%2Fm%2F0wfqsst,%2Fm%2F08ddtl,%2Fm%2F05rbwm,match.com,%2Fm%2F013cct59)\n\nTo conclude in my experience, you can\u2019t underestimate what $MTCH has. People are lazy and want to put as little effort into things as possible these days. Why talk to that hot girl sitting across from me in the coffee shop when I can I pull out an app and easily score a date with a 5/10. $MTCH has cornered the online dating marketing and as always, sex is in demand and like theta gang $MTCH sells both \u201ccalls\u201d and puts\u201d and people are buying both in bulk.     \n \n\nTL;DR: Long Calls or stocks for $MTCH", "created_utc": 1579135492, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/epbh4u/mtch_quietly_reaching_alltime_highs_lube_up_and/", "is_self": true}
