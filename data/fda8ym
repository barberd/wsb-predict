Trust me, I already know I\u2019m retarded", "selftext": "So, in typical retard fashion, I yolo\u2019d my tiny little account on an APT call last week with a strike price of $15 and an expiration of 3/20. \n\nObviously I should\u2019ve held but can\u2019t now. I sold on Friday. It was a naked call, because I had no idea what I was doing. With the little bit of knowledge I\u2019ve gained since I understand that I might be on the hook for 100 shares of APT for whoever bought it if it\u2019s still in the money on 3/20? Is this correct? Did I completely fuck myself and potentially throw myself into debt?", "created_utc": 1583311754, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fda8ym/help_trust_me_i_already_know_im_retarded/", "is_self": true}
