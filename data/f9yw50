{"id": "f9yw50", "title": "my dog's bull balls", "selftext": "Early Monday morning I dropped off my dog to get his balls chopped off. He was whining the entire time as I checked futures and saw they were pretty side ways. Filled out some papers at the vet then went home. Right at the hour stocks began to drop I got a phone call from the vet. \"Hello your dogs ball removal was a complete success. Come get him when he wakes up\". To my autistic surprise the market crashes right there. To top it off the market crashes the next day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy hypothesis: My dog's balls held magical powers that made stocks go up. Now that his powers have been snipped the market has been punished for each ball cut off dramatically. This week however we are  getting him vaccinated, so we should see some autistic injections by the Fed Friday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Buy calls on AAPL Thursday at close.", "created_utc": 1582746155, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9yw50/my_dogs_bull_balls/", "is_self": true}
