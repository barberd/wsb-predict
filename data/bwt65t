It's been helpful as I have made a few hundred dollars following this patten.\n\nI'm a bit skeptic this time as they are presenting in the Bank of America Global Technology Conference. The stock is almost 29.5 ( 29.43 and rising at the time of writing). I don't know if I should buy Puts or not.\n\nWhat would you guys suggest?\n\nSincerely,\n\nA guy who has college fees to pay\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I bought June 14, 29.5 Put.
