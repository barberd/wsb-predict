They have inserted the antigen for COVID into tobacco plants. My first thought is this has to be a ploy by BTI to prop up their stock price during this crisis and/or solicit $$$$ from governments/partners.  It raises many questions.\n\nThis article explains plant-based vaccines:\n[Science Shit](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jb/2016/4928637/)\n\n> There is no plant-based vaccine that has received the license from US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This is due to the fact that plant-based vaccines are classified under the genetically modified crop category\n\n[Another Supporting article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4667769/)\n\n> On the other hand, plant-based human vaccines are not yet commercialized\n\nI\u2019m not gonna sit here and pretend that I knew anything about this before 15 minutes ago, but it smells shitty from where I\u2019m sitting. The articles are a few years old, but I have little faith in big tobacco saving america.\n\nAlso the volume here is 0 for a lot of trades so take that at face value. Maybe make a few bucks, not looking at a $100k move.\n\n\nTLDR: BTI 5/15 30p", "created_utc": 1585754692.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ft1sv8/big_tobacco_saves_america_bti/", "is_self": true}
