As always, I love to read everyone's feedback, so if you have any comments, questions, or concerns, do not hesitate to ask.\n\nNote: I do not condone private prisons. This is an objective evaluation.\n\n**Not only is $GEO's core business relatively unaffected in the short term, but strong insider buying signals upside potential.**\n\nAlthough GEO's positioning in private prison operations (as a diversified REIT) are unsustainable in the long-term, in the short-term, GEO's relatively unaffected bottom-line and strong insider-buying signal 20%+ upside potential.\n\nBecause of guaranteed contracts spanning multiple years, GEO's operations have been unaffected for the most part, with only one downgrade since February (which was by JP Morgan in response to poor Q4 results and uncertainty about business model sustainability. Their target was lowered to $26, representing 112% upside as of writing). In addition to sustained targets, GEO has seen considerable insider buying since late February, with insiders loading up on $12.5 million in shares. Most recent insider buying occurred in early May, with CEO George Zoley accumulating over $2.5 million in shares. But despite these strong signals and a relatively unaffected model, GEO has fallen to lows of $11 off a 52-week high of $24. With little recovery ($12.22 as of writing), there is significant upside.\n\nLong term, GEO is not as sustainable, with major institutions refusing to finance private prison operations (GEO is specifically controversial because of their ICE contracts) and a weak balance sheet that questions The Geo Group's solvency. GEO\u2019s debt/equity and LT debt/equity ratios are considerably weak, with $2.7 billion in LT debt obligations and an average $150 million in annual interest expense weighing down net income, despite only $35 million in cash on hand as of their recent earnings call. Although GEO has a $350 million dollar revolving credit facility, their controversial operations damage their ability to secure credit going forward.\n\nIn the short term, GEO has major upside potential, with a possible recovery in the $15-$20 range possible by the end of the year.", "created_utc": 1590549330.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/grbqkc/geo_52620_the_geo_group_geo_continues_to/", "is_self": true}
