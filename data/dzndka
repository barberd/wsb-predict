{"id": "dzndka", "title": "Question on Selling a Call Option", "selftext": "I'm new to options and am trying to understand the decision of selling a call option. \n\nIf I were to sell a call option for a profit, wouldn\u2019t I now be obligated to sell shares of the underlying stock to the buyer of my call option if his BE price was met and he decided to exercise? Because the unlimited loss potential this creates for myself, wouldn\u2019t it be a better decision to just exercise my option for a profit rather than sell it? This way I don\u2019t take on the risk of the underlying stock continuing to rise and potentially being forced to sell shares of the stock for a loss.", "created_utc": 1574360226, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dzndka/question_on_selling_a_call_option/", "is_self": true}
