The idea was that on May 9 we began creeping towards oversold.  When you trend oversold, it can take some time to find the top, and price velocity can increase upwards while it searches.  SPY sold off \\~3.75 points on the first test, \\~4.5 points on the second test, \\~6.75 points on the third test, all the while remaining oversold. \n\nBy June 3rd, the oscillator was at 72.36, and I was expecting a \\~10 point correction, one I could make good money on.  I felt relatively safe, given even if the move was weak, I should be able to exit.  What I didn't forsee, was how weak the movement would be (\\~1.75 points), and how abrupt the punch up would be, buoyed by apparently incorrect unemployment numbers.\n\nHindsight being what it is, I still can't find a great exit, just bad luck.  I suppose I could have gotten worried after the 5th candle pushed the oscillator below 60 and just taken profit.  We closed on a red candle, I opted to hold, and the position vanished.\n\nThe real frustrating aspect is I then didn't play the 5th peak, which would have seen an entry around the 321 price point, and which would have caught the 6+ point plunge last night.  This compounded the annoyance.  The challenge with playing there, is I would have entered on June 8th around 321, it would have popped to 323, maybe I average down and ride it, but it took a solid 11 candles for definitive movement.  After such a bad miss, that's a tough entry.\n\n# Probability and Reflection\n\nThis type of play is based on probability, but probability isn't a guarantee.  I unfortunately played literally the worst peak of the 5 peaks I identified, and lost as a result.  I should have exited sooner after we popped, that would have shaved $500+ off the loss, my biggest mistake of the play.\n\nI would play it again, the TA still holds, probability always sees me green in the end.  Though I do owe WSB a bit of an apology as since I opened my mouth, I've been on a bit of an unfortunate run.  So for that, I apologize, I'll try to be better next time.\n\n# The Next Play\n\nNow that I've apologized, let's get back to ~~losing~~ making money.\n\nI play this type of TA in both directions.  I missed the blow off, and boy does that sting.  Good news though, ES is approaching overbought, hasn't seen this level since May 14th.  We've got a bull market, and positive divergences in our favor, entering a call position here doesn't carry nearly the risk.\n\nWhat we want now is to acknowledge velocity can pick up down here.  We will likely test the 311 mark at a minimum, one could try and catch the falling knife here, if you strongly believe we'll punch through the 310 level, or believe we need to retest the FIB to set it as support.  I can see us going as low as 308, but have a really hard time seeing us below that currently.  Bears just don't have that kind of momentum.\n\nI'll be adding comments here, looking for a bottom, and plotting an entry.  You're welcome to follow along, even play.  Comments are answered, and you're always welcome to point and laugh.", "created_utc": 1591873433.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h0x71f/normie_playbook_analyzing_a_failed_play/", "is_self": true}
