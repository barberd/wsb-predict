Just here to give my opinion on Fitbit today. As we can see in the news Fitbit is shifting it\u2019s supply chain resources to make emergency ventilators designed to treat coronavirus patients.\n\nhttps://www.nationalheraldindia.com/amp/story/international%2Ffitbit-to-build-ventilators-for-covid-19-patients\n\nThis is what caught my eye and so I decided to take a look around the charts. Seems FIT has decided to form a Bullish Bat pattern and with this news it\u2019s right at the entry point. \n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/chart/FIT/aDVtgelW-Fitbit-Bullish-Bat/\n\nThere\u2019s also a gap to be filled at $12.60 from Nov. 3 2016. Current price while writing this is $6.46 and also showing small bullish divergence on the 4hr and 1hr RSI now. Anyways blah blah buy Fitbit calls I bought $4.5 6/26 calls I have no idea what I\u2019m doing so fuck it.
