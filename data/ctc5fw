As a former GE employee and as part of GE's famed audit staff I can tell you that Markopolos is on the right track. I have not yet studied the reports in detail but I can tell you one thing for sure - GE should never have been in the insurance business, there was NO ONE from GE that truly understood insurance. Mike Frazier who led the insurance businesses was Jack Welch's boy who knew how to play the GE game with great \"pitches\" and projections that would ultimately be met with accounting trickery and I am talking about the late 90's early 2000's. I remember going into the Virginia based insurance companies GE bought and the actuaries there were shocked that none of us had ANY prior experience in insurance and reinsurance (that was a Kansas based business). When shit would hit the fan GE would sell the businesses under the guise of \"we only want to be in #1 and #2 in a business\", however insurance/reinsurance and almost all GEC businesses were not as much part of the #1 and #2 scrutiny because of the financial juggling that could be done to boost earnings. In my opinion, the major culprits were Jack Welch and Dennis Dammerman, too bad Jeff Immelt and Keith Sherin and Jeff Bornstein had to try and get rid of the cocaine habit\"", "created_utc": 1566364063, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ctc5fw/long_ge_readcomment_found_on_sa/", "is_self": true}
