{"id": "cuhzae", "title": "This is the beginning of the end(ish). Super shitty DD inside.", "selftext": "Ok so I think today is the start of a down trend that may or may not turn into a total recession. My reasoning? Boomers. The boring kind.\n\nHear me out. We are basically dead center in the middle of retirement age for baby boomers. Meaning around half of them are in retirement and around half of them are planning on retiring in the next 5-10 years (I have no data to back this up). Which means there's A LOT of money in retirement accounts right now. Boomers have experienced three(?) recessions in their lives as adults, and know what happens to retirement accounts during them. This hasn't been THAT much of an issue until now, because there was always time to recover during the previous recessions. But now they're IN retirement. So if the economy starts heading south they are going to panic. And what do panic boomers love to do? Pull all of their money out of the market and buy gold (I'm literally basing this solely off of what my dad did in 2012).\n\nBetween the yield curves inverting, the trade-war only getting worse, and overall global economic sentiment decaying, paranoid boomers are going to start divesting in things they don't trust. Which is basically anything that they can't hold with their own two hands. So I think this is the time to not become bear gang, but gold gang. I don't believe in gold at all, and think it's value is only high for the same reason that bitcoin's value is high, but I know who has most of the money, and it's people that believe in gold. \n\nI think the black swan event is going to be trump announcing a capital gains tax cut, which he believes will make more people want to invest, but it will instead incentive boomers into pulling cash out and taking the now much lower taxes, assuming that they are beating the recession, and instead causing it to occur. Seeing the market tank, they'll buy gold, causing it to soar to ATH's. \n\n**TL;DR** Buy gold.", "created_utc": 1566585526, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cuhzae/this_is_the_beginning_of_the_endish_super_shitty/", "is_self": true}
