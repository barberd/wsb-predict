{"id": "fidhgj", "title": "Did AMC short itself?", "selftext": "LIMITING SEAT CAPACITY IN EVERY AMC AUDITORIUM\n\u2022  To give you more empty space around you within our theatres, we are capping ticket availability to 50% of the normal seating capacity for every showtime in every auditorium at all AMC theatres nationwide. Once we hit 50% of an auditorium\u2019s capacity, movie screenings will show as being Sold Out, even though by definition there will be a large number of unfilled seats. This will begin Saturday, March 14, and for now, will continue until April 30.\n\n\u2022  For those AMC auditoriums with more than 500 seats, we will further reduce bookings to a maximum of 250 people in any case.\n\n\u2022  And, it goes without saying that AMC is actively complying with all current and future federal, state and local authorities\u2019 directives on social gathering.", "created_utc": 1584162847.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fidhgj/did_amc_short_itself/", "is_self": true}
