Right now there's an uptrend on TSLA price action... but is it overbought?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[TSLA at close 4\\/15](https://preview.redd.it/tjscdnnxe3t41.png?width=1275&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec02d9ba135c6df7d07fc31194da4723fd0fecff)\n\nHere's TSLA at close today. According to what I know about MACD Histo and Stochastic D, a sell signal is generated when the streams cross. As you can see, the streams have crossed today, and also when the MACD histo reverses direction 7-10 days prior, it usually indicates coming price movement in the opposite direction. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[MACD Histo and Slow Stochastic D Indicators](https://preview.redd.it/plj1rvh2g3t41.png?width=1275&format=png&auto=webp&s=e036e9dcd698a5801e2f4a153a195dcd29459b84)\n\nFurthermore, looking at the last 8 months, stochastic D has done quite well in indicating directional changes (again, when the streams cross). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[3 sell indicators and 1 buy indicator for stochastic D](https://preview.redd.it/izgrxlarg3t41.png?width=1275&format=png&auto=webp&s=7019192540f2d5a113af022fbfe84bd38559144d)\n\nFinally, some hobo on the street once told me that you're only supposed to look at Japanese candlesticks alongside technical indicators as a filter. Let's take a look at the sticks...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Candle Pattern - Breakaway or Tower Top pattern](https://preview.redd.it/j0idbe6dh3t41.png?width=138&format=png&auto=webp&s=3be68e68c8a29293dbe8b00990a672a3fd72f046)\n\nI took a look here and had no fucking clue what I was looking at, so I asked Hiroshi, some random Japanese guy I knew, and he told me to fuck off. So, then I looked on google, and the closest thing I can match this to is either the breakaway or [tower top](https://www.feedroll.com/candlestick-patterns/1271-tower-top-pattern/) pattern.\n\nAll in all, this is all a bunch of bullshit, because TA is just hand waving and matching to pikachu shapes all invented by the Japanese, but all indicators point to a pretty big fall for TSLA in the next couple of days.\n\nBut then consider; how many people do you know who are in the market to buy a fucking Model Y in the next 3 months, and do you really think TSLA should be at 729 a share in the middle of a pandemic when nobody is actually even driving... and it's all starting to make sense. \n\nHere's a picture of my position:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0l7jcb3pi3t41.png?width=1041&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ef55567c2c328e6391784d0a9e90ce347e1b02d\n\nTL;DR - did a bunch of voodoo and the sticks told me to buy TSLA puts for tomorrow.", "created_utc": 1587006326.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g26v6c/what_i_learned_about_tsla_in_a_5_hour_technical/", "is_self": true}
