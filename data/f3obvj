Like fuck can you stop talking about tendies and actually make a bet? Take your TSLA, MSFT, and SPCE and go fuck yourself. \n\nThis sub is full of people who dont make any moves and just tail behind big pp autists with some coin from their trust fund or their 6figure8 salary. Actually learn to invest and make real mini-yolos and big uhoh-yolos till your credit is no mo' or you're riding to the moon and we can all tell you to go fuck yourself till we're right up there fucking ourselves with you. Pass the lube\n\nQuit echoing meme stocks please", "created_utc": 1581662521, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3obvj/intense_dd/", "is_self": true}
