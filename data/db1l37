{"id": "db1l37", "title": "Friday, September 27, 2019 Breakdown", "selftext": "I wanna break down Friday because it signals something for the following month. \n\nFriday was a crazy day, and I  called this earlier for a few reasons: The market is illiquid, the Trump impeachment and potentially the pending trade war(?). Today the market actually held up earlier- i think DOW opened up 150, but then tanked later in the day following the White House News about delisting Chinese stocks and blocking china investments. BABA actually tanked 7.3% for the day. \n\nThe markets moves today are setting up for the weeks to come, because it means that since the market reacted to the things in the first point, it means those will be affecting the longer run to come. So the market may potentially begin it's down-run. This feels like an interesting time to actually start watching the bond rates (TLT) and definitely Gold and Silver. \nThe white house deliberates on trying to limit US investments/financial interactions to China. \n Basically, The impeachment, the market Illiquidity and the trade war + this new news of Chinese Delisting and blockading was the \". And that the DOW moves up 150 points earlier in the day, and then actually turned around to being down 150- total down of 350 points. But the market is started to break out of the \"impeachment range\" area.\n\nRead this: \nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-27/white-house-weighs-limits-on-u-s-portfolio-flows-into-china-k12ahk4g\n\nthe article reads: \"delisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges and limiting Americans\u2019 exposure to the Chinese market through government pension funds.\" Which means they're trying to limit the overall exposure of US finances with China overall- likely as a threat(?). This idea isn't new because Marko Rubio and white house officials have been trying to establish this for a while. The interesting thing the article also says is that some of their economists claim that the US has \"an comparative advantage compared to china in provisioning financial services.\" This is really interesting because while the US has a comparative advantage to China in procuring financial services, that China could potentially have the absolute advantage in both. Meaning that while China has an absolute advantage in financial services, they also have an absolute adv. in whatever it is that it COSTS them. Meaning it could cost china more to participate, but still have technically more to offer than does the US. (This isn't true per say, I'm just playing around with the idea.) Anywho, while China has refused to give into any of the US' strong arm tactics, Trump is always trying to up the \"ante\". This will also be interesting to see on the how the Shanghai Composite reacts to this news (I'd assume poorly?).\nChina restricted limitations on US investments in China to bring in more investments. Jim Cramer loves. BABA has a huge market cap, but we will have to see what happens. The news isn't necessarily a negative signal just yet. But it can develop into one(?). And if so, BABA can be the move. 1.2 trillion dollars off the exchange, but not going to 0.The drop in BABA is important because this is correlated to the S&amp;P and DOW in that it pushes a lot of uncertainty into the market. So coincidentally, this all still falls into politics. The impeachment zone relative to the new strong arm tactics. The timing is ridiculous.\n\nWall street doesn't like this uncertainty, and this is gonna be a \"problem.\"  so I'll speculate that this means that this will likely drive people to jump from their stocks into something more stable and predictable.\n\nFarmers are gonna come @ Wall St. Some people speculate that China may dump treasuries - it's unlikely. \n\nOne more day of Sept. and this is getting very \"interesting\" as we head into October. What i mean by interesting is there are some very pivotal factors that are going to be guiding the market into October. We're back to August levels, but it's moving a bit slower- so prep different strategies. \nChinese Yuan is a divergence where it's weakening, most aren't noticing and its more than it was in August at our lows. Sunday night China might fix it- and however they do it will be a message to Wall St.\n \nTLDR: Tariff Man hates China and America hate Tariff Man which is bad for MU.", "created_utc": 1569792757, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/db1l37/friday_september_27_2019_breakdown/", "is_self": true}
