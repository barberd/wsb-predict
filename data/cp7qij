{"id": "cp7qij", "title": "Long WMGI. DD Inside", "selftext": "Wright Medical Group is a $3 billion dollar medical implant company based in Amsterdam.  Last week they beat earnings, but lowered guidance sending their stock spiraling down 22%.  See now what happened is they were selling their implants primarily through distributors with a small direct sales team to compliment.  Their distribution channels failed to deliver on Q2 sales projections for their big toe implant product called Cartiva and sales for that particular product dropped 40%.  What did Wright Medical do you ask?  They immediately pulled the plug on their distribution sales partners and are building up their direct sales force.  Now I've been part of a company in this industry that did this, and it was massively successful.  The challenge is you are basically directly competing with all of these distribution reps now, but the advantage is you have a more specialized and focused sales force.  The stock is trading at it's lowest point since May 2018.  Depending on how quickly they can ramp up this direct sales force, I'm betting this stock has seen it's floor and we'll see a nice climb back up to near $30 by year end.  Tomorrow morning I'm loading up on Feb 2020 $25 calls.  That is unless somebody on here can talk me out of it.", "created_utc": 1565585929, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cp7qij/long_wmgi_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
