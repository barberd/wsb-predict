{"id": "h7y1ou", "title": "Retard confession: bear to defensive bull", "selftext": "I was bag holding and averaging down SPY 6/29 292Ps for over a month and sold yesterday right before it fell off a cliff at 311. Left about $4k on the table. But that wasn't enough for my dumbass, so I put all that cash into 6/15 311Cs when SPY was at 310. I tried to average this down too. This lost me about $12k.\n\nAfter doing something stupid like this, I realized:\n\nFuck SPY\n\nI can't time for shit\n\nShorting SPY involves timing, cause stonks only go up in the long run. You have to buy puts near the top and close the puts before it starts to go up again.\n\nThe winning strategy for me is to be a defensive bull. Trust me when I say, I know all the gay bear thesis and have some of my own (CLO collapse, deflation, etc). What's the point though if I can't time for shit and the Fed probably only brought down the market to pressure Mitch and Trump to pass another stimulus?\n\nTherefore, here's what I bought yesterday/today and why:\n\nBRK.B 6/17/22 180C, 12/18/20 205C\n\nBerkshire is trading at book value, which is based on stock prices as of 3/30. This makes no fucking sense when the biggest holdings are Apple, Amazon, and cash. Plus most of their operating companies are monopoly like, which gives them earning power even in a depression. This is my biggest position by far.\n\nBB 7/17/20 6C, 1/21/22 7.5C\n\nBlackberry is now a software only company, but it's valued like a manufacturer. It's automotive software business will shrink this year, but it also is one of the largest names in cybersecurity.  It acquired Cylance two years ago and that part of the business is exploding right now. Cylance, if valued like it's competitor CRWD, would be worth 3x what Blackberry as a whole is worth.\n\nCCH/WS\n\nThis is a warrant for the SPAC for UTZ (the salty snack brand). It's good for four years with a strike of $11.50 on CCH. The stock is valuing the company at about $1.4B, which is below enterprise value.. for what's basically another Frito Lay with higher revenue growth and less debt. Also the investor presentation forecast seems really conservative. The CEO says sales increased substantially more than expected last quarter due to lockdowns.\n\nBHC 7/10/20 19.5C\n\nYes this is actually Valeant and they have a lot of debt. However, they rolled their debt and have zero payments until 2029. They are cash flow positive and will remain so for this year (one of the few companies to issue guidance). Their largest segment is OTC products from Bausch and Lomb. Short dated calls were cheap as shit.\n\nLAKE 7/17/20 25C\n\nBest for last. This company makes PPE. They doubled their revenue last quarter and income exploded, analyst expectations were crushed. Yet the stock is only up about 22% due to this crash. Options are not cheap, but the stock is trading at 50% off its 52 week high from before earnings.\n\nTL DR: I can't time puts for shit and the Fed probably only brought down the market to pressure Mitch and Trump to pass another stimulus. Scroll up for positions. \n\nThis is not investment advice, I'm clearly an idiot.", "created_utc": 1592012702.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h7y1ou/retard_confession_bear_to_defensive_bull/", "is_self": true}
