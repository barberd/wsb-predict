I fucking told you the ship was going down and this wasn\u2019t no goddamn flu man.\n\nI knew I should have bought my puts farther out. Why should I think the market would ever be rational?!\n\nArgh!!!\n\nMy $114 RCL puts expired fucking worthless recently, and now RCL is clipping $81 fucking dollars. And you guys are eating it up? I\u2019m going to lose my fucking mind. \n\nStill nursing 4/17 $40 FXI puts which I expect will print spectacularly.
