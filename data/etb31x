This company was started by the CEO's dad and then passed off to the boy genius when he got his shit together. They used to manufacture weapons but the CEO, Tony, is kinda eccentric but a great visionary with a lot of creativity. So Tony is overseas at the Monaco race and about to sit down to get brunch or something, when our boi Elon says 'wtf is up dude, I have this wicked awesome idea for an electric jet, want in on this action'? Tony is all in, like I said -- funding secured for $TSLA's electric jet a decade ago.\n\nThis documentary came out 10 years ago, and Elon already had the idea for this electric jet back then? Since that then we got cars and SUVs, now a cybertruck? We're going to the sky in electric jets soon, retards.
