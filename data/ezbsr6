{"id": "ezbsr6", "title": "PTON Subscriber Numbers", "selftext": "I've been a PTON cult member for years now but haven't taken before today. The bike itself shows a decent amount of user data, so I had the bright idea to try to back into sub numbers using the below calculations. Every number here is definite EXCEPT for my assumption for the rate of bikers signing up for the annual challenge (see below).\n\nBased on my calculations, plus anecdotal evidence of exponentially increased activity over the past few months on the official Facebook groups and in the live rides, I believe PTON will beat expectations. HOWEVER, I also believe they are fundamentally overvalued here (I know, who cares about that in wsb land).  Therefore, I am playing this by buying calls as a pure lotto play.  I will buy shares if the price drops after lockup period expires.\n\nIPO: 1.4M members / 511,202 subscribers = 2.74 members per sub\n\nQ1: 1.6M members / 562,774 subscribers = 2.84 members per sub\n\nQ2 projected : 680K-685K subs\n\nAs of today, there were 362,578 participants in the \"Annual Challenge\".  This is a challenge that not many people know about/sign up for. It's not worth much except if you are motivated by these types of things.   I believe the rate of members signing up for this challenge is about 15%.  \n\nSo... 362,578 / 15% = 2,417,187 members / 2.84 members per sub = 851,122 total subs vs 680K-685K projected.  Keep in mind: 1) my calculation is as of today, not as of the end of Q2, and 2) my 15% signup rate is a pure guess based on my PTON cult knowledge. Anyone else who owns a PTON can chime in with guesses about the challenge sign up rate.\n\nTl;dr - I expect PTON to beat subscriber estimates based on my shoddy calculations.
