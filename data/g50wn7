{"id": "g50wn7", "title": "Oil tankers?", "selftext": "With oil prices being at historic lows, what\u2019s your opinion on oil tankers like STNG? Surely many people are going to take advantage of oil being negative and start storing them. That\u2019s why STNG is up 18% today. I don\u2019t see states opening up within the next few months so there\u2019s a high chance we\u2019re going to see negative prices again next month. With STNG being up today, is it too late to get in on the action?", "created_utc": 1587415588.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g50wn7/oil_tankers/", "is_self": true}
