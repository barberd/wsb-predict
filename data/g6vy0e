The Mines can\u2019t produce gold and other minerals and there stock has dropped. Simple.\n\nThis has effectively halted the gold supply coming from all over North America. Many mines will begin to resume operations in the next month (see above link), coinciding with a fairly predictable increase in gold prices.\n\nDo the math.  CDE is at a 3 year low, coinciding with a global drop in gold prices and exacerbated by COVID. The price of CDE when gold was at $1700/oz was $15, and is currently at $3.50.\n\nThis companies mines (and others I\u2019m sure) are slowly re-opening, and gold will likely be increasing in price. Seems like a good reason to be bullish.\n\nAny reasons to call bullshit on any of these arguments?\n\nTL:DR \u2014-> Buy CDE $10c 1/15/21", "created_utc": 1587679293.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6vy0e/north_american_gold_mines_coeur_hecla_etc/", "is_self": true}
