{"id": "g2uj7j", "title": "Noob question with selling options", "selftext": " Hello  all, question regarding a vertical spread. This was my first time doing  a vertical spread, and first time selling an option. I did it as a  learning opportunity. Here is the position:\n\n\n\nATVI May 1 long call @ 60. Got in at $2.63, its now at $8.45\n\nATVI May 1 short call @ 63.5. Got in at $1.5, now its at $5.4.\n\n\n\nI  wanted to do a play for earnings, and usually I do just a naked call  but I wanted to learn how to do a vertical spread. I read everywhere  taht with a debit spread like this, I could hedge against risk and limit  my losses. So now it turns out my long call is ITM, but so is my short.  What are my options here? Right now, ToS is telling me the spread is in  the hole for about 52$. Should I keep it? Should I close my short?\n\n\n\nAnother  question, if the buyer of my short decides to exercise, I would be  forced to exercise my call right? and I would essentially make a loss  b/c this was a debit spread? Forgive me, I am very new to this but I am  trying my best to learn.
