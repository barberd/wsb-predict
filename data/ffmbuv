I apologize for the formatting earlier, but I figured it out. \n\nAnyway, I tried day trading but i lost about 2k from TSLA stock, so i switched over to calls/puts and have been going through this sub the past week. I need your intelligent minds to help me spread out my money on different companies. I have almost 9k, 10k if i do RH instant deposit. Im not asking you to do my hw for me but i am asking for assistance. Based on what ive read this weekend, these are the plays that makes sense to me.\n\nTicker|Strike|Qty|Price|Total|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--\nDKS|$40 Call 3/13|20|0.30|600|\nXOM | $40 Put 3/13 | 20 | 0.35 | 700\nRDSA | $40 Put 3/13 | 10 | 0.90 | 900\nXOP  | $8 Put 3/13 | 200 | 0.02 | 400\nMRO | $5 Put 3/13 | 100 | 0.06 | 600\nCCL | $25 Put 3/13 | 10 | 1.05 |1050\nWYNN | $91 Put 3/13 | 5 | 3.95 | 1975\nHTZ |$7.5 Put 3/13 | 20 |0.45 | 900\nDG | $182.5 Call 3/20 | 10 | 0.50 | 500\nSJM |$115 Call 3/20 | 10 | 1.20 | 1200\nUBER | $28 Put 3/20 |10 | 0.73 | 730\nEWI | $26 Call 3/20 | 5 | 1.15 | 575\nWTI | $2 Put 3/20 | 20 | 0.20 | 400\nCAR | $19 Put 3/20 | 10 | 0.80 | 800\nVAL | $1 Put 3/20 | 100  |0.05 | 500\nDO | $1 Put 3/20 | 100 | 0.05 | 500\nRIG | $1 Put 3/20 | 100  |0.03 | 300\nXOP | $8 Put 3/20 | 0\nRUN | $24 Call 3/20 | 50 | 0.15 | 750\nRUN | $25 Call 3/20 | 100 |0.10 | 1000\nDIS | $100 Put 3/20 | 5 | 1.19 | 595\nABBV | $92 Call 3/20 | 5 | 1.43 | 715\nINO | $6 Put 3/20 |10 | 0.45 | 450\nAAL | $10 Put 4/3 | 10 | 0.63 | 630\nINDA | $29.5 Put 4/9 | 10  | 0.75 | 750\nGIS | $60 Call 4/17 | 10 | 0.71 | 710\nINDA | $27 Put 4/24 | 20 | 0.40  |800\nPK | $12.5 Put 4/17 | 10 | 0.45 | 450\nUVXY | $15 Put 4/24 |10 | 0.74 | 740\nSBUX | $67.5 Put 5/15 | 5 | 2.44 | 1220\nLVS | $40 Put 5/15 | 5 | 1.78 | 890\nLH | $220 Call 5/15 | 5 | 1.8 | 900\nLVS | $40 Put 6/19 | 5 | 2.43 | 1215\nGIS | $65 Call 7/17 | 20 | 0.46 | 920\nF | $5 Put 9/18 | 20 | 0.36 | 720\nPG | $140 Call 1/15 | 5 | 3.2 |1600\n | | |Total|27685\n\nTotal is 27k, so that wont work.

Should i stick to oil puts instead?", "created_utc": 1583714754, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffmbuv/putcall_assitance_for_tommorow_pls/", "is_self": true}
