I have a long position in VMW.\n\n**TLDR: VMW June 19 150C**\n\nVMWare's earnings are May 28, which leaves some decent runway left to play the IV increase leading into earnings, but you don't want anything expiring too close to earnings, since theta will steal your premium. Expiring two weeks after earnings is usually a fine distance that protects gains, but you probably want to consider selling the day (or two) before earnings if we  had already run up to 150 quickly.\n\nSo, onto the actual DD. First, from a personal standpoint, as a cloud developer, there is no cloud without virtual machines, as they are an essential component to scalable architecture (and building your application to scale with user growth is basically the original point of cloud based technology). And without VMWare, the landscape of potential VM options significantly diminishes.\n\nIf the cloud is the gold mine, VMWare are selling the very best virtualized shovels. Shit, they can just spin up new shovels at a keystroke.\n\nVMWare is at the core of any sound cloud strategy, and Google has recently announced their fully-managed VMware Cloud Foundation stack on dedicated Google infrastructure:\n\n[https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-announces-new-integrated-first-party-offering-with-vmware/](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-announces-new-integrated-first-party-offering-with-vmware/)\n\nAlso, VMWare's relevance in the context of COVID-19, and partnerships with Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are highlighted in this recent Business Insider article, which is pay-to-read, so I've copied it here, since I'm no elitist:\n\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/vmwares-coo-the-indispensable-bridge-in-the-cloud-2020-5](https://www.businessinsider.com/vmwares-coo-the-indispensable-bridge-in-the-cloud-2020-5)\n\n>VMware Chief Operating Officer Sanjay Poonen said the alliances it forged with cloud giants like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have transformed the company into an \"indispensable bridge.\" VMware's virtualization technology has become a critical tool in the cloud as businesses set up networks on multiple platforms and in their own data centers. \"If you look at the last two to three years, we're the only company where the six public-cloud-infrastructure leaders have all embraced VMware,\" Poonen told Business Insider. \"Nobody else has that position of being the indispensable bridge from the private cloud to the public cloud.\"\n>\n>The earnings reports from several tech giants \u2014 Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, and Google \u2014 are in, and they underscore a key trend: The cloud is hot.\n>\n>VMware Chief Operating Officer Sanjay Poonen, who has been keeping track of the reports, said he noted another common theme in these cloud giants' success.\n>\n>\"They've all embraced us,\" he told Business Insider last week. \"Some percentage of those companies' revenue growth will come from VMware helping customers.\"\n>\n>How did all the big cloud companies become VMware allies?\n>\n>The Dell Technologies subsidiary blazed the trail for virtualization, a technology that enables businesses to access disparate computer systems as one network. Virtualization has become even more critical in the cloud because it allows businesses to set up networks on web-based platforms and scale down \u2014 or even abandon \u2014 private data centers.\n>\n>A new trend called \"hybrid cloud,\" where businesses use multiple cloud platforms and in-house data centers, has made VMware even more popular, since its software makes it possible to manage data and applications across platforms. As a result, all the major cloud players (including China's Alibaba) have sought out an alliance with VMware.\n>\n>\"If you look at the last two to three years, we're the only company the six public-cloud-infrastructure leaders have all embraced,\" Poonen said. \"Nobody else has that position of being the indispensable bridge from the private cloud to the public cloud. We view Amazon, Azure, Google as our friends. We've worked really hard the last three years to build pristine partnerships with all of them.\"\n>\n>Some of VMware's friendships have even risen eyebrows. The most prominent example is Oracle: The two companies had long been rivals, with Oracle refusing to support VMware's software for years \u2014 until it announced an unexpected new alliance last year. VMware Chief Information Officer Bask Iyer told Business Insider at the time that he was \"very pleasantly surprised\" by Oracle's decision to form a partnership.\n>\n>The COVID-19 crisis has led to a faster acceleration of the cloud as businesses scramble to adapt to the sudden pivot to remote work. VMware is well-positioned to benefit because of the alliances it forged in the past few years, according to Poonen: \"The notion of VMware being at the center of the cloud for the enterprise is only going to get more and more pronounced,\" he said.\n\n**TLDR: VMW June 19 150C**\n\nSecure those virtualized tendies.", "created_utc": 1589827330.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gm7dgy/vmware_vmw_the_indispensable_bridge_in_the_cloud/", "is_self": true}
