{"id": "dutrrb", "title": "Why are microcap/nanocap stocks more risky than blue chip options?", "selftext": "One of the rules here is \"Avoid microcap / OTC / crypto discussion.\"  Now OTC avoidance should be obvious, crypto is still too new to make any decent predictions without a ton of subject knowledge, but why microcaps?  Like options, they can swing 30% one way or the other in a day.  And certainly not all have very good average volume, but it seems to me a microcap/nanocap trading 100K volume shares a day is inherently less risky than some AMD calls with only 1K volume a day (praise Su Bae).  The options also expire whereas microcap shares do not inherently decay with time (though certainly you could wind up bag-holding for some worthless company).  Surely there's some money to be made there with a similar amount of risk to options?
