It's meant to tell us the least retarded momentum on the market at the most undervalued prices, usually good for at least a week.\n\nMy +13% came on Monday before I made my post, then on Tuesday retard bot started yelling at me bc it's fail-stops were triggering with SPY crashing. Once the bot gets profit it gets greedy and its failstops trigger faster than -20%. But instead of letting Retard Bot buy those positions on my API broker, I did it the true retard way on RH.\n\nDo you think I sold at the failstop notifications like a savvy investor recieving superhuman advice? Fuck no. I told Retard Bot fuck off, a retard captain goes down with his ship. I held through Tuesday at a 20% loss.\n\nThen I figured fuck it, I cant call myself a  \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc3b  until I buy SPY puts. I YOLOd SPY puts and VXX calls at the bottom. Then it went back to green and I lost 40% since Im day trade restricted. Then it went back to shit and I made net 15% gainz.\n\nSo retard bot did pretty good for a steaming pile of shit JavaScript program I wrote in 3 weeks. It does not only take positions on Monday anymore btw, because since the market is stagnating and less predictable I need the fucker to be more selective and reactive throughout the week for my 25% weekly goal. it waits for less retarded opportunities throughout the week and cherry picks, but I will continue to publish its top picks on Mondays. I have a 12 hour shift Sunday night so you guys might not get a post till monday evening, idk.", "created_utc": 1589570528.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gkfmp2/5k_to_1_mil_retard_bot_week_1_results_13/", "is_self": true}
