China has extended the shutdown of their factories by another week and this will not. Corona virus has shut down all of the street traffic in Wuhan and many other parts of China out of fear. Corona virus also has the ability to live on plastics (or any material) for 28 days. If they open factories back up and sick people are working, they will essentially be shipping the virus world wide...\n\nApple has shut down stores and 1/5 of their revenue comes from China. They also produce their new iPhones at this time of the year. Any delay now will just result in a delay later. This will slowdown the rollout of 5g.\n\nAlso, imagine those who have loans for their businesses. They aren't making any money and won't be for who knows how long what happens to the credit market in China?\n\nONE BY ONE PEOPLE WILL START TO THINK OF THESE THINGS AND MUCH PROFITS WILL BE MADE, CHEERS DEGENS", "created_utc": 1581277066, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f1drbd/corona_virus_threat_downplayed_much_profits/", "is_self": true}
