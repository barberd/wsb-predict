{"id": "f9ub92", "title": "KSS earnings play", "selftext": "Alright guys here's my plan - Kohl\u2019s Corporation ($KSS) releases their earnings on 3/3. Over the past year Kohl\u2019s has consistently fucked themselves over at earnings, with the stock following suit. For instance, their earning report on 5/21/2019 had a -8.96% surprise which led to the stock falling 18%, 8/20/2019 with a +1.97% surprise but still dropped 5%, and 11/19/2019 had a surprise of -12.94% which had the stock fall 17% the next day. This earnings report is posed to be down 12% from the same time last year and shows no reason to successfully make it\u2019s estimated target, leading me to believe that the stock price will fall somewhere between 15-20%. \n\nKnowing this, it seems reasonable that the amount of puts that will be bought are going to rise sometime within the week and when I check some of them are still dirt cheap (i.e. 3/6 $37 puts are only worth $0.6 at the time of writing). This put, while it seems far off of the current $KSS value of $41.12 per share, is totally feasible to achieve within the designated timespan. If you want a bit more of a safety net (which you shouldn\u2019t need really), the 3/13 $37 put is only slightly higher at $.75. The required amount to get to $37 is only a 10.11% drop from the current value.\n\nThis 10.11% needed drop is far below my predicted 15% estimate, and that is on the conservative end of my projection.\n\nIf none of that convinces you consider that all of their competition (Dillards, Bed Baths and Beyond, Macy\u2019s have been on the decline for over a year now, with no real end in sight. These chain-stores\u2019 revenues continue to drop over time and with beer virus fears on the rise no sector is safe - rip my AMD calls :(\n\n\nTl/Dr:\n\nBuy 3/6 sub-$40 KSS Puts for (practically) GUARANTEED $$$\n\nI\u2019m going to be selling off like literally everything I have tomorrow and going into KSS (besides from my CROX puts lmao i\u2019m keeping those)", "created_utc": 1582728582, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9ub92/kss_earnings_play/", "is_self": true}
