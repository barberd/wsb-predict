Generally, it will take 10-15 business days for the lawyers of the transfer agent + fund to give these shares the okay to be transferred to your brokerage account. \n\nBe honest folks. This company has a great video client. That's really it. There were other companies that had a great easy copy-able shtick. Groupon? Remember when that little shit pranced around at 240 dollars? Snap? Netscape? Barnes/nobles? \n\nOther platforms are going to say, \"nice job! Hope you can find some other way to make money because we're going to offer your premium product for free!\"\n\nIf you were an investor who just received brand spanking new stock? Your costbasis at 5 dollars or w/e. Your capital gains worries set at 15% already. Why the hell wouldn't you sell/dump?\n\nTL:DR:\nBest guesstimate is 3-6 million(don't know what the exact distribution between lp is exactly) new shares will be sold by 'unaffilliated' limited partners within the next 10-15 days. If you are holding a long position, you might want to consider getting out. Shorts? Get ready. Not a financial advisor do your homework. \n\nPositions: 10P Jul 24 227.5 strikes. Umm also, this is a virus stock, thus it has more retard strength than your average stock...
