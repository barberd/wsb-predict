{"id": "gr1rwu", "title": "Daily swing trade videos", "selftext": "Been watching a guy on youtube - publishes his swing trades daily ---  after markets close.  He always buys at close of market, sells next day close of market, always $25k split between usually 5 stocks each day.  All look like pretty good picks usually, been watching for weeks.  Is there any way to get such picks in advance, before markets close, from this or any other reasonably successful trader?  EDIT: Here's the link of the videos, wasn't posted initially because I didn't want to be promoting anything...
