I've added a few recommendations for earnings after spending most of Friday and Saturday doing DD for next week.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHey y'all! As usual, been swamped with work and research.  Stock picks for last week (and the week before!) were absolute fire. Let's keep it rollin'.  I've received tons of private messages asking for advise, justifications for stock picks, etc. I will try to get to you as soon as I can, but I'm generally much better at replying to the post directly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI usually post (about 20-25) stock picks in the Daily Discussion thread but I do so at very odd hours (usually late at night and on weekends) as I'm swamped with work at more regular hours. My stock recommendations usually rely on in-depth TA and FA, which take some time. I will try posting in the front page more often in the hopes of more tists getting a chance to see the DD. And I will continue with the tradition of posting results for the sake of accountability.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs usual, I'll recommend puts and calls, and given the positive feedback and success from this weeks' earnings plays, I've devoted some extra time into DD for earnings next week.   \n\n\n*FOR THE BULLS:*\n\n* Calls: $**TWLO,** $**VRTU**, $**EBAY**, $**COF**, $**FDX**, $**XLNX**, $**OKTA**, $**LULU**, should print good tendies\n* BULLISH POWER PLAYS\\*\\*: $**UBER**, $**SQ**, $**TRIP, $CRWD, $FVRR**\n   * If you get CRWD calls, wait for a day or two - at least wait til market close on Monday. The stock will likely pull back some, but after that it will continue its voyage to the moon\n\n*FOR THE BEARS:*\n\n* For the bears: $**MTCH**, $**IBKR**, $**GRUB**, $**SKX**, $**AMBA**\n* BEARISH POWER PLAY\\*\\*:  $**BIDU,** (buy late Monday or Tuesday), **$CMG** (sell before earnings for safe play, sell after earnings if you want to yolo NFLX style); **$HSY** (sell before earnings)\n\n*EARNINGS*:\n\n* EARNINGS CALLS: $**BIIB; $GOOGL; $PYPL;** $**FB** (easy peasy, though I would buy on Tuesday at market open); \n* EARNINGS PUTS: $**HLT;** $**BA** (don't buy tomorrow. Buy right before earnings), \n\n*For the broke breddas:*\n\n* Penny stock of the week: $**OTLK**\n\n\\*\\*Power plays, in my books, are riskier/less certain plays with potential to print plenty more $. Buy at your own risk, of course.\n\nY'all have a great trading week ahead, and thanks for the kind words!
