I got:\n\n\\-3 AUPH Call options EXP 1/17.2020 EXP Strike: $10\n\n\\-10 AUPH call options EXP 12/20  Strike: $7.5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQUESTION IS: If I exercise the call options, wouldn't it be better tax-wise if I hold onto the shares into January? I paid $1888 for the 12/20 $7.5 calls. I am not sure how this all works though tax-wise. I would rather not pay tax until 2021 on this", "created_utc": 1575516426, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e6b6bl/tax_question/", "is_self": true}
