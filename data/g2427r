I'm not sure wtf to do with it, the possibilities seem endless. \nTo be honest I wish I had received nothing. My guess is that 2-3 times that was spent on getting those funds into my checking account. Are lives being taken care of by those receiving the full check? How many bills are you paying, how many months of mortgage will it cover? \n\nThis is what CNBC put up today:\n\nFood 16% \nYou're probably laid off or furloughed, why the fuck are you ordering out? You fat fuck.\n\nMoney transfers 14%\nWhy? Where? Wtf. \n\nGas 10% \nNo one is driving!!!! How the shit are you spending it on gas? (And why the hell are my USO calls assfucking me)\n\nGrocery store 9%\nThis % should be much higher considering you have so much time at home to cook.\n\nATM withdrawals 9%\nWhere are you spending cash that isn't in the above categories? \n\nVideo games 5%\nFucking games? FUCKING GAMES!!!\n\nBill pay 4%\nFuck water and electric, who needs it. \n\nAnd to cap it all off (if you didn't notice) this is no where near 100%. CNBC strikes again.\n\nMe.... I'm going to YOLO it all on SPY puts, or calls. Fuck I have no idea what's it's going to do.", "created_utc": 1586995610.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2427r/stimulus_checks_went_out_today/", "is_self": true}
