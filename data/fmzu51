{"id": "fmzu51", "title": "Incoming Bounce & Vix Puts", "selftext": "Good morning fucktards (and my roommate who now stalks me on here cause i wont tell her my plays anymore),\n\nTLDR: I never provide strike and date/positions until after my gains/losses because I'm not a fucking enabler. VIX support looks to be around 49.5-55. If you aren't as stupid as you look you can pause pornhub for five seconds and figure the rest out from there. \n\nHope everybody did their own DD after I tipped you off on my VIX play and made some hot tendies. \n\nFirst things first, we didn't quite hit 220 be EOW (228 but fuck you I was pretty close and I didn't promise shit.)\n\nWell now i'm setting up my next play and it looks like atleast two of you shit-sticks aren't completely autistic  cause you both beat me to the fucking punch. Shout out to u/bigd0g111 and u/Variation-Seperate for basically saying what I am about to say with different DD and logic.\n\n[https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix](https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix) So DPI started to sky rocket. I don't necessarily think we have bottomed yet, but we are getting close. If any of you retards watch the time&sales they would see big fucking orders flying around everywhere like granny titties which i see as big players positioning themselves for the rebound. (so i don't have access to historical data only realtime so i forgot to screenshot, take my word for it or don't IDGAF.).\n\nMonthly:[https://www.tradingview.com/x/PVvINzLd/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/PVvINzLd/)\n\nWe are fast approaching 30 on RSI which will be supported. I have always believed 210 was our temporary support/bottom and I will look to taking my position there. However it is entirely possible that we don't quite get that low. If we bounce extremely hard (very possible with how gamma is positioned) I believe we will top out at 2825ish. \n\nDaily: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/G5Zy9GtC/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/G5Zy9GtC/)\n\nYou can see the Kijun-sen line i am targeting as the top. I am also a strong believer that volume is the best thing to watch in these falling knife situations. they will disclose where the big players have offloaded/taken their positions. If you notice the February 28th day that i have marked you can see how i predicted the last temporary bottom. Abnormal volume. Notice it doesn't have to be extremely large, it could also be very very low (indicating selling pressure has dryed up like your gf vag when you around).\n\nNow if you're retarded you are seeing this as an opportunity to long SPY or whatever the fuck when volatility is so goddamn high that you will get ass fucked. I have been exclusively trading the VIX during this past month which comes with its own dangers (euro options not American) but the bright side is i find the puts somewhat cheap (calls are very much not). So if i have to spell it out for you, buy VIX puts when we bottom to around 210. \n\nVIX: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/b5YGUBHz/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/b5YGUBHz/)\n\nI expect VIX to be swinging quite wildly for the next couple weeks. I see 49.5-55 as the support (and i am favoring the lower end of that range). As it rises to 85+ Ill be looking at cheap puts. Ride the (sex) swings faggot. \n\nAlot of you eager beavers have been messaging me nonstop with questions. So to alleviate some of that shit i am going to write it out here. \n\n* I recommend \"reminisces of a stock operator\" discussing Jesse Livermore's life and John Murphy's \"Technical Analysis of the Futures Market\".\n* I am not your fucking financial advisor so don't ask me what the fuck you should do.\n* Stop fucking messaging me \"Do YoU sTiLl ThInK .....\" Yes fucker. I still do if i posted it. Unless i post otherwise fuck off...\n* WhAt Is YoUr NeXt PlAy? Maybe if you did your own DD and stopped believing shit like Quad Witch BS then you wouldn't keep losing your parents allowance you fucking cuck.\n\nOTHER than that if you have legit questions about TA etc. I am always happy to help (ya filthy retards). \n\nDo your own DD and don't take positions off random ppl on the internet (stranger danger). \n\nGL", "created_utc": 1584883111.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmzu51/incoming_bounce_vix_puts/", "is_self": true}
