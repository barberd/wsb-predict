DO NOT buy the 5/15 calls like I know some of you inevitably will.\n\nThis will be somewhat long so move on if you can't spare the few minutes.\n\nIf you believe that ticker symbol matters than we got the best one right here, who doesn't like a nice BJ (from your wife's bf of course).  I had this play in front of my face and just realized it like the dumbass I am but I'm in it now.  I paid near or at the ask today to get in because bidding at the bid wasn't doing anything.  Here's my skin in the game:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m3qnkjg1isy41.jpg?width=921&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d51718c82134b0f33060d84c37b6c73043172866\n\nThere's 3 parts to why I think BJs could have a blowout quarter.\n\n1.  My personal experience\n2. How BJs drives their margins\n3. Don't fight the (Google) trend\n\nUnlike you retards I wanted to avoid catching covid so I decided to (for the first time) have groceries delivered to us.  There's two grocery stores in this area, BJs and Stop&Shop.  Stop & Shop has Peapod handle their deliveries and you can get a free 60 day trial (why this is important will come into play).  \n\nFirst I drove to BJs late at night in March because I wanted to sneak in during a slow time when the covid zombies weren't there sneezing and touching everything.  Went at 7PM on a weekday which is normally dead and the parking lot was packed.  Went back the next night and again it was packed.  Wasn't happening, so I called them up to ask about their order online and pickup option.  They'll pack everything up for you but you need to come into the store and checkout, and oh by the way there was a few day wait for this option because they were backed up.  I wasn't stepping into the store so I turned to my last option, delivery via Instacart.  I placed my order and the delivery date kept getting pushed back... and back.... and back.... it took over two weeks to get my groceries.  I'm confident the backlog was due to BJs demand because as mentioned Peapod offers free delivery trial for 2 months so who would use Instacart and pay their fees when you can get free delivery.  \n\nHere's my two orders so far.  The \"order placed\" date is the date when you last tweaked your order.  That March 28th order was actually originally placed two weeks earlier and since it kept getting delayed we kept adding to the order.  Same shit happened in April as well.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k0qrqtewnsy41.jpg?width=1341&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e25050885b935f973705b64c8d5df25c01aab150\n\nWhen the groceries finally got delivered there was a ton of shit that was sold out completely and there was no reasonable substitute and there was a ton of shit that was sold out but there was a reasonable substitute.  From my March receipt:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[20 Items completely sold out, no substitute](https://preview.redd.it/3jsfb7vdosy41.jpg?width=429&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4e3ac80b573943e09ff2c03c3e81d7a09875bf45)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[There were 15 items \\(couldn't all fit in screenshot\\) that were replaced](https://preview.redd.it/quul3s0gosy41.jpg?width=420&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=077f4b45edeca12fdfd96554e50a7ebba3ea26ac)\n\nBJs is like Costco in case you don't have one around.  They have shit on pallets up 50 feet high.  If that was all sold out they drove huge Q1 sales numbers and Q2 is probably looking pretty damn good.   They also have their own in-store brand like Costco has Kirkland which have great margins for them and was all sold out.  \n\nBJs biggest margin drive is membership fees.  From their last quarterly earnings:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d0m36h9bpsy41.jpg?width=795&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4891d0fb65ad218e103db7b6cef77ed07e1afdec\n\nWith unemployment people need to save money and the membership fee is more then offset by the savings you get by buying in bulk.  Also, a pandemic kind of makes people want to stock up, and those people need memberships.  Don't take my word on it, let's see what people were searching for:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jc2ctf0npsy41.jpg?width=1191&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=29020f7b1ecd22af777de1fc59f6fdd7ceea1f7a\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dq9cul6opsy41.jpg?width=1190&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fd0c1496d6e9f4fbc296d926c01acf912541dac7\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/99g7s4ippsy41.jpg?width=1191&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7fb5a19b4d081ef1eb90690bf6896af006ea266e\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1dj7mmdqpsy41.jpg?width=1218&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=696febe1b19249a9b4cecd88f75cea47b194ed75\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm expecting their membership to have their biggest jump ever.  And once you sign up and pay the membership fee up front you are a member for a year so they'll be getting that incremental ongoing revenue every month.\n\nThis is an older article but the point is still valid, BJs has better pricing than Costco.  BJs also allows people to use manufacturer coupons and Costco does not.  The thrifty shoppers you'd expect with higher unemployment will know this and it will tilt them to BJs (if they have a choice in their area)\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/24/we-compared-bjs-and-costco-to-see-which-has-better-online-prices.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/24/we-compared-bjs-and-costco-to-see-which-has-better-online-prices.html)\n\nTaking a look at some numbers, BJs market cap is $4B.  Costco's is $132B.  BJs P/E ratio is 50% less than Costco's.  If they are able to get a huge jump in memberships, revenue, and earnings this quarter and a great forecast for rest of year I believe the P/E ratio will move towards Costco's.  They are underperforming and I think this will be their wake up quarter.  When the market has dipped the past two days look at what BJs did...  they dipped from the daily gain they were sitting at but they never really went below the previous day's closing price.  There is a lot of strength in that.  Do your own DD but I've put my money where my mouth is and I believe we will see an earnings beat, upward revised guidance, and continued strength in the stock after earnings (similar to how CHGG beat, gained, and has continued the upward trajectory).  Good luck, see you on the other side.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fr99f3ijpsy41.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c6d16fe16367073a9866fea5cf84b5a1b4aaad07", "created_utc": 1589491091.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gjvb46/dd_why_i_believe_bj_is_in_for_a_blowout_earnings/", "is_self": true}
