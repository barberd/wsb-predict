I've made $600 so far trading my student loan money (JK i  actually made $900 but I lost $300 on some really retarded shit but I **do** know the difference between a put and a call option so far so I am learning). Anyways, I think the mods have released me from my one month ban in purgatory, so I will share some lessons I've learned while investing autsitcally: \n\n1) I learned what a put option is - a put option means you put your money in the toilet and flush it. I bought $15 put options for $SPCE and it did not work out. Fuck the gay bears and the gay mods, the bull market will LAST FOREVER. \n\n2) Don't invest all of your student loan money in Dogecoin. I lost like $150 which could have bought a bunch of tendies. Stock options &gt; crypto because when you trade crypto you can lose half of your money but when you trade options you lose all your money and I've never been a glass half full kind of guy. Lao Tzu, Daoism's daddy, said that a bowl is most useful only when it's empty and my bank account is about to be the biggest bowl ever. I want to smoke the biggest bowl ever. \n\n3) I am currently all in on $CRM. While $AAPL is getting fucked by the CORONAVIRUS, and my wife is geting fucked by her boyfriend, SALESFORCE is a buy. They are releasing their earnings on Tuesday, and when they outperform, all of my money, which is invested in $CRM stock or $CRM call options, will go to the moon and I can buy so many tendies. SOFTWARE is immune to the coronavirus and software makes my soft 1 inch pp turn into a HARD 2 incher. I'm thinking I'm going to buy a plane ticket to vegas so I can make it rain after SALESFORCE prints me money. \n\n4) GOD BLESS AMERICA. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE STUDENT LOAN MONEY, UNCLE SAM, IT WILL TURN ME INTO A MILLIONAIRE!", "created_utc": 1582413883, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f80sbw/trading_student_loan_money_for_tendies_an_update/", "is_self": true}
