(amen) \n\nThis week we will be reading a passage from AnalFarmer 4:20 - \u201cand on the seventh day, the chosen one proclaimed \u201cGUH.\u201d \n\nPowerful powerful words. So let us repent from our gay ass positions so we too may avoid the greed that overcame AnalFarmer and consumed him. \n\nLet us also remember 1R0NYMAN, whose faith lifted him to new levels of autism not seen before. If you open your WSBIBLE to 1R0NYMAN 6:9 we read his prophecy to the righteous - \u201cit literally can\u2019t go tits up.\u201d \n\nTruly retarded, brothers. Truly retarded indeed. \n\nAnd let us not forget WSBgod, the anointed one. The Way! The only begotten son... of a bitch who came back from the dead with an another four million dollars goOD GOD DAMN! WHOOO! HELL YEAH! ... sorry brothers, the spirit comes over me when I ponder over these levels of autism. I can\u2019t help but get autisticly aroused. \n\nSo before we enter the trading week, let us pray \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\n\nOur father, you mysterious entity who controls the market...\nWe ask you to blesss our tendies and look over your children, especially the retards. We ask that you banish noobs to r/investing and help these stonks drop their fat asses for a real one. In the gay ass mods names we pray\n\n... #Amen.", "created_utc": 1581266308, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f1b2ox/welcome_to_wsb_sunday_service/", "is_self": true}
