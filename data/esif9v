{"id": "esif9v", "title": "DD: Wuhan Coronovirus ($APT, $MMM, $LAKE?)", "selftext": "$APT makes protective equipment and tends to do well in outbreaks. It shot up yesterday, but pulled back a bit today (nice for an entry).\n\n$MMM makes masks that get sold in large numbers during wildfires and outbreaks, but might be too diversified to be affected too heavily.\n\nA 2 to 5 percent mortality is quite high (normal flu is an order of magnitude or more below that). I wouldn't read too much into the patient profiles of the deceased yet; the fact that it has primarily affected 40 to 70 year olds to this point is too be expected (it's basically the demographic that frequents livestock markets). Unclear how the virus affects healthy/younger patients, but pneumonia doesn't need to kill to cause chronic problems.\n\nIf you were around for SARS last time around, you'd remember that fear of SARS meant that virtually everyone walking around Hong Kong, taiwan, etc. all had masks. During the 2014 Ebola outbreak, mask sales added nearly $30M to $MMM's revenue in Q4 (of course, $MMM just made $31.97B in total revenue (ttm), so that's not the biggest dent).\n\nOf note, my relatives are worried and starting to cancel flights to Asia in March and beyond. With new cases in Russia, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan (which China just blocked from the WHO conference), and the US, confirmed human to human transmission, and hundreds of millions about to travel and congregate in large groups for the lunar new year (China estimates 3 billion trips), this should take a few months to play out (SARS went for months, and everyone wore masks for at least a year). Longer term calls, or just buying and holding (also $LAKE, but I haven't been following) recommended.", "created_utc": 1579728062, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/esif9v/dd_wuhan_coronovirus_apt_mmm_lake/", "is_self": true}
