If they also get the JEDI deal ($10 fucking billion. imagine that), I think that'll be enough to offset the losses from personal computing (assuming it drops 3-6%) and they'll just reinvest the money in growing other segments.\n\nTLDR: MSFT TENDIES COMING SOON. $210c 5/15 and $185 5/15", "created_utc": 1582757419, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fa1xro/dd_on_msft_fuck_not_meeting_guidance_fuck_bezos/", "is_self": true}
