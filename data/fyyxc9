{"id": "fyyxc9", "title": "What if we just start our own Federal Reserve Bank?", "selftext": "I was doing some DD and came across these 2 legal cases:  \n\n\n In *United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation v. Western Union Telegraph Co.*,[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank#cite_note-5) the U.S. Supreme Court stated, \"Instrumentalities like the national banks or the federal reserve banks, in which there are private interests, are not departments of the government. They are private corporations in which the government has an interest.\" \n\nand\n\n In *Lewis v. United States*,[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank#cite_note-Lewis-vs-U.S.-7) the [United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Ninth_Circuit) stated that: \"The Reserve Banks are not federal instrumentalities for purposes of the FTCA \\[the [Federal Tort Claims Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Tort_Claims_Act)\\], but are independent, privately owned and locally controlled corporations.\"   \n\n\nSo since the Federal Reserve is a private corporation and doesn't seem to have a copyright to the name (since there are already 12 of these things). What if we just start our own? Then we can buy one of those brand new money printers everyone talks so much about instead of wasting our money on puts!  \n\n\nTLDR: Federal reserve is a private company. Start our own Federal Reserve of WSB. Purchase money printer.
