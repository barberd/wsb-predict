{"id": "gsrige", "title": "So i guess its time to talk about moderna again.", "selftext": "We will start with recent news and uptrend in stock. \nRecently news was announced that moderna is partnering with cordenpharma or atleast made to seem that way. What i didnt see was that moderna already had a contract with corden and it was simply extended. This is huge because it doesnt add any value to moderna. Things are as they were before this \u201cnews\u201d \n\nWhere does that mean for the future?\n\nWell it could mean corden is optimistic about moderna\u2019s covid-19 vaccine. Well not necessarily. If you already have a contract, whats the risk? Now on the off chance moderna is legit, whats the reward?\n\nStock price \u2014 \n\nWe have seen that insiders like to take gains somewhere between 6-15% jumps. Bigger money than you and me has definitely noticed this also. \n\nAlso the duds that didnt do their DD are probably catching up on finding out what they just panic bought into. Maybe they will over the weekend. \n\nI feel its very likely the price will fall 5-15% through today and the weekend.", "created_utc": 1590752934.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gsrige/so_i_guess_its_time_to_talk_about_moderna_again/", "is_self": true}
