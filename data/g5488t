{"id": "g5488t", "title": "Warning: US OIL ETFs are not tracking the spot price for oil. Be careful before exposing yourself.", "selftext": "I see tons of noobs here talking about longing or shorting the USO ETF or buying or selling USO calls. The next futures oil contract expires in May 19. \n\nThe USO ETF owns **31 % of the open interest of June Futures.** All this ETF does is buy next month futures. This forces them to buy higher and higher prices for oil compared to the underlying spot (currently **$25+** compared to the underlying spot which closed in the **negatives**). \n\nTrading CME futures are the only reliable way to trade oil. You will get absolutely demolished if you go balls deep into the USO ETF.", "created_utc": 1587426511.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5488t/warning_us_oil_etfs_are_not_tracking_the_spot/", "is_self": true}
