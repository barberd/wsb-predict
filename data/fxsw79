{"id": "fxsw79", "title": "The Perfect Storm: Oil [baseless speculation inside]- OPEC TELECONFERENCE AT 10AM", "selftext": "I believe we are about to witness a perfect storm form with oil over the next 2 months - this speculation is low probability but for some reason my intuition keeps regurgitating the following to me:\n\n1. OPEC will over do the production cut - right now expectations are 10 million Barrell cut. I believe OPEC will go full retard and cut over 20+ million barrels in production.\n\n2. US might be vulnerable with Saudis and Russians looking to take advantage - Trump claims he\u2019s been stockpiling reserves but if there is one thing we can be certain of is that this is 90% false. US probably hasn\u2019t bought a single barrel and we can assume Saudis and Russia have been hoarding, waiting to price gouge when the time is right.\n\n3. The curves of COVID-19 are beginning to lower globally, expect huge surge in demand - there are significant supply chain back orders and outstanding contracts that need to be filled. It\u2019s worth speculating global production will surge to a minimum 50% increase over average (prior to pandemic) so that manufacturing can catch up with unfinished orders. This surge in global production and manufacturing will run through stockpiles twice the rate anticipated and the OPEC cuts will lag behind, eventually reach a point where demand exceeds production volume for a short term.\n\n4. The Saudis and Russians have probably spent the majority of the last 2 months hedging their positions - I believe we will see an enormous short squeeze.\n\nEDIT: 5. China is about to ramp their manufacturing machine up probably 200%.\n\nEDIT: 6. Additionally everyone has been held up in their own homes for so long I believe it\u2019s safe to predict this summer / later on (once pandemic has calmed down) will see travel numbers unlike anything on record. With this comes very high demand.\n\nWe shall see!\n\n\nUPDATE: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/oil-jumps-ahead-of-make-or-break-opec-meeting.html #1 is looking like it might be fairly accurate.", "created_utc": 1586440754.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxsw79/the_perfect_storm_oil_baseless_speculation_inside/", "is_self": true}
