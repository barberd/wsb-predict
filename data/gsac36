{"id": "gsac36", "title": "HBO Max", "selftext": "Okay retards, hear me out. \n\nI have been following ATT pretty extensively as I believe their organizational shift is positioning themselves for solid growth. \n\nHBO Max is offered for free if you have one of a variety of services (ATT unlimited plan, gig internet, and/or their new TV service). I spoke with a CSR last night who said she had over 100 calls of people upgrading their service or asking for activation of HBO Max. They have a solid movie selection for release, all the HBO go style services, and a solid selection of shows. The interface is clean, and easy to navigate. Up to 3 devices streaming at once, unsure of the total amount of device logins, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be limited. Their catalogue is slated to receive some more originals, and a bunch of other shows/movies over the next few weeks. See link below for announced.\n\n[this shit](https://pressroom.warnermediagroup.com/na/media-release/hbo-max/hbo-max-programming-overview)\n\nThe bad: HBO Max is not currently on roku or amazon\u2019s platform, but this is what I am watching. As people are binging the shit out of Netflix and amazon, movie choices kind of fucking suck on these, and the consumer is always looking for a new series at this point. They also released at a staggered level by omitting some, but plan to fill in those gaps within the week. \n\nWhat I am looking for and my current positions/plan:\n\nAnnouncement of a bigger slate of movies or trailers for originals. ATT has been blasting their new TV service commercials nonstop, and it honestly looks pretty solid (I\u2019d appreciate some input from anyone who made the switch). Platform support from Roku or Amazon would be huge as well as it makes it much easier to use/access. \n\nI sold out of my $29 and $30 calls prior to release, and are now looking to buy right back in with a target of $32c and $33c while they are cheap in August, September, and October. \n\nBonus: if ATT can figure out a way to offload directTV, their debt will be greatly reduced. The entire movement of the company here is to position themselves with time warner to be the entertainment/connectivity company. Bundles for cable/cell/internet will be very affordable options compared to company shopping as well in my opinion. Pretty sure that is what they are working towards. \n\nTL:DR - $32c/$33c 09/18, 32/33c 10/16 while they are cheap and news is not talking about the service much.", "created_utc": 1590686121.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gsac36/hbo_max/", "is_self": true}
