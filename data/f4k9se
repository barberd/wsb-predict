WORLDS LARGEST QUARANTINE! \n\nIts a stockmarkets wet dream the fearmongering environment were in. And what stocks rise at times like this? \n\nMedicine bitches.\n\n\n$INO just made a vaccine in three hours for Beer Plague. BOOM PROFIT!\n\nNow obviously this is a nothingburger. The vaccine is an untested prototype, theres no proof or verification this will be effective and at the earliest human testing starts in summer. HOWEVER they did just win a little media buzz and a nine million contract from Billy Gatez. This is far more then needed to make a good profit on this one. Calls for $5 on Feb 21st bitches.\n\n$PVAM was clued into me by one of the retards on this sub. It has five new products ready for deployment and looks promising. Also I doubled my money with them on Friday so whats the harm right? \n\n\nMedicine bitch.", "created_utc": 1581821072, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f4k9se/why_ino_and_pvam_calls_are_going_to_bring_tendies/", "is_self": true}
