{"id": "gx4m70", "title": "Trading Profitably", "selftext": " \n\nAlright you sick fucks, gonna blow your minds here before you lose all your money on faggy D options.\n\nGoing to share my trading strategy, and maybe just maybe at least one of you will have some brain cells to try instead of losing all of it in out of the money AAL or NCLH puts. Before you buy a stock do some DD and some technical analysis\n\nTechnical analysis:\n\nMy most profitable strat i personally use is the TTM squeeze, its available for free on TOS or Trading View if you watch any stock chart you'll notice that stocks typically go on a run and then go into a period of side ways trading. this is called consolidation often during this period the stock's Bollinger bands which measure the volatility of the stocks contract. the bollinger bands measure the 2 standard deviations of the stock. which means typically 95% of the stocks movement falls between these two deviations. now the other thing is the keltner channels which measure the average true range of the stock which is the typical movement on the chart when the bollinger bands fall inside of the keltner channels the stock is to be in a squeeze if you pull up any chart when this happens the stock stays in and then explodes out in any one direction. you can buy your calls or puts during this period when they are cheap as fuck and profit based on the movement in increased volatility after the squeeze fires if you also throw on a momentum indicator on top of this on a daily time frame you can see which way the stock is likely to fire if there is increased momentum towards the upside above the 0 line the stock is likely to move bullish below the 0 line then bearish. if you pull up an hourly chart and the daily chart and they're both in a squeeze with momentum moving to the upside on both charts the stock is 80% likely to fire off up. there is a book called mastering the trade by john carter that explains this way better than i feel like explaining if you're a true wall-street bets degenerate feel free to look up you tube videos on the squeeze.\n\nOptions:\n\nif you're looking on the daily time frame confirm that the monthly chart is also bullish or bearish depending. look to get options 1 MONTH OUT because you're trading on the daily time frame. to avoid theta decay do a debit or credit spread DO NOT Buy just straight calls or puts. theta decay will wreck you harder league of legends wreaked my mental sanity.\n\nRisk management:\n\nYour stop loss should be set to 2\\*ATR(average true range) so if a stock is trading 1.5 ATR your stop loss should be set at 1.5\\*2 = $3 below the current trading price. if a stock is currently trading at 10 your stop loss should be set at 7$ your profit target should be 2\\*Risk so if your risk is 3$ in the above example your profit target should be 16$ because the stock is going to be extremely volatile after this period you can really see moves like this. I typically stay in the trade till the trade loses momentum dont exit just because you have one red day see the over all trend. there is an another indicator i like to use for this TTM TREND it compares the 6 previous bars to see if the over all trend is still on the upside of down side. exit if your stop loss is hit or if you hit your profit target i typically take off 50% of my position at 2\\*Risk so at the worst that can happen i break even.\n\nso if you use risk management like this you only need 1 winner to cancel out 2 bad trades. which also means if you take 10 trades you only need to be right about 40% of the time to still be profitable.\n\nTrading:\n\nobey these rules and you'll be fine don't get greedy don't get fearful just trade based off the rules.\n\ni've noticed that when u use this strat about 75% of the time you'll be right in the direction of the movement if its just the daily time frame if a stock is in a squeeze with upward momentum both on the hourly and daily time frame then you'll be right about 80-90% of the time. this is my bread and butter trading strat. i use it every day. there are several you tube videos you can use to educate yourself on this topic.\n\nEntry: \n\nyour entry should be always near the 9 or 20 EMA look for Flag candle stick patterns. \n\nFeel free to ask any questions\n\narticle on how to find stocks that are in a squeeze.\n\nTLDR: use the ttm squeeze and proper risk management to be profitable in the long term you might get lucky a few times before you lose it all.", "created_utc": 1591363879.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gx4m70/trading_profitably/", "is_self": true}
