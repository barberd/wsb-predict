Chinese gov expects it to get worse, much worse. Hints the building of several new hospitals with large capacities (but we knew that)\n\n2. Despite efforts of Chinese gov people are still traveling for the new year (wont bore you with details why, not so easy to cancel vacation)\n\n3. All schools, colleges, internships closed (expected)\n\n4. Here is the kicker to the economy, this virus is early stage and jobs are already closing. Many work places have mandates telling people not to work unless you are an essential employee, some people still don\u2019t want to go. This hits the poor areas harder, the manufacturing districts, which will have trade/supply impacts for the U.S. if this gets much worse.   \n\n5. There are also hints (because china doses this) that the gov is not telling the whole story. (other news outlets have suggested this) but im not going to speculate on this, small impact, it\u2019s just something to keep in mind if the news were to be official then the impact could be huge.\n\nThis is not everything but a small summary of what is causing the overreaction. Typically, looking back at Ebola and others, the market tends to over react at first, bounce back a little in a bull trap as people see it as a buying opportunity before falling some more, then finally recovering in a short time (under a month) Ive been out of the market since Friday but I anticipate being back in soon. Bearish for 1-2 weeks then bullish again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is what i posted Friday on a different platform (couldn't post it here because i had to make a new account) on how to trade if you are interested. Most of these plays have ended but there is still some growth here. Some plays may still be there if it gets worse\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n\nIntuitively you think the following stocks would be up but here\u2019s why they are not:\n\n$MMM \u2013 masks are a small part of 3M business; its other segments will hurt more than masks will add to their bottom line down during Ebola, this is confirmed as it is set to open down\n\nAlso keep in mind most healthcare goes down as the market freaks out and sells off and there\u2019s trade concerns. So don\u2019t just buy anything because its healthcare.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat Did well in outbreaks \u2013 look for business with a product mix that will profit the most ex. A provider of only protective gear not one where it is a small portion of their overall business\n\n$LAKE Ebola it was up 300% premarket 16% Monday and up today 1/30\n\n$APT same play as $LAKE\n\nDifferent BIO tech stocks will move based on who is actively looking for a cure, gov grants, ect. Generally, biotech does well. Take a look at $ABBV \n\nSome forget clean up as part of prevention $CLX", "created_utc": 1580396327, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ew6n55/conravirus_outlook_and_call_with_chinese_friend/", "is_self": true}
