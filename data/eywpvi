Let me know what I got right and what's wrong. Thanks bros!\n\nIn this scenario:\n\nStrike Price: $1,500 (stonk needs to reach/go above this price to be ITM by February 14th)\n\nBreakeven: $1,524.78 (stonk needs to reach this point for me to cancel out the price I'll be paying for the contract)\n\nTo Breakeven: +58.98% what TSLA would have to do to get to strike price based on current\n\n% Change/Change: not sure what this is? Change in contract price since last updated?\n\nPrice: $24.78 (price of 1 contract, that gives me right to buy 100 shares of TSLA at $1,500 on or before February 14)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast thing, as the actual stock price approaches the strike price, the price of the contract will go up based on how far away we are from expiry date, right? So if it goes to $1,499 on 2/6, the contract will be worth much more than it'll be worth if it's at $1,499 on 2/13?", "created_utc": 1580849027, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eywpvi/can_someone_please_eli5_autist_in_training/", "is_self": true}
