When we first heard about kung flu it was advertised as some natural flu that came about from unsanitary conditions in China. It killed the old people and young people were barely affected by this. Turns out if you catch this \"flu\" its going to at least severely scar your lungs, force you to stay onto a respirator and probably kill you if you arent on one. I propose this flu isnt a flu at all, and its Chemical Warefare made by some country, possibly the Chinese. \n\nWere currently in a \"trade war\" with China, these days wars arent fought in battle , but in currency, and possible chemical or non traditional ways. The Chinese have a lot to gain from this, if they force the Chinese people to stay at home, and threaten them with jail/worse , they will most likely end the virus in China once the sick die off or recover. Its like they knew exactly how to deal with it, because possibly they made it, or their government system is just better suited to force this. Not to mention their economy will be back in full effect in the near future, while ours is sitting at home doing absolutely nothing, for months. At the end of this the Chinese will most likely have months of GDP while we print more money. \n\nThis Chinese have been very indirect about this, lying about numbers, nobody can speak out about anything or they will probably be killed, and many businesses have been sending copy paste messages about how not to worry about it. Xi may be putting trump and the US in its place with this, i dont believe this is naturally occurring, this is some SARS man made shit. This type of thing has never happened to this effect and this is a very scary thing to know, the kind of thing preppers prep for. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot to mention everything going on with Oil prices, the US is literally getting wrecked right now. So many companies can go under and need bailouts because of this, which isnt good for our country anyway because we already have a ridiculous deficit. Airlines, cruise lines, parks, restaurants, energy/oil, are all about to require bailouts, not to mention Banks arent doing great either. There is a lot that could and probably is going to happen that hasnt been priced in yet. \n\nMost people still have their last paycheck coming in and some cash, wont be many months before people are flat broke and unemployment skyrockets, to possible unprecedented levels  These checks may hold people over (if they happen) but this ride could get pretty outta control  if we dont handle it correctly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTTLDR Stay at home, this isnt some bat flu this is black death jr + Will severely destroy US economy and business", "created_utc": 1584906096.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fn5qnq/tin_foil_hat_time_how_the_chinese_are_about_to/", "is_self": true}
