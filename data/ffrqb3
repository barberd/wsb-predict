We are headed to the core. [Germany](https://ca.investing.com/indices/germany-30) is fucked, [Italy](https://ca.investing.com/indices/italy-40-futures) is fucked, [UK](https://ca.investing.com/indices/uk-100) is fucked and if the US exchanges didn't limit downside, this side of the pond would probably be pretty clearly fucked as well.\n\nNaturally the VIX is also poppin' so stay safe out there and look out for the prowling Theta gang trying to gouge your eyes out on deep OTM weeklies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Time to call bullshit. On what you might ask? \"Every-fucking-thing\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: Thoughts and prayers for the bull gang.
