Fuck I was conviced they will make some dope test kits for the beer virus and get some nice contracts for some nice tendies.\n\nBeing an european autist I bought some option warrants on DeGiro worth 1k exp in june with a strike of 35.\n\nWaking up to an incredible +18% rise in stock price.\n\nLooking at the bid from the bank I realized that I am gay and I got cucked. My initial price included time value and inner values.\n\nAfter a company takeover the time value becomes worthless...thus ending up -10% instead of getting to tendie heaven, because on day of company takeover you will get the company takeover stock price minus strike price. Basically if the company plans to take over and bids a stock price below your strike price you are fucked.\n\nTLDR: Dont buy options on a company that might get taken over or gay\n\nDAX to 11600 EOD fucking bull trap", "created_utc": 1583231371, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcsoa5/til_time_value_of_options_becomes_worthless_at/", "is_self": true}
