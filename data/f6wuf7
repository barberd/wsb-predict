DD inside.", "selftext": "Why SPCE will now crash:\n\n* Company is not worth 1 billion dollars let alone 8 billion.\n* They have only one operational 'spaceplane'.  If it crashes the stock goes to zero.\n* Their 'spaceplane' only goes up to 80km. That is not the definition of space.\n* Tourists only get 4 minutes of zero gravity and a few more minutes of a cool space view... all for $250,000.\n* If they fly every single day taking 8 pax daily. That is 750 million in revenue. REVENUE not profit. It is going to be expensive manning this operation just to send 8 people into high altitude every day.\n* Virgin Orbit. The rocket delivery side of the business has been carved out and is its own company.\n* If Bezos offers space tourism on an actual rocket it will be far more popular. I'd rather strap in to a rocket than just go into space on a plane.\n* SPCE is a meme stock. Now entering low energy phase.\n* Earnings report on the 25th Feb will likely lead to 150+ million in losses with very little (if any) revenue.\n* PUTS PUTS PUTS", "created_utc": 1582221424, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6wuf7/spce_is_going_to_crash_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
