I was fooling around paper trading them last night to \u201cget a feel\u201d for it. My questions:\n\n1) It seems a lot simpler than options, is this true? \n\n2) Flatten means just to close out the position completely right?\n\n3) Are the contracts really as liquid as in paper trading. I almost got everything filled immediately (I know with options sometimes it takes a while to fill that order). \n\n4) Have any of you actually make money over time trading futures?\n\nAlso - MU calls to $90 on sale right now!", "created_utc": 1560529433, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c0m2bq/futures_traders_of_wsb_questions_about_it/", "is_self": true}
