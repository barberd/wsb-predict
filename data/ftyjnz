{"id": "ftyjnz", "title": "Rigged after hours", "selftext": "I've traded full time since October of 2018. I  tend to do a lot of after hours trading in the futures options market because of the illiquidity issues large players have entering and exiting the market. And there's just opportunity for nimble single traders to capitalize in these markets. I probably average 12 hours a day either trading or doing trading related activities. \n\nNow maybe 10 times in the last year and a half i've seen what i'm going to call the \"pricing anomaly\". Let's take a few minutes ago for example. Put pricing suddenly deepens unexpectedly. I'm not saying the spread widened, i'm saying the pricing is increasing without a relative move in ES\\_F futures. This is accompanied by \"large\" purchases (for after hours) in the FUT-OP market. \n\nNot once have i seen these positions be wrong. Some \"larger\" player is entering the market beforehand. And you know it's imminent when it goes down this way. For your reference, please see ES\\_F futures options puts traded for 4/3 expiry at 2500 strike. at UTC 19:54-20:03.\n\nI'm usually able to capitalize on or exit my position when i see this happening. But it feels scummy. The market makers delivering a spread that does not make sense, that has changed rapidly, without a corresponding futures movement, i'd love other explanations for this. \n\nI'm drunk but the veracity of these claims stand.
