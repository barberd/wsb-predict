(Not saying I do but 20$ is a Msft May 15th 300$ call)\n\nAnyways I need one of your \"Expert\" traders to explain to a low life like myself why some idiot is buying puts at 25$ for DFS that expires on April 24th. At a Range of .35-.45 cents.\n\nTo give you more leverage to rape me verbally I'll state there are alot better option buys that increase your chances at \"Charlie Sheen Winning\".\n\nSuch as at the time of writing the 26$ doesnt even have a bid so it could come in much lower. The 24$ just sold of .25 cents a share. There are all different types of other scenarios that would be an easier gain.\n\nSo I need a true savant to explain to me why a person or program is purchasing the 25$ out from a nobody like me. Learn me something PLEASE.\n\nThat being said currently the 25$ put is 29% out of the money and is paying almost 50% return rate on a year or 1.6% realized gain on premium/collateral alone.\n\nThanks for your precious time.", "created_utc": 1586882562.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g18zar/dfs_autist/", "is_self": true}
