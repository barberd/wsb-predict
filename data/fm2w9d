Monday at open and today at close were both exceptionally bad -\n\nWho else is experiencing this and does anyone have screenshots of it? Looking for \"option does not exist\" or any other errors. \n\n $tdameritade .1p 3/23\n\n\nEdit: after an hour and fifty minutes I got the full honest answer -\n\nTDameritrade has a KNOWN vendor issue. It effected Monday mornings trades on SPY calls and affected Fridays SPY calls. Monday between 9:30 and 10:00, and the last fifteen minutes plus on Friday. \n\nThe Trader mobile app is being discontinued and replaced by ToS mobile. Any losses or transactions effected will not have resolution. \n\nI recommend finding a different broker - their offer was to have some options trade fees waived. \n\nTl;Dr - trusted TDameritrade, lost 100k due to KNOWN vendor issues that have not been corrected.
