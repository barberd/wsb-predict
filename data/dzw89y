My man\u2019s just created a fucking tank, like why in the fuck did he even make the point of saying it\u2019s bullet proofed against 9MM bullets? Like obviously Elon\u2019s marketing this shit to some dumbass who\u2019s tryna start some street warfare good God. Wasn\u2019t the point of this to make something to rival the top selling pick up trucks in America? I don\u2019t know a single redneck that would be caught driving this shit. The entire stock is fucked in the ass and this shit\u2019s going back to 300 god fucking dammit my calls are worthless thanks Elon.\n\nOn a side not: the cybertruck is so fucking autistic that I nominate it to become the official car of WSB. The design is looks like some shit s kid on the short bus would draw when you\u2019d ask him to draw a car that can go underwater.
