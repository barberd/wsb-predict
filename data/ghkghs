Up, Down, and Sideway. This rings my ball (a ~~small~~ nano one). Isn't this all just Quantum Physics?\n\nNow, for those who watched Ant-Man, all knows quantum physics in depth already. But, lets still review some basics.\n\n*\\[Physics\\]* When observing things, you are observing a reflection of electromagnetic wave bouncing off objects. So, basically, you cannot see something without touching one, and when you touch one, you change it. This phenomenon indeed has a name: **The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.**\n\n*\\[Stock\\]* How does this apply to stock? The price of each stock and contract are floating between bid and ask spread. In order to know the true price of a stock, you must place your bid/ask, but this is essentially changing its price. I would like to call it: **The Autistic Gambling Principle.**\n\n\\----\n\n*\\[Physics\\]* So what is in a particle? We don't know! When you look closely, a particle is just a blurry sphere of influences that we know existed.\n\n*\\[Stock\\]* When you look into a stock, you would think it is constructed with some solid hard 10-K sheet, financial statements, and fundamentals. But, this is where you are wrong! A stock is just like particles. it is a sphere of influences that we only know existed but don't know what of.\n\n\\----\n\n*\\[Physics\\]* When scientist try to predict a particle with using Quarks, Leptons, and Bosons, they failed bad. Because they did not anticipate the stage itself, the gravity!\n\n*\\[Stock\\]* This is why many of the epic DD we see here failed so hard. They did not accounted for the almighty United State of America Federal Reserve System. (For those retarded fuck, this is the full name of \"Fed\" that you see in the shitpost here).\n\n\\----\n\n# Abstract:\n\nDON'T PANIC HERE! Be hold my autistic friends! The chosen one has already shared the ultimate solution for this fucked up situation. **The theory of everything - The String Theory.**\n\nString Theory is able to describe many particles as different modes of vibration of a string. Most importantly, this includes gravity.\n\n*\\[Stock\\]* In the name of Stonk God, here, I announce the era of **The Quantum Trading Theory**.\n\n# Chapter 1: Stonk Only Go Up\n\nLet me get this straight. Don't trust the title. stock DOES NOT go up. In fact, it wants to go flat or sideways. Why? Because, stock price is partially observed by crowd with using broker platform under masks (the bid/ask spread). And, its actual price is determined with trader spooking it constantly. When it is relaxed in a zero volume moment, the price will continue to be flat until someone try to unveil its true price.\n\nThis true nature helps the formation of the infamous **Theta Gang**. During a peaceful day, theta gang's win ratio is great because of the behavior described above. When trading volume declines, it is the best to practice Theta Gang. While you can, you should also monitor volume constantly, in observation of the quickest tank that happened 2/19/2020. The volume dramatically doubled in two day, when this happens, dump all your shit and run. It is okay to take some loss. You will recover form the next move.\n\n# Chapter 2: F, The Fed Coefficient\n\nThis is where you go to college class in the second week and got blown away by how professor jumped the topic from *V = IR*   to   *I\\_c = I\\_s \\* (e\\^(V\\_be/V\\_t) - 1) \\* (1 + V\\_ce / V\\_a)*.\n\nI will emphasis again stock price is determined by trader taking action (volume).\n\n[Quantum Trading - The Golden Equation](https://preview.redd.it/chw6n1s1o3y41.png?width=111&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a592580d39d6cff9d65967e59c1b5c58ad9b233)\n\nIn this equation, the price movement is a summation of Fed's desire minus movement of volume.\n\nWhat does Fed want? They want USA rally to moon. The is the beauty of The Theory of Quantum Trading. I have just invented **The Fed Coefficient, F**. We default this to be a positive coefficient.\n\n# Chapter 3: Volume Effect (The Gay Bear Effect)\n\nContinuing on the quantum trading - **The Golden Equation** from chapter 2. When trader takes action, they are simply guessing. The trend of guessing establishes the price movement. In another explanation, the change of price is negatively correlated to the change of volume.\n\nBy logic, there is always a gay bear speaking the loudest on top of the world. This is very much like the existence of cockroach. They are just there. No one knows why they are so resilient.\n\nBack to quantum trading. Most trader are embedded with gay bear soul. This is just as much as a \"Born evil or Born good\" question. I have a yet to be proved hypothesis: **Trader Are Born Gay**.\n\nUnder the creation of Stonk God, every time we enter our bid/ask. We always try to enter a tiny bit lower to ensure a fill. This nature of gay bear behavior established the relationship between stock price and volume. The more trade is entered, the more accumulation of this slight lower bid/ask price is entered. **Therefore, stock price go down with increase of volume**. **Vise versa, stock price go up with decrease of volume.**\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nWhen there is a equilibrium between The Fed Coefficient and the volume, trader should position their strategy with using **Theta Gang**.\n\nWhen there is a decline of volume, just like this past 2 weeks. **The Fed Coefficient** is dominating the price movement. Therefore, trader should NOT fight with Fed. Get as much CALLS as you can.\n\nIn the event of crisis, volume will increase. But, this never occurs overnight. Not even on the zoomer's memorial day, 2/19/2020. All trader should be aware when such trend starts and act quickly. The strategy under **Volume Effect (The Gay Bear Effect)** is to get as much PUTS as you can.\n\nHere, we have concluded and covered the necessary actions and plays under all three scenarios that traders are historically being fucked. Namely, ~~pussy, anal, and oral~~. Up, Down, and Sideway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Disclaimer: The research paper is not back tested with any data, hence the name, theory.\n\n\\*If any graduate student slave would like to get your PhD in the study of **The Quantum Trading Theory**.
