{"id": "hhiz0w", "title": "Trump bans H1Bs. Buy Outsourcers", "selftext": "No Indian Outsourcing company wants to have people in USA. It costs them 65$/hr and clients pay 72$/hr. On the other hand the same people cost them 10$/hr in India and they can bill clients 30$/hr so the profit margins on having a person in India rather than US is 200% vs 10%.\n\nHowever clients are not comfortable sending the entire work offshore and insist on having a 1:2 ratio with 1 person onsite for every two offshore. They feel something is lost in translation if they dont have onsite folks to interact with.\n\nNow two things have happened -\n\n1. People have been working in full remote mode for 3 months and pretty much debunked the myth of the watercooler - that in office serendipitic interactions are needed for innovation. Slack is good enough to hang out on\n2. Trump is banning H1Bs.\n\nThis gives a good excuse to outsourcing companies who would much rather have a person work out of India than out of the US and client really cant complain. This means outsourcers will be making 200% margins instead of 10% margins.\n\nBuy stocks of outsourcers like ACN, INFY, WIT,CTSH,IBM.\n\nIf you want to be retarded buy INFY 7/17 10 C. They are reporting results on 7/15 and the quarter is going to be low on revenue but beat on earnings due to the increased margin of people working out of India (noone has come onsite in this entire quarter as Indian govt banned travel to USA from March 23)\n\nEdit 1:  If you want to play it a different way you can also buy stocks in companies which have set up their own captive centers in India - MSFT, NTAP, ADBE,NCR,GE. \n\nThey will all benefit as the quality of talent available is going to go up as people who would have travelled to US earlier will now take jobs in India.\n\nAnother way to play this is that Indian startups like PayTM, Flipkart, Ola will get a choice on talent. Many of these startups have investments from Tencent, Alibaba and SoftBank. You can BUy SFTBY,BABA,TCEHY\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1593367021.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hhiz0w/trump_bans_h1bs_buy_outsourcers/", "is_self": true}
