The SMART money (aka the most money) is betting on an earnings flop. And it will, because here is exactly what is going to happen, in Socratic Dialogue format:\n\nWSB Autist: Costco built a store in China! They're going to build another one soon! Earnings is on October 3rd!!!! I'm going to YOLO $300 calls and beat the market so bad it will look like Rhianna after she talked back to Chris!\n\nEarnings Reality Monster: Costco has 770 stores worldwide, making China's store worth about one-tenth of one percent of revenue. The second store will bring that up to two-tenths of one percent. Idiot.\n\nWSB Autist: Typical bear, you'll see on earnings day, too the moon!\n\nEarnings Reality Monster: No, you will see, we're going to post a beat that won't be what you expected, and revenue will be more or less in line. Guidance will be decent but nothing to write home about.\n\nWSB Autist: But what about China?! There's like a billion people there?!?!\n\nEarnings Reality Monster: We're a fucking grocery store dude. We're not fucking GoPro. Slim margins and guaranteed revenue from selling $50 subs, idiot. \n\nWSB Autist: But that $2.00 hotdog!!!\n\nEarnings Reality Monster: Oh I get it now, you just really like the store, ah ok. Well I have some OTM calls to sell you for next week. Want some?\n\nWSB Autist: TO THE MOON!", "created_utc": 1569696521, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dak2dh/reminder_costco_is_a_grocery_store_and_one_store/", "is_self": true}
