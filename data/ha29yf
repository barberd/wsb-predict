HTZ-33.57% which has drawn feverish buying interest from bargain-hunting investors, even though the company\u2019s bankruptcy means that there is little if any equity value in the enterprise.\n\nThus far, mom-and-pop investors have outperformed pros like Cooperman and mutual funds, according to a research report from Goldman Sachs. It\u2019s unclear, however, how long that outperformance will last and to the degree by which individual investors are piling into risky investments with reckless abandonment.\n\n*angry billionaire noises*\n\n[Article](https://www.google.be/amp/s/www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/guid/8DCB53DE-AF2E-11EA-885A-481D889F3439)", "created_utc": 1592307345.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ha29yf/billionaire_leon_cooperman_warns_robinhood_retards/", "is_self": true}
