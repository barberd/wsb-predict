{"id": "craedi", "title": "Buy the $KAREN", "selftext": "Some autist on my last post about the $BECKY asked about FB as a long play. I informed this autist that Faceplace is Instagram for old dried up Beckies which got me thinking. \n\nI crushed an addy and here we have it\n\n\nMy autists, I give you the $KAREN\n\n1. Target: the stomping grounds of middle class Karen's everywhere. Shits slightly more expensive than Walmart, so it gives them a feeling of status, like they used to have when they were young and hot. Pre popping out some crotch spawn and going from and hourglass figure to rectangle. \n\n2. Kohl's: This joint is the shitty discounted version of Lulu\n\n3. Starbucks: the bucks transcends a single index because it really is a defining character trait of Karen's worldwide. Couldn't not include it.\n\n4. Adidas: back when Karen's were still hot (1990) adidas was popping on the hip hop scene, which made it cool. Karen still buys their shit because at this point she's conditioned to.\n\n5. Facebook: Karen got on this train late, attempting to follow in the footsteps of her BECKY daughter, who had already moved to IG. The fact the people have to actually mutually follow each other made it so Karen can actually get a following. No one on IG pays attention to 40 year old #supermoms #bossbabes #queens. They literally exist to validate each other. Therefore Karen gets her dopamine fix from shit posting on FB.\n\n6. Toyota: this one bites because personally I love their trucks. The Rav4 is the slightly cooler CRV that lower class Karen's can expect after 10 years of driving a ford windstar mini van. They also offer the 4runner, which is retardedly expensive but guarantees the kids can drive through the jungles of 'Nam and make it to soccer practice on time if the situation requires. Great for hauling groceries or sudden civil unrest. \n\nThat's it for now", "created_utc": 1565980013, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/craedi/buy_the_karen/", "is_self": true}
