My favorite conceptual target is Zuck because he's at the center of facebook, now at the center of politics, and he's the youngest billionaire alive or whatever.\n\nFigure out who Mark Zuckerberg's entire facebook is in real life. His family, close friends, and close politicians are all that matter. You can probably ignore the cute asian girls I'm sure he's always out there with flirting (thank you, social network, you were a good movie)\n\nThen, find out what the most vulnerable positions in his network are. Companies with basically no cash capital, huge cashflows, and little stability in a volatile market (think the guys who sold Zuck his mega-yacht and the ones paying him to interact with think tanks)\n\nThen, start watching the vulnerable markets, with a focus on his network's part of those markets. Then, figure out who has the biggest position move to make if something bad happens in that market, and start analyzing the rationality of the actors inside that small part of the market as best you can. \n\nthen, as fast as you can, make sure you have a computer program written to watch these dynamics take hold, and make it text you or email you as soon as you think the indicators are telling you that vulnerable person is about to sell. Make sure you know they have a big position and that them selling will have a real impact in the price of that stock, bond, or future. \n\nThen YOLO the world's biggest FD OTM weekly. Then pray to God I'm not a retard who mis-guided you. GOOD LUCK! \n\nTL;DR: ZUCK IS CUCK, abuse him, he'll like it. I would, but I'm completely out of money and I'm just a reddit karma whore.", "created_utc": 1579121008, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ep8482/im_back_to_talk_about_fight_club_after_my_two/", "is_self": true}
