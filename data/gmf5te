Chief Executive Officer, Isaac Israel said that \u201cthese phase 1 results are encouraging and indicate that CM-24 at higher doses warrants further evaluation in a larger clinical study and we are proud to be able to present them as a poster at ASCO 2020. They also raised an addition 10 million in capital indicating future progressions in their drugs clinical trials. In addition, Kitov has entered into a clinical collaboration agreement with Bristol Myers Squibb Company (BMY) for the planned Phase 1/2 clinical trials to evaluate the combination of CM-24 with the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab (Opdivo). Multiple hedge funds own and have bought more shares recently, Armistice doubled their position to now holding 5 million shares and Morgan Stanley also holds the stock. I definitely expect a run up before the PR statement so even though the PR will probably be very positive, this will be more of a buy the rumor and sell the news.", "created_utc": 1589852617.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gmf5te/ktov/", "is_self": true}
