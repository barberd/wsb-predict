I won\u2019t go into details why their business sucks because there are a million other threads explaining (or you could just read their latest 10q.); this post is more about why I think deep otm September puts are specifically a good deal. \n\nThey are currently trading in the mid 60s and have been down trending sharply and continuously for months. 9/20 $35 puts are currently trading at ~70-80 cents (large spread, unfortunately) with IV of 65%. \n\nThere are a few reasons those puts may be deep itm by expiration:\n\n1) Ipo price was around 20$ and I think that may be a fairish value; certainly more than fair at current revenues. It did trade around this price for about a month after IPO giving this number some legitimacy. \n\n2) Privateer has said they won\u2019t sell any shares in the first half of 2019; this gives 3 months of unloading before expiration; because of point #1, it is my opinion that they will unload until the stock price resides around IPO price; it cannot reasonably expect it to rise higher than this price based on fundamentals for the foreseeable future and if they are reasonable actors concerned with making the most money, I believe that they will lock up as much profit as possible above IPO prices. \n\n3. TLRY is somewhat correlated to the recent sharp downward volatility of the overall market; TLRY had sharp drops that roughly (but not exactly) correlated with overall market trends without significantly recovering with SPY in the past few months. If there is another sharp market dip in the next 6 months (which I beleive will eventually happen but can\u2019t say for sure when obviously) then that will further drive TLRY down. \n\nCONS: \n\n1) wide bid-ask spread: this is a chronic problem with TLRY options, but I believe there is a good chance that these will be so deep ITM that slippage will be tolerable. However this means that putting a large percentage of capital in this in case you need to sell before the thesis plays out. \n\n2) TLRY still has a low float and will until privateer starts unloading shares; this makes it susceptible to random insane pumps. they said they wouldn\u2019t unload for the first half of 2019; they announced this just before ipo lockup ended likely to prevent a firewall centered around one day; my thesis is largely based on reading between the lines that they will start unloading this summer. \n\n3) long expiration option are boring. \n\nThis bet is potentially a 10-20x play if this thesis plays out; chances of TLRY being around ipo prices by September I would say are least in the ballpark of 5-10%, making this likely a +ev bet, but odds are not high enough to bet the farm on this. \n\nI have entered a small position of 46 contracts bought at an average of .78.
