This technology is called Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILS). Essentially how this works is when you have a tumor your body generates lymphocytes, these lymphocytes fuck up the cancer cells causing the tumor. \n\nOnly issue is cancer fucks up your immune system so it prevents the generation of these cells\n\nSo what this company is doing is taking the lymphocytes out from the tumor, having them multiply to billions and then injecting the shit right back inside where the tumor is chilling at.\n\nSounds simple, but it has had great results. In previous studies they\u2019ve had over 24% patients out of 93 that had a total elimination of the tumor after treatment. And 56% having a reduction in tumor size. \n\nThis is one of the only companies specializing and dedicating their whole company to these types of treatments, they are the inevitable future of cancer research.\n\nThey\u2019re releasing results for this via live stream at the ASCO convention. \n\nLiterally can\u2019t go tits up. \n\nIOVA 55c 7/17", "created_utc": 1589503534.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gjz2jm/insane_results_of_tumor_targeting_therapy/", "is_self": true}
