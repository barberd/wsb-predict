{"id": "giiv5x", "title": "Options Activity : You guys are totally sleeping on the Put/Call ratio setup for DKNG", "selftext": "As of the writing of this post\n\nThere is 8.77k OI at the May 5/15 $30 strike, with 70k in volume being traded at that level today. The OI is going to be FAR higher tomorrow morning to reflect the new volume at this level.\n\nDKNG is already nearing $30 before earnings.  If this stock is at all above 30 after earnings those calls are going to be exercised and the stock is going to completely take off like a rocket.\n\nThe exact same set up was present today which we saw with DDOG. There was a tiny put/call ratio with large OI at the 55/60 levels. This morning it opened up at 60 and the calls began to get exercised driving the stock up.\n\nThe put to call ratio for DKNG according to Flowalgo is .079.\n\nMost of the calls being bought are sweeps - meaning retail investors are buying.\n\nEarnings are friday morning. This stock has two more days of likely running up before earnings. I would buy.\n\nTLDR: DKNG is the next SPCE.", "created_utc": 1589312952.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/giiv5x/options_activity_you_guys_are_totally_sleeping_on/", "is_self": true}
