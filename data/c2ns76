The Company has $3.5B in debt, which is largely responsible for the recent share price drop. However they have enough liquidity available and recently received a $183M insurance payout on the failed satellite: [https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2019-05-03/maxar-technologies-to-receive-full-insurance-payout-for-worldview-4-satellite-loss](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2019-05-03/maxar-technologies-to-receive-full-insurance-payout-for-worldview-4-satellite-loss)\n\n \n\nThe Company (Maxar Techologies) consists of several branches which joined together in early 2017: Space Systems (manufacturing of Space equipment) , Digitalglobe (Satellite imagery), Radiant (Geospatial analytics), MDA (independent Canadian part of the business: Robotics, Space sensors etc.) and has since been taken over by a new highly competent CEO.  \n \n\nRead here an interview with the CEO Dan Jablonsky about Worldview-Legion, which will be their new constellation of imagery satellites scheduled for launch in early 2021. Right now Capex is high due to this project but this will drive tremendous free cash flow if successful. Margins on their imagery results are 60.5%!
