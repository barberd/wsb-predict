They also work in neighboring states and have started in the northeast in places such as Massachusetts.\n\nNow, let me start by saying this company has fucked up, and their price shows it.  Sunworks used to be called Solar3D.  They claimed to have incredible 3D tech, that would blow away everything else being used in solar.  Long story short, they didn't.  Management was fired.  All of them.\n\n* Hire Chuck Cargile as CEO\n* Hire new management with deep background in solar.\n\nJust in October of 2019 they hired Judith Hall, previously worked for one of the largest solar companies in north America (recurrent energy)\n\n* PROFITABILITY.\n\nThe previous management was trash as discussed.  Current management has been working to get rid of low margin deals, and replace them with much more profitable deals.  If you look at their recent earnings reports, you will see they were very close to being profitable except for their last Q1 where they paid off almost all of their debt.  They also had $40M backlog of new orders coming into the 2020 year.\n\nCoronavirus fueled the downtrend of this stock and brought it to .38  then they had their earnings call, of Q1 2020 in march.  This call predicted profitability in the second quarter of 2020 due to the number of permits that were not finalized in Q1 of 2020.  The delays in finalization of permits was due to the coronavirus, and the cities not having enough workers to fill demand.  However, they expect everything to pick back up with the economy re-opening.  which I have been expecting would lead to a great Q2.\n\nThey have since climbed to .70 ( Progress!)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd guess what... They just filed to have a vote to eliminate 150M of common stock.  (GOOD SIGN)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall The price for this thing can explode long term and short term.  Short term this will be above 1$ in a month.  close to 2 by the end of summer IMO.  And the rest is based off performance.  But they are in the prime position to start printing bills.\n\nI can't put in a ton of money as I'm a peasant, but just so you guys know I'm not trying to jebait into a trash stock.  Here's what i've got.  Yeah 100% in and I'm using robinhood.  I think I've been told not to do those.  Yolo.   Not worried one bit about avging up.  Still buying on dips.  Started at .38\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRisks for this stock, if they do not reach profitability this quarter they will have to do a reverse stock split, however that would make no sense since they just issued decision to remove 150m commonstock shares so now they are issuing 50M rather than 200M  Still if they do not reach 1$ by september they will have to do a split or be removed.  This will happen if they do not reach profitability this quarter.\n\nAnyone have any other Thoughts on this stock?\n\n[Also if you're a penny flipper, see my daily loss.  This stock's volatile.  had a 30&#37; gain yesterday and news on reducing outstanding shares came out today.  I predict back to high .70s tomorrow.  If not.
