I remember saving up 3k before i went to study abroad and it was SO MUCH MONEY!\n\nI blew all that shit in Japan when It was so expensive to live. I taught English for meals between classes.\n\nAt one point I was cleaning toilets at night, studying while working at a computer lab during the day, and delivering pizza on weekends between class.\n\nI remember smoking resin because I couldn't afford weed. God knife hits are the worst.\n\nI remember my first internship at a large firm, my intern roommate asked me if i could just give them \"all the rent for the summer, so we didn't have to deal with collecting money\" and he \"had his paychecks sent to his apartment he kept over the summer during college.\". I remember being fucking floored at the audacity of the situation. I drove down there in my 23 year old ford taurus with everything that I owned in my car. I laughed and told him I couldn't pay until I got paid. This was just 6 years ago.\n\nMy first year with the firm I remember wondering how I'd get to the client site because I wasn't sure I'd have enough for gas going back and forth for the first two weeks until we got paid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI remember one of my roommate's dad's, a partner with the firm in another city thinking we lived in the ghetto during my internship. He was horrified.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI remember my intern roommate thanking me for being the \"ambassador\" to the neighborhood because I hung out with my neighbors and BBQed and partied with them. They were BLACK OMFG YOU GUYS! WE LIVED IN THE HOOD RIGHT! It was pretty fucked up to hear that. The north side Chicago kid was always very cringe.\n\nThis isn't about race, creed, or status. Sorry I'm just rambling now.\n\nThis isn't an \"up and coming\" story. I've always thought of my life as very normal. I never really felt I had struggles more than the next. In retrospect I did more than some and less than others. Whatever.\n\nBut yesterday I was sitting there, and I vaporized $150 and it didn't bother me at all. Ooops, caught the scalp on the wrong way and got about before more damage.\n\nIt occurred to me that I paid my dog walker $150 a month to take my dog on hikes because I'm a fucking yuppy now with a busy job and we aren't usually at home all day. I broke even in that sense. But my dog walker? They're me not long ago.\n\nI honestly don't know what I would've done if this was happening 4-5 years ago. I'd assume I'd be getting support from parents, something I never really tried to ask for before, but I had a network of support, sure. But not everyone does. And I haven't really been in a situation where I've had to ask.\n\nI've lost money in my 401k. But I earned some back on PUTs watching the world burn. I have friends who are hoping to not get laid off.\n\nI'm lucky my company sells shit to grocery stores and my wife's tech company isn't going to fold. We have a nice income and live in a fine house and are able to continue our world remotely while others are completely devastated by the disruption to the local economy.\n\nSo last night we ordered pizza and tipped 50%.\n\nToday we e-mailed our dog walker to tell her we'll keep paying her despite not walking our dog.The cleaning ladies will get paid too.\n\nsure I could save myself another $500 a month by not doing this. But I already am without going out to restaurants and using services. This isn't REALLY costing me anything. If I stop spending when my income isn't affected, I'm just hoarding cash and making money as the world burns.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBe a bear, make money. Try not to root too hard to it, and if you do, do your part. Get the fuck out there and spend money on those that keep your neighborhood great. Order food from your favorite restaurant down the way, and pay the person walking your pets. Donate to a charity if you want.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhatever the fuck you do, don't sit here and make money and not give back. If you're hoarding tendies right now, you're a fucking asshole and deserve a ban.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know this sub is generally good about donations, but you don't have to just meme donate to an autism organization because its funny. There's serious issues with certain sectors of the economy, and we need to take care of those people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf $150 loss doesn't phase you for a second, think about spending that on your local people right now. It definitely is phasing them.\n\nPlus you get to eat fucking pizza and feel good about yourself and shit. Come the fuck on and get spending.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*TL/DR\\*\\*\n\n**Pizza, tonight. Pay your house cleaners and dog walkers. Don't be a greedy asshole and spread the god damn tendies. Plus you get to eat pizza and shit and feel good about yourself ya asshole. You may have been there once in your life. Just think about it.**\n\nThere's no way to tell this story and not sound like a self righteous asshole but w/e, spread your tendies.", "created_utc": 1584819564.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmktql/yall_need_to_donate_some_tendies_to_your_local/", "is_self": true}
