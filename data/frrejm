You\u2019ve been holding puts all week, getting dicked left and right from falling vol, rising shares, the dirty whore known as Vega and her cumslut of a sister Theta. Your portfolio is hemorrhaging cash. mArKEtS ArE RigGEd!!? Right?\n\nNo. Your overall \u201cthesis\u201d is not incorrect, your timing was just fucking retarded. A ton of you bought puts with a vix at fucking 80+, after the market had fallen 32% nearly straight down in a matter of weeks\u2014the fastest decline of that magnitude we have ever seen. Of fucking course there would be a bounce. Now we are at a point where a ton of horrible shit is priced in, any bad news is barely going to move the market lower, and any good news will be bought. This is why futures are up this morning.\n\nYou know how you could have avoid this? By trading futures or even going all in on SPXS, as a means of avoid the raping you have received from falling premiums on options a country mile away from having a single cent in intrinsic value. Market makers who sold you puts with a vix at 80 love you guys, and I think based upon their positioning they will keep the market propped up at least through Tuesday, the end of the month & Q1. Rebalancing flows on a fucking massive scale will provide a bid to equities these next two days.\n\nIs it possible negative market sentiment overcomes that bid? Absolutely, but that\u2019s gonna be a big fucking bid given what transpired this quarter in any risk parity, 60/40 type portfolio. That\u2019s a big crowd.\n\nSo what do you do? If I were you I\u2019d fucking sell those puts and buy a shitload of SPXS instead, or short /ES or /MES if you\u2019re really poor after selling your puts. At the very least, expect some losses today and tomorrow, maybe consider buying more puts Tuesday night as one last swing. I\u2019m sure for many of you they\u2019re a lot cheaper now. If you can avoid it, which you absolutely can, **dont pay premiums in the first place** and especially not in this environment. How do you do that if you still want to be levered 3:1, or 50:1? ETFs and futures.\n\nThis will be horrific, and the bottom is not in yet. But markets are not one-directional and if you don\u2019t understand the technical factors that play in to them you will get taken advantage of by market makers, and folks like myself who see this shit coming while you\u2019re all drooling, jerking off to case counts, then crying yourselves to sleep as your portfolio continues to lose money while you watch your wife\u2019s boyfriend make up for how big of a disappointment you are, night after night.\n\nThere\u2019s better ways to express a short than SPY puts 1 month out with a breakeven fucking 30% below spot (as we sit 20% off the highs). Learn a lesson from your losses. This should be a time to build up cash so that when it\u2019s all said and done, you can load up on blue chips for 80% off and hold them for the next 15 years (seeing gains of 500-1000%+ and then you get to pay the long term cap gains rate as a cherry on top, PLUS you get a dividend once these fucks start making money again). You\u2019re not going to have that opportunity if you blow up your account on 0DTE puts and then bitch about how the markets rigged for the next 10 years.\n\nOr keep at it, lose it all, and destroy any chance of taking advantage of the super low prices that are coming.\n\nTLDR; market not likely to tank until after month/quarter end (Wednesday). Don\u2019t blow up your portfolio waiting for it. Expect a rally that will continue fuck a lot of you until then; after that have at it. Stop fucking around with puts and short /ES if you want to make more money.\n\nDisclosure: I shorted /ES at 2580 and 2560 Friday. Bought back at 2455 last night after the 6pm open for futures. I am now short /ES again at 2560 but not ruling out a run to 2600-2700 by Tuesday\u2019s close. If that happens I\u2019m shorting it even harder.\n\nEdit 3/30 11:30AM: There's 2600.", "created_utc": 1585577172.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frrejm/some_advice_for_the_put_holders_dont_burn_up_all/", "is_self": true}
