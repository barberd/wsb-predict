{"id": "flnygn", "title": "Friday Green or Red? [DD Inside]", "selftext": "Will keep this short. At this point everybody understands what quad witching is. The real question is how it applies to tomorrow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Basics of Max Pain**  \n>  \n>Max pain theory says that the option writers will hedge the contracts they have written. In the case of the market maker, the hedging is done to remain neutral in the stock. Consider the market maker's position if he must write an option contract without wanting a position in the stock.  \n>  \n>As the option expiration approaches, option writers will try to buy or sell shares of stock to drive the price toward a closing price that is profitable for them, or at least to hedge their payouts to option holders. **Call writers sell shares to drive share price down and Put holders buy shares to drive share price up. The max pain strike price exists somewhere in the middle.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMM will both be trying to push calls and puts to max pain, which for the SPY, is at $300. Call writers will sell shares in order to try to push price down. Put writers will buy shares in order to push the price up. Considering the recent drill over the past month:\n\nCall Writers Exposure: $81M\n\nPut Writers Exposure: **$14B**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cn8r099zvqn41.png?width=1154&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc0f3d7a7545d0024ae1d18127b51e7dfd7ca129\n\nI think its fairly obvious MM's with put liability will overpower those with call liability.\n\nMore DD?\n\nIn an absolutely devastating liquidity crunch, what a coincidence it is that the FED are reinstating the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) from '08, except now repayment terms on loans are no longer overnight, they are 90 days, and the FED has reduced restrictions on acceptable collateral to now include investment grade corporate debt securities, international agency securities, commercial paper, municipal securities, mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities; **plus equity securities.** This facility began ops at 9PM tonight and will run for at least the next 6 months.\n\nYes, California is on lock down and the virus is mutating, but none of that actually matters. This is simply market manipulation. Expect your regularly scheduled bear market next week.\n\n**TLDR:** SPY mooning tomorrow. I'm not saying it will open green, but these put writers will do anything in their power to reduce their exposure here before close, hence the name, witching hour.\n\n$SPY 270C 3/27 - flip the premium at close", "created_utc": 1584675178.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flnygn/friday_green_or_red_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
