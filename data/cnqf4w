{"id": "cnqf4w", "title": "$ATVI DD", "selftext": "Alright so I know this is Reddit and \"grrrr Activision bad, CD Projekt Red gud\" but hear me out for a second.\n\nIn 2014 World of Warcraft eclipsed 100 million lifetime players. Obviously that total number has gone up since then, but for sake of discussion lets go with the hypothetical scenario of 100 million dormant players, we'll write off any additional subscriber gains since 2014 as the currently actively playerbase(napkin math for sure, but I gotta catch a flight soon so whatever).\n\nWoW Classic is coming out soon and I think we are about to see something spectacular.\n\nLets say of this 100 million, 10% of those players decide to take a romp down memory lane and pick up a 3 month subscription. Furthermore, they need buy the current iteration of the game for it to work, and lets say for the heck of it maybe 25% of those players decide to actually try it out. Furthermore lets say 10% of those players that are playing the latest game decided to stick with it for bit, and pick up a character boost of their favorite class. Afterall, a lot of these people that used to play have will have more money than time, so paying $60 to not do a shit sucking grind is a bargain at that point.\n\nLets break it down line by line:\n\n* 3 month subscription = 10,000,000 x \\~$40 = $400,000,000\n* WoW BFA purchase(required for classic) = 10,000,000 x $50 = $500,000,000\n* Hypothetical character boosts = 250,000 x $60 = $15,000,000\n\nSo assuming a 10% reactivation rate we are looking at about $915,000,000 before tax and I dunno wtf their effective tax rate is so we'll say like $700,000,000. This is all for this quarter, from just from WoW, from reactivated players alone. Now I know there are a lot of other ways WoW milks their customers, but for simplicities sake I am going to ignore them for now any move on to my next point.\n\nWe now have a large influx of players re-engaging with blizzards platform. For funsies if 25% of them pick up another blizzard game at some point this quarter that will be another roughly $250,000,000 in $ATVI's pocket.\n\nMy expectations are this quarters earnings will match expectations or maybe even a moderate beat(starting to see players reactivate as the classic hype builds).\n\n# However I think there is going to be a BIG DICK GUIDANCE INCREASE.\n\nIf you've played earnings before, at this point you should know guidance is basically all that fucking matters.\n\nThis shit is going to the moon boys.", "created_utc": 1565291487, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cnqf4w/atvi_dd/", "is_self": true}
