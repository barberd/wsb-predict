As it is taking what it looks are it\u2019s final breaths, a door opens with a creaking sound and lo and behold, it is JPow with a briefcase in his hand. He walks slowly into the room and lays the briefcase down on the floor, wiping the sweat on his forehead as the camera slowly moves to show what\u2019s in that briefcase, a bunch of syringes.\n\nThe syringes all have different labels on them with 2 of them clearly visible that say Unlimited QE and Buying junk debt. He lifts his head up, looks at the bull and grabs as many syringes as he can in both hands with  no regard for what the labels say and proceeds to walk towards the bull.\n\nThe bull with its eyes half open, gathers enough energy to mutter the words \u201cPlease let me die! I can\u2019t do it anymore!\u201d With a sadistic grin on his face and the syringes in his hands aligned perfectly, JPow raises his right arm as high as he can and brings it down with all his might with the needles piercing the bull\u2019s skin and lodging into its flesh. As he proceeds to push the plungers of the syringes in, the bull\u2019s eyes turn blood red and it gathers enough energy to stand on its legs and mutters the words \u201cGive me more\u201d.\n\nHe passes the remaining syringes from his left hand to the right, and raises his arm with his jaw clenched and eyes wide open. As he\u2019s about to bring it down again, the scene cuts to a boxing arena packed with obese 18 years olds with Tendies in one hand and a can of Mountain Dew in another, chanting the words \u201cPUMP IT! PUMP IT! PUMP IT!\u201d at the screens streaming JPOW and the bull from the room next to the arena. The camera slowly moves into the boxing ring to reveal an adolescent bear cluelessly looking around as if he doesn\u2019t know where he is or what he\u2019s doing.\n\nBack in the dark room, as he\u2019s standing beside the bull in awe of its newfound strength, JPOW answers a call to hear the voice on the other end say \u201cIt\u2019s time to bring him out JAY\u201d.\n\nTLDR: I need to stop browsing this sub and fucking around and do some actual work or I\u2019m gonna be fired soon.
