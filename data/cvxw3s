To fill an underlying gambling addiction, some bullshit dd before yoloing into some nonsense is really just gambling anyway. \n\nBut I pretend to do my DD like everyone else, and find myself sitting with a mostly cash portfolio because I legitimately only fuck with options on robinhood. And I just need to scratch that fucking itch. It\u2019s been a long day, and the markets are closed. It\u2019s 2 am. You gotta do something. \n\nFuck it. $1400 in BTC. Right in robinhood. Check back in 20 minute, you might have made $40 bucks, you might be down $100. Sleep on it and wake up and only have $1100, who knows? Certainly not me, I\u2019m still not even sure how bitcoin even works. \n\nEither way. Thank god Robinhood gives me the option to lose some money anytime of day.", "created_utc": 1566871737, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cvxw3s/unpopular_opinion_robinhood_crypto_investing_is/", "is_self": true}
