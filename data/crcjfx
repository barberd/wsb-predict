{"id": "crcjfx", "title": "This weeks notes (8/12/19 - 8/16/19)", "selftext": "SNAPSHOT: Equities up, Treasuries down, Dollar down, Crude up.\n\nREAR VIEW: China, Germany hint at stimulus; OPEC MOMR downgrades 2019 demand growth view; Trump says he is to speak with Xi; mixed starts/permits data; Michigan sentiment weak; Kashkari says economic signals are mixed, but Mester did not seem overly concerned.\n\nWEEK AHEAD: \n* MON: Japanese Trade Balance, EZ CPI. \n* TUE: Swiss Trade Balance, German PPI, Norwegian GDP, Canadian Manufacturing Sales, RBA Minutes. \n* WED: Norwegian Unemployment, South African CPI, Canadian CPI, US Existing Home Sales, FOMC Minutes. \n* THU: EZ &amp; US Manufacturing, Services and Composite PMIs, Swedish Unemployment, EZ Consumer Confidence, NZ Retail Sales, ECB Minutes. \n* FRI: Japanese National CPI, Canadian Retail Sales, US New Home Sales.* \n\n\n#MARKETS WRAP:\nSentiment was more constructive on Friday, following US President Trump's remarks on Tuesday, where he stated that he and China President Xi are set to hold a telephone call; traders note that calls between the two leaders tend to lead to a thawing in relations, if history is anything to go by. Additionally, calls for more stimulus out of Europe, and stimulus measures announced by China also offered support.\n\n\n* TRADE WAR: US President Trump on Thursday said he was scheduled to hold a call regarding trade with China President Xi \"very soon\", adding that the US has had \"productive\" and \"very good talks with China.\" Trump also said China wants to make a trade deal, and the trade war will be fairly short.\n\n\n* CHINA: Chinese state planners said that it will roll out measures to boost disposable income this year and in 2020 in order to encourage consumption amid the slowdown in the economy. China's Cabinet said it will use market-based reforms to lower real interest rates, and will ensure average funding costs for small businesses fall by 1ppt. The Cabinet also said it will step up support for companies that have orders and credibility, adding that China will continue reforms, and improve lending interest rate formation mechanism.\n\n\n* GERMANY: The German government is said to be preparing deficit spending in the case that Germany enters recession, according to Spiegel. The move to scrap the \"black zero\" principle could potentially come with political costs. Merkel's CDU party would be dropping a massive selling point to voters and its party base who see a balanced budget as a sensible economic policy when faced with fiscal challenges from an aging population, OxEco analysts said. However, voices within the SPD (the CDU/CSU coalition partner) are challenging how prudent a balanced budget is.\n\n\n* US UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN: The headline fell to a seven-month low at 92.1 from 98.4 (consensus 97.0). \"The drop in the index was driven by the expectations component, which is sensitive to sudden moves in the stock market. The index dropped by 8.2 points to 82.3, which is still a very respectable reading but the lowest since January, when it was depressed by the Q4 drop in stocks,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics said, noting that the current conditions index slipped only 3.3 points, to 107.4; \"it's mostly driven by jobless claims, which aren\u2019t moving much. Confidence remains high but a sustained decline in stocks would do real damage; that\u2019s contingent mostly on developments on the trade front, as far as we can tell.\" Meanwhile, there was an uptick in inflation expectations, though within recent ranges.\n\n\n* US BUILDING PERMITS/HOUSING STARTS: Mixed data, where housing starts missed, though building permits beat. Starts fell to 1.191mln from 1.241mln, missing expectations of a rise to 1.257mln. The 4% monthly decline is the third consecutive fall, driven by multifamily homes (-16.2%, having already fallen 16.4% in June). Permits were stronger, rising to 1.336mln from 1.232mln, and beating expectations for a rise to 1.270mln. Wells Fargo notes that most of the weakness in multifamily starts was in the Northeast, a region with a strong level of apartment buildings. However, it believes that this shows the apartment market is topping out, particularly in the Northeast and Western parts as they are more exposed to slowing global growth.\n\n\n* NORTH KOREA: North Korea state media said the country will never talk to South Korean officials again, in response to South Korea President Moon\u2019s speech on unification by 2045; the pariah state is irritated by US/South Korea military drills, which it has previously framed as 'practice for an invasion'. It was also reported that North Korea fired two projectiles to the East Sea.\n\n\n* CANADA: Canadian Government is to give dairy farmers CAD 1.75bln over eight years, in compensation for EU and Trans-pacific trade deals, and Canada said that it will not give up further dairy market access concessions in future USMCA negotiations.\n\n\n* IRAN: The Iranian tankers which was held in Gibraltar for allegedly breaching EU sanctions, was reportedly on the move out of Gibraltar waters, although there was some talk that it might be subject to a last minute bid by the US to seize the tanker. The US State Dept on Friday said the ship was aiding Iran's Revolutionary Guard, and threatened to sanctions crew members.\n\n\n* FED: Fed's Kashkari (non-voter, dove) said signals from the economy are mixed right now; businesses are spooked by the trade wars. He said that a recession was not his base case scenario, though he admitted that risks have risen a bit. Kashkari argued that the Fed needs to pull-back on rates, and probably needs to provide more support to the economy, adding that it was better to be early and aggressive in response to a slowdown. Fed\u2019s Mester (non-voter, hawk) said she would have preferred to hold US rates constant in July but it was a 'close call', says the salient question is whether to cut rates or keep them steady. She can see scenarios where rates are steady or moved lower. On the yield curve, she said it is hard to read a strong signal, but said that US economic risks are weighted to the downside. Mester, who usually errs hawkish, said sometimes holding pat on rates is tightening policy, but nevertheless, it Fed needs to take time to assess economic conditions and then move policy as appropriate. She acknowledged that the US economy is slowing, but not in the same situation as the global economy, aruing that the US economy will likely to grow around trend, with inflation rising to fed target, but there are risks. She is not as concerned about inflation as some on the Fed's rate-setting committee, and noted that trade policy uncertainty is having an impact on business sentiment.\n\n\n* US T-NOTE FUTURES SETTLE 1 TICK LOWER AT 130-29+. There was a steepening bias amid risk-on trade, extending Thursday\u2019s steepening, as hints of fiscal stimulus and positive noises from US President Trump on trade helped yields rise after the stellar rally this week, which has seen US 10-year yields fall below 1.60%, and the long-end fall sub 2.0% (though the latter is above that mark at settlement on Friday). Housing data was mixed, but investors focussed on the building permits beat rather than the housing starts miss, and yields saw upticks in wake of the data. There was, however, stabilisation after a grim University of Michigan sentiment report. The Treasury curve took influence from Bunds in afternoon trade, after reports that the Germans were considering jettisoning its balanced budget objective if Germany falls into recession; the growth supportive approach helped Bund yields to rise, with Treasuries moving in sympathy, though the moves were pared back as trade lightened as traders headed for the exits for the week. Next week, the yield curve may refocus on more Fedspeak, with FOMC minutes and Jackson Hole on the slate.\u00a0\n\n\n* FX WRAP: The more constructive risk tone weighed on havens CHF, JPY and XAU. EUR continued trade lower after ECB's Rehn on Thursday called for a big bazooka at the September meeting, but launched back to flattish levels just under 1.11 on reports that the German government could blow its balanced budget goal if the country enters recession. GBP is the darling among major FX this week, rising as lawmakers conspire to prevent PM Johnson from leading the UK out of the EU without the backing of MPs, helping GBP to retain the 1.2150 mark. CAD saw some support from House Ways and Means ranking member Kevin Brady suggesting there is a desire to pass the USMCA this year, and trades beneath 1.33 heading into the weekend; MXN saw limited upside on the news, although gains have been capped after Thursday's surprise Banxico cut. BRL was also lagging the EMFX complex, with traders citing President Bolsonaro's threats to pull out of the Mercosur trade pact if Argentine primary leader Fernandez wins the Presidency. TRY was also lagging after a Kremlin spokesperson said Russia and Turkey were working on the second stage of the S-400 missile system delivery, which will not be received well in Washington; the slide in oil prices was also said to be contributing. The NZD was under pressure after overnight data showed manufacturing PMI falling into contraction territory; the downside helped to support AUDNZD, helping AUD to trade slightly positive vs the USD.

Although OPEC crude production fell 246k BPD in June to 29.61mln BPD, according to secondary sources, it sees oil demand growth at around 1.10mln BPD in 2019, down 40k BPD from the prior report, while the forecast for 2020 indicates growth of around 1.14mln BPD Y/Y (unchanged from prior report). Crude oil output decreased mostly in Saudi Arabia, Libya, Iran, Venezuela and Nigeria, while production in Iraq and Algeria increased. Analysts said that OPEC's current production of 29.6mln BPD represents a around 700k BPD under-supply relative to the expected 2019 call on OPEC, and a 200k BPD oversupply relative to the expected 2020 call. The OPEC reports aligns itself with both the IEA OMR and EIA STEO in regard to downgrades in 2019 global oil demand growth forecasts in which the former cut its forecast by 100k BPD to 1.1mln BPD and the latter by 70k BPD to 1.0mln BPD. However, 2020 global oil demand growth between the three-monthly reports diverge, i.e. OPEC left its 2020 outlook unchanged, at 1.14mln BPD. IEA cut its 2020 forecast by 50k BPD to 1.3mln BPD and EIA raised its outlook by 30k BPD to 1.43mln BPD.\n\n\n* WTI (V9) SETTLES USD 0.40 HIGHER AT USD 54.87/BBL; BRENT (V9) SETTLES USD 0.41 HIGHER AT USD 58.64/BBL: Oil is on the front-foot, likely taking its cue from overall risk sentiment, which has been constructive after US President Trump Thursday said he is due to have telephone conversation with China President Xi on trade soon. Additionally, there are increasing murmurs form China and Germany about actual and potential fiscal stimulus, respectively, which is likely to help support the downside. However, crude trades off highs, knocked after the OPEC's latest MOMR, where it lowered 2019 demand forecasts. \"This report was really just a variation on an established theme, however, with similar adjustments to last week\u2019s DOE and International Energy Agency forecasts,\" Citi said, \"as with the other reports, the lower demand outlook was offset by a 72k BPD downward revision to non-OPEC supply on slowing US production growth, while a 0.25mln BPD decline in OPEC production to 29.61mln BPD also contributed to a market that looks tighter overall than a month ago.\" This week, Baker Hughes reported North American rigs rose by 1 in the week, to 935; oil rigs were +6 at 770 , gas rigs fell by 4 to 165.\n\n\n* SPX +1.5% at 2889, Dow +12% at 25887, NDZ +1.6% at 7604; Sectors: consumer discretionary+1.1%, consumer strapless +1.1%, energy +1.2%, financials +1.9%, health care +1.2%, industrials +1.9%, IT +1.9%, materials +1.8%, telecoms +1.2%, utilities +0.4%.", "created_utc": 1565989796, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/crcjfx/this_weeks_notes_81219_81619/", "is_self": true}
