Just for some nostalgia and to fuck around with 2k I had laying around\n\nNow here\u2019s the thing, unlike most platforms SimpleFX carries a few crypto currencies (BTC, ETH, LTC, XRP to name a few) to play around with, and after seeing crypto climb recently I decided to drop most of funds into BTC &amp; ETH, while not giving a single shit if I got liquidated. \n\nI placed some orders with leverages around midnight, got bored watching cryptoholics attempt to pump the price, passed out for a bit, and woke up to a total shitstorm. The price of BTC &amp; ETH pumps about 11% in 4 hours (crypto market moves together, fucking coins can\u2019t think for themselves), and I wake up to a wallet that\u2019s doubled in size. \n\nGreat, now let\u2019s do that 4-5x again and throw Litecoin\u2019s bitch ass in the trades until the account reaches about $18,000 over the next 12 days. Thanks to a good litecoin pump, my account grew as I swing traded my ass around the clock. \n\nTo whoever said \u201cWhat goes up, must come down\u201d, I hope your life is as big a joke as your 401k, fuck you. Those words made me think \u201cWell crypto has pumped long enough, probably won\u2019t last much longer\u201d and my dumb ass decided to place an order on TSLA in the morning.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing with small trading platforms like SimpleFX, they\u2019re trying to make trading as easy as can be for newbies, so placing a large buy order and forgetting to decrease the leverage amount is an easy thing to do just out of reflex. \n\nNow here\u2019s where I fucked up. You usually trade crypto in amounts of .27 or .97 because you usually don\u2019t buy the whole fucking thing unless the coin is cheap, but the platform doesn\u2019t allow that with stocks like TSLA or AAPL. The amount \u201c.65\u201d was auto saved from my last BTC trade, along with the high leverage, but I \u201cthought\u201d that I had changed the amount as I was mainly using TradingView.com to predict future movements and use shitty analysis techniques that I\u2019ve learned over the years. \n\nAfter confidently betting that TSLA would go up for reasons that I don\u2019t fucking know anymore, I placed a buy order for an amount of 65 on TSLA, THINKING that I only placed an order for 10. The \u201c.65\u201d from my last btc trade had the period removed as you can\u2019t buy a fraction of a stock. My cocky ass then went to make some coffee, eat some breakfast, and after an hour of morning bullshit I came back to an empty account. The leverage I had unknowingly set was beyond what my account could handle after TSLA took a dip, and the entire fucking thing was wiped clean. \n\nIn panic, I messaged support (which was amazingly immediate, kudos to them) and they described the situation about my trade settings aka my leverages and the amount I purchased. \n\nNow, I sit here, mourning my $18k loss while hoping one of you fuckers learn to stay away from small platforms, don\u2019t get cocky when trading, and always check your order amounts &amp; leverages. \n\nDon\u2019t fuck up, -P", "created_utc": 1559532391, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bw620p/how_i_turned_2000_into_17800_in_2_weeks_and_lost/", "is_self": true}
