Who doesn't want that? Well if you do I have the play for you! First let's catch you up to speed on this 2 week old post, which if you would have followed me, you to would be enjoying over 800% gains at this point.\n\n[Original DD Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7ifvr/cornerstone_ondemand_csdo_dd_undervalued_gem_in_a/)\n\n**but wait there's more!**\n\n> Private reports of the SABA acquisition in relation to CSOD's overall revenue forecast a 25-33% increase, this will officially be detailed in Q1 earnings report.\n\n> SABA has a very large clientele base which is apt for cross-selling $CSOD's exisiting products\n\n> CSOD is mostly institutional buys. They are looking for safe-havens in this risky environment, $CSOD has a HUGE cash flow. Cash is king in a recession. They are also primarily catering to essential employees, their cash flow will not be as affected. SABA acquisition also represents a large percentage increase in free cash flow.\n\n> CSOD already has most of its annualized returns locked in due to contracts and will be able to provide stable, if not forward-looking guidance.\n\n> [Please see this additional comment DD, holy fucking shit just buy calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7ifvr/cornerstone_ondemand_csdo_dd_undervalued_gem_in_a/folrklv/)\n\nSo what we have here is a undervalued, heavily hit company during the crash which has yet to make it's checkmark recovery like so many other stocks. What's difference?\n\nWell people are now finally realizing how strong the tech sector is, and how valuable remotely-engaged businesses will be in the future. This pandemic just caused a paradigm shift in how humans will work in the future, companies like $CSOD will profit from this immensely in the next 2-4 quarters which investors will EAT UP.\n\nNow let me answer some questions that I frequently see...\n\n> *hurr durrr I saw the executives selling shares?* well yeah no shit, they were about to announce an acquisition which usually tanks share prices short-term. The next time they sold was the actual market crash, who wouldn't?\n\n> *but what if this is another NET?* $CSOD is still significantly down from its share price before the crash and acquisition. Once we see how the new acquisition will help CSOD in the medium-term, institutions will be eating this stock up for its MASSIVE FREE CASH FLOW. Also this is mostly institutional buyers, this ain't a meme stock (except now it is...)\n\n> *how are you sure they beat?* if you take a look at the current expectations for Q1, they are relatively low in a quarter where all of America, and the World was sent into lockdown resulting in a MASSIVE shift to online-based learning, trainings and work. I believe they beat handily and their SABA acquisition models are icing on the cake for the BREAKOUT OF THE CENTURY.\n\n> *is it to late to join the party?* no but you now have to account for IV, don't pick retardly OTM 5/15 calls, stick to 6/19s at strikes $40 or $42.5, maybe $45 for a daytrade.\n\n> *when are you selling?* I bet my short-term livelihood on this play, I can't leave it all on the table and will take some profits EOD Monday. I will be remaining in a $5k-$7.5k long-term play for earnings. Literally I bet my savings on this shit.\n\nI am glad my first $DD has been so profitable for so many, and I hope it continues to pay y'all out, it sure has for me. I can't wait to see what is in store on Monday night. What's next? Find out this weekend on another edition of Baked Morning.\n\nGood luck, and may your portfolio finally go green.\n\nTLDR: avoid IV, stick with June 19 $37.50c / $40c / $42.50c as many as you can buy.", "created_utc": 1588940252.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfs575/baked_morning_cornerstone_ondemand_csod_how_did/", "is_self": true}
