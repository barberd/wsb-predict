A bull is a buyer who fights by striking up with its horns and capitalizing on rising prices. A bear on the other hand is a seller and fights by striking down with its claws to capitalize of declining prices. Hogs are greedy, they get slaughtered when they trade to satisfy their greed. Some hogs buy or sell positions that are too large for them and get destroyed by a small adverse move. Other hogs over stay their positions, they keep waiting for profits to get bigger and get depleted when the trend reverses. \n                                       \n                                               -Dr. Alexander Elder", "created_utc": 1566325282, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ct3iqf/are_you_the_bull_the_bear_or_the_hog/", "is_self": true}
