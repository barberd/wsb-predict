{"id": "e8pdha", "title": "Thoughts on $GME", "selftext": "I just did an online test to prove I am not retarded, so hear me out: \n\nAs all of you probably know $GME will report earnings AMC today.\n\nI've been trying to look into it and see how things are going for $GME. Everyone knows that things are not going well as everyone is buying games online and not on a physical disk anymore. They have contacted a consulting firm and restructured their management team. Now, they are looking to aggressively \"reboot\" Gamestop as they call it.\n\nEveryone is expecting earnings to miss which will likely happen. But, I think it will not be as bad as everyone is thinking. CFO, James Bell, said that they were able to boost sales in early November due to Fortnite. They've also partnered with Activision for the release of the new COD that came out. Furthermore, they are closing stores and were able to cut 4% of their costs last quarter, only expecting them to close more and cut more costs.\n\nThe biggest thing in my mind though is that 80% of the stock is shorted making a potential short squeeze on just slightly good guidance possible. I think the risk/reward here is just too good as everyone is $GME expecting to miss and lower guidance, but if they by any chance raise guidance I'm sure the stock will jump 40%.\n\nLet me know what you're thinking my retarded brothers", "created_utc": 1575976769, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e8pdha/thoughts_on_gme/", "is_self": true}
