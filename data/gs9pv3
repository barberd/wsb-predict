{"id": "gs9pv3", "title": "ITCI round two, and this time, no one is paying attention (IV expansion play)", "selftext": "TLDR: June 19 25 strike has intense OI, but low IV. It's right before data drop so MM will boost IV to take an implied move of 10 points into account. \n\nHey folks, \n\nLately, I noticed that ITCI has been getting some massive inflows from hedgefunds, which is much more than the outflows for the other biotech stocks that are on my radar and more so than before their schizo drug got approved by the FDA: ([https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ITCI/institutional-ownership/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ITCI/institutional-ownership/)).\n\nNow, there are two upcoming catalysts for ITCI, but it seems like no one is actually paying attention except the hedgie boys who have locked up a lot of shares. ITCI has two upcoming catalysts: first, their schizo drug Lumateperone also has phase 3 data coming out for bipolar disorder. Second, they're about to release data on their other molecule (ITI-214)  that acts as PDE-1 inhibitor. Surprisingly, despite the fact that it is released on their website that data drop will be this month and that there is a huge inflow from hedgefunds/call volume on 25 strike, no one seems to be actually paying attention to this move. Jeffries has a 35 dollar price target if both catalysts play out well. \n\nThe implied volatility on these options is simply too low to account for two catalysts (especially the bipolar data as it's a phase 3 trial). This is quite surprising as ITCI garnered a lot of attention the last time it had a catalyst. It might be because people are not paying attention, but overall, the hedgefunds have all loaded up. I'm loading these ones up as a hype play since IV gradually increases the closer the options get to the catalyst.", "created_utc": 1590684182.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gs9pv3/itci_round_two_and_this_time_no_one_is_paying/", "is_self": true}
