It\u2019s pretty easy to understand, the chart  reflects the percentage return of the Dow Jones Industrial Average over the three major secular market cycles of the last 100 years (maybe I could/should have gone back further than 100 yrs. whatever, fuck off). My technical analysis is relatively simple (I only had to draw one arrow as opposed to adding three or four random lines like some of y\u2019all like try to do to look smart) but it\u2019s EXTREMELY powerful. If you look at the line/arrow closely and for long enough you might actually notice that STOCKS LITERALLY ONLY FUCKING GO UP.", "created_utc": 1582387508, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7ufzt/listen_up_stocks_literally_only_go/", "is_self": true}
