You can tell he utilized every one of his 47 chromosomes to write it because it is pretty retarded and lacks any real point. His DD is questionable and he has absolutely 0 skin in the game. Here is the article, if you want to leave dumber, take a look.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbhwqk/purple\\_prpl\\_reasons\\_to\\_be\\_short/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbhwqk/purple_prpl_reasons_to_be_short/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Van Dam Making a move](https://preview.redd.it/fcu8x3hwnq551.png?width=326&format=png&auto=webp&s=4439913c31ac47474f2fdd0707fe92a0f99e86cd)\n\nFirst of all- In summary, he claimed that a handful of us own a massive portion of the outstanding shares, he claimed there have been dilutive offerings and he claimed that the run up was almost certainly because of this forum. There were also claims that small purchases will move the price of the stock drastically.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# I would advise against going short for the following reasons:\n\n* Institutional ownership is a good thing- brings big players to the table that can stabilize the stock. Also his float numbers were pulled from 15 different sites. **INSTITUTIONAL OWNERSHIP IS GOOD, it means smart educated firms are investing.**\n* **T*****his guy literally has no position***, other than bent over on his Casper mattress and let's be honest, it's as uncomfortable for us as it is for him. I will sell him puts, that is how confident I am. I have sold more than 500 PUT contracts. See below. I**f he wants to make some money he should buy some puts or actually short the stock. Mr. VanDam, Tell me which expiration and strikes and I'll be there for you. If these puts are to be called I would need to come up with nearly 650K.**\n* &#x200B;\n\n[My Current PUT contracts](https://preview.redd.it/om2bmshpgq551.jpg?width=1117&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=edcf78842b4ef5407245696efdd6d3f72cf6b5ad)\n\n* There are 54M shares outstanding of which \\~33M are publicly traded.\n   * &#x200B;\n\n[Float Size](https://preview.redd.it/rsxg1t98nq551.jpg?width=1345&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ad31c04191cab92b1e85ded9215a69ad179f238)\n\n* I do not own shares, I own warrants, this is the right to buy shares that have not yet been issued.\n* There have been 2 offerings NONE OF THE OFFERINGS HAVE BEEN DILUTIVE, THEY HAVE BEEN OFFERINGS from the founders, they took shares that already existed and registered them for public sale. Please read this statement on the filing. The owners converted class B (private) shares and converted them  on 1:1 for class A shares. **PURPLE DID NOT RECEIVE A DIME from this SALE** and the float remained the same, with more of it being available to the public.\n\n[Registration statement claiming no proceeds from sale are going to purple.](https://preview.redd.it/qu09zec6iq551.jpg?width=769&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d2c52a9a1ac1efe1565404bb978572e7aa3e37b1)\n\n* See Capital Structure\n   * Class b shares were exchanged 1:1 for public class A shares.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f2i5sskcnq551.jpg?width=743&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cc350f039f178a8abca04c0d802b1e762654ba37\n\n* There are insinuations that a small 10K share transaction will artificially move the stock price. There were nearly 900K shares that traded hands (nearly 18M dollars of transactions) The stock went up 1 cent. Need I say more? Today alone, there was a transaction\n\n[Volume, and market CAP](https://preview.redd.it/rf1kh0buiq551.jpg?width=809&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3f808b588b901f265a373f5e9c5da1460af6f8f)\n\n* I pulled some level 2 Option data to show you tards that the stock movement and option movement are very unlikely to be single individuals. \n   * There are several transactions in the tens of thousands of dollars. See level 2 data\n   * There were transactions with more than 20K shares changing hands in a single purchase.\n\n[Stock Transactions](https://preview.redd.it/k20r6r6lmq551.jpg?width=831&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=25fdecd2bc6799575367a95f9421e64ef777c9bb)\n\n[some transactions are more than 30K dollars](https://preview.redd.it/yz0bjqk3mq551.jpg?width=694&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6aeca5b2d6e9e5bb13ffb9f61460b90a46142f87)\n\n* Purple YOY performance has been great.

Currently purple is in about 1800 stores, in the USA alone there are nearly 30,000 stores.
