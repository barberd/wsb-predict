Yesterday many of you autists made much money and had much fun with a post I made about a chad robot from the future here to bring you tendies.  While I'm not going to comment on the veracity of a number of claims impugning my character, my status as a chad, or the flaccid diameter of my butthole.  I am going to tell you why I was doing that. Also, I didn't make money of off yesterdays post, so if any of you fucks made a ten bagger opting in with 100 grand, feel free to tip your waiter.\n\n\nDD? Doesn't matter.  It mattered a few weeks ago. It usually matters.  Right now it does not, because fundamentals don't apply to bubbles.   What matters right now is three things.  Stock *accessibility*, *perceived discount*, and *fomo*.\n\n\nI used a lot of big words there, I know, I feel like a goddamned incel already.  Let's keep going.\n\nRobinhood helpfully lists the top stocks owned by Robinhood investors.  Why is this helpful right now?  Because this is a Robinhood market.  This is not a 7% annualized return 6th year of Barack Obama's bloomberg market.  This is a redbull, lets get wasted, cargo shorts are a valid fashion choice market.  It's being led around the bullpen by retail buyers with dim urges leading them on like a 14 year old who just broke both of his arms and mom is looking at him in that *special way*\n\nHere, before I lose my nerve, is the chart.\n\n\n:TICKER|:STOCK PRICE:|BUY RATING:\n\nVAL | $2.75 | 0%\n\nWLL | $3.98 | 0%\n\nHTZ | $6.83 | 0%\n\nNKLA | $89.35 | NUL%\n\nDNR | $.86 | 0%\n\nThese stocks, on average, went up 150% today.  The poorest stock on the list went up 135%, the best 195.70%\n\nDid you notice something else?  *I* fucking did.  **ALL OF THEM HAVE 0% BUY RATINGS**\n\nI'll let you draw your own conclusions.  Conclusions don't matter, But   this is how I accurately predicted 6 stocks yesterday and made anyone stupid enough to follow my shitpost a fuck ton of money.\n\n\nAsk yourself 3 questions when buying a stock.\n\n1. Is it *accessible*.  Can I buy a lot of this stock if I have a grand that I just shoved into Robinhood because I lost my job and yelling at the dog in a wifebeater isn't fun anymore.  Best picks are stocks priced at less than 10 bucks.\n\n2. Is at available at a *discount*.  Is this stock on sale, Becky?  I love to bargain hunt!  Look at pre-covid charts, look at charts in the nowtime.  Is it 25% off?  BUY THAT SHIT\n\n3. Did it spike a bit yesterday?  Not too much.  But a pump?\nHOLY FUCK I'D BETTER NOT MISS OUT.\n\nFundamentals don't matter. Covid doesn't matter. Riots don't matter.  This is a bubble.  Same as the last one and the one before that.  Fortunes are made in bubbles.  This advice will be worthless in two weeks, but right now. BUY.\n\nPositions, because fuck you I already did my reseach.\n\nCAKE couple bucks OTM, two weeks expiration.\n\nPLAY same thing\n\nIVR same thing\n\nTWO same thing\n\nFMCIW buy and hold for a few months.\n\nDKNG before DKNG was rich.\n\nDGLY this isn't true of this stock anymore, but it was yesterday, which is why the gay robot told you to buy it.  It's not massively  cheap anymore. Same with NKLA.  They may very well continue to explode, but they don't follow the formula so I'm out\n\n\nAS I SAID YESTERDAY, DO NOT FUCKING FOLLOW THIS ACVICE, IT WOULD BE RETARDED IN THE EXTREME.  YOU MAY ALSO SCORE A 10 BAGGER.\n\nIf you're playing anything right now, and you're looking at this post, I know you're glued to your robinhood accounts at all times during trading hours.  That's good.  Go make your fucking money.  But if you see a bear flag form in any major index over the course of two days go FUCKING CASH for a minute.", "created_utc": 1591678319.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gzg8he/the_market_is_a_coke_fueled_after_party_and/", "is_self": true}
