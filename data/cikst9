Did some lurking around on their website and they have some atrociously bad promotional videos, but their products actually seem kind of amazing.  With other memory/chip stocks starting to recover (MU for one, XLNX sold off but some price target upgrades and looks good to soar), this company is looking pretty beaten down when not too long ago it had some positive reviews and outlook.\n\nThey are having issues with finding new customers as the process is lengthy and highly competitive, with no guarantee of a payout if they don\u2019t get the design win.  They recently lost a big customer and had to drum up funds with a 0.30/share public offering which is why they\u2019ve been hurting so bad, and look like they\u2019re going to do a reverse split or even get bought out soon due to their low share price and lack of funding.\n\nOn the plus side they have a new product line (bandwidth engine 3) that is supposed to start generating revenue \u201clate 2019\u201d according to a press release from August 2018.  Reading their financial reports paints a pretty bleak picture of a company with good products struggling to find customers and running out of money, so it seems like literally any positive news will make them moon.  For .19c a share it seems like a low risk bet.", "created_utc": 1564250944, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cikst9/anyone_looking_at_mosy/", "is_self": true}
