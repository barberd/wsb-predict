{"id": "g1sbdb", "title": "$COST Play: DD Inside", "selftext": "Disclaimer as always - I work for a Costco Business Partner. I am familiar with their practices, it's my largest holding, and I know the company backward are forwards. Nothing about my information is insider information, but I do get a unique view inside the ticking clock. Please check my post history as I have successfully and unsuccessfully posted my trades regarding Costco.\n\nPlay - Sell the 322.5C - 5/8.\n\nThe broader market is rising due to the FED pumping, but headcount is down in all Costco's across the nation. Foot traffic is lower in every warehouse and if you go during the day outside of California on a weekday, you will see almost an eerie atmosphere.\n\nReason for the strikes, May 6th is Costco's April Sales data. We are going to start seeing negative MoM sales data. Additionally, 5% at grocery stores right now with Chase Freedom is my autistic level DD as well.\n\nI have enough shares to sell this covered. But I recommend credit spreads if not. This is not going to hit 322.5-330 range after April's sales data.\n\nP.S. Shortly after this post, someone basically did a market order on this strike and drove the price down 2.00. So thank you for your retardation.", "created_utc": 1586958758.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1sbdb/cost_play_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
