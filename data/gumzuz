They just bought the rights to Adderall which all you degenerates LOVE. Theyve been around since the 1780's so they were slinging pharmaceuticals back in the day to the Jeffersons and the Washingtons. They are Japans LARGEST pharmaceutical company in Japan, have multiple partners in countless countries, and profits are set to TRIPLE this year. Its currently trading a little above $19 a share and with 10 to 20 cent options on long dated calls AND a corona vaccine in the works for trials beginning in July. They will supply the vaccine on the other side of the world and with Trump pissing everyone off you can bet Takeda will pick up some more business.\n\nTLDR: 25c 10/16, 30c 1/15/21, 25c 1/15/21, 30c 6/18/21\n\nThis is the only pharma stock ive been able to find with cheap options that hasnt popped yet and with a little DD you'll see the upside potential.", "created_utc": 1591026633.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gumzuz/tak_options_cheaper_than_a_street_corner_bj/", "is_self": true}
