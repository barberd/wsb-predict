After seeing domino's and STMP jumps, I have been digging into some possible meme stock for r/wsb  It seems like DBX has a real chance to jump tomorrow. \n\nI did some research and found this: \n\n **The 12 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for Dropbox Inc have a median target of 30.00, with a high estimate of 37.00 and a low estimate of 19.00. The median estimate represents a +63.13% increase from the last price of 18.39.** \n\nI was shocked after seeing this rating. \" High estimate of 37\"?\n\nThe calls right now are really cheap, like few cents cheap for a long call.\n\nI bought 10 shares, and I am thinking about getting some calls like 25c march. Literally free money to get if they do well later.", "created_utc": 1582210557, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6u75f/dbx_earning_call_play/", "is_self": true}
