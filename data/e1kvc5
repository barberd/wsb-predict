{"id": "e1kvc5", "title": "HP and Bestbuy earnings this week both seem to have some similarities in strengths and weakness (Discussion)", "selftext": "So Bestbuy and HP reports earnings tomorrow, I am considering going in on calls. The theory behind my approach is the following:\n\n1. Bestbuy lowered guidance because of uncertainty over tarifs making the bar much lower for this quarter. \n2. Competitors seem to be doing well and raising guidance so I think they might backtrack and do the same\n3. Home construction is on the rise this past quarter. This probably means appliance purchases will see a moderate boost which Bestbuy can get a piece of    \n\n\nAs for HP. This is honestly the gamble for me. Digitization is making printers less needed so there should be a decline. I think they might beat this earnings or have good news to show is the fact they rejected Xerox takeover bid as too low which is higher than what the share price is. This is even after Xerox threatened to go to shareholders directly. The fact that they are willing to play hardball makes me believe that this quarter will be a good quarter and the company believes the shareholders will vote in their favor   \n\n\nBoth of the theories are quite undeveloped. I would appreciate some insight.", "created_utc": 1574708902, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e1kvc5/hp_and_bestbuy_earnings_this_week_both_seem_to/", "is_self": true}
