The death rate number given by WHO is not demonstrative of whats happening right now The death rate is at least 4 times higher than what they say. You believe when Trumpy say everything is under control ? WRONG! On march 3 WHO declared the death ratio to be at [3.4%](https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---3-march-2020) and its true if you calculate the ratio of number of death by the number of case on that same day. \n\nOn march 3 they're were **93016 case confirmed** and **3202 death** that brings the death ratio to about 3,44%. BUT ITS WRONG ! Nobody dies of the beer flu the same day they gets it. I searched and didn't find anything relevant but my guess is that people die about 21 days after being infected. If thats true we are truly fucked. I read some post here that already said that the death ratio was not calculated correctly so I did it myself. \n\nHERE HOW IT IS CALCULATED\n\ndeath (x) / number of case (y) \n\nHERE HOW IT SHOULD BE CALCULATED\n\ndeath (x) / number of case (y) - time to die (T)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow here is a table I made with the correct percentage of death if it take 21 / 14 / 10 / 7 days to die (T). Those numbers are world-widely but I'm sure America is worst than that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[COVID-19 Cases](https://preview.redd.it/t3ukt5dnvxp41.png?width=1700&format=png&auto=webp&s=032ecc48a8f7dc43c30249e21cf51fd8cca23556)\n\nFor all the autism here that are scared by that shit load of number just check the two red circle I draw on there. The first one is my false calculation of the death rate which is  the official number published by WHO on march 3. The second circle is the death rate calculated as of march 30 with the correct way of calculating this thing. The other red number is the false death rate calculation of march 30\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo the if the averages of days to die is about 13 days wich is very optimistic in terms of that kind of data because the lower (T) is the lower the percentage it will be. The death rate of COVID-19 is **19,36%** about **4 times more what is currently told**. \n\nNow the question is when government will realize that? I dont't know and maybe never. \n\nMy position SPY 220P  04/17 bought at the peak of course so i will loose all my money.\n\nEdit: I know that there is a considerable amount of people who have the virus that have not been tested. This fact has nothing to do with my numbers as i'm just talking about the fact that the fatality calculation is wrong.\n\nThe 19% on worldometer is also not the same calculation made here but it just reenforce the fact that this is worst than what is currently said by the leaders. \n\nFinally THESE ARE NOT 100% RELIABLE NUMBERS JUST A QUICK OVERVIEW OF WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING WITH THE DATA FROM WORLD O METER.", "created_utc": 1585631277.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fs6wbv/the_official_given_numbers_are_wrong_covid19/", "is_self": true}
