The CEO sold 455,667 shares  (all but 1,000 beneficially owned) on 2/28 at a price of $34.49 for a total of $15,715,954.83! This guy is going to outdo Fortune 500 CEOs this year and he runs a fucking microcap.\n\nEven the lower-level directors made out like bandits with everybody exercising ALL their options with strikes between $1.90-$3.90 and selling it all near the all-time bubble high. Even investor relations lady (edit: widow of the founder) pulled millions.\n\nSeriously considering sending in my fucking resume. The puts I got while it was at $38 are printing, but goddamn. You could nearly outperform the market just holding this stock during sane times and selling for +1250% when a pandemic or scare pops it once every 10 years. \n\nIf anyone is still long this thing, get out while the getting's good.\n\n[Check out the form 4's for yourself here.](https://searchwww.sec.gov/EDGARFSClient/jsp/EDGAR_MainAccess.jsp?search_text=%22alpha%20pro%20tech%22&isAdv=false)\n\n**Edit: for those who haven't been following along, this stock was trading at $3.20 three months ago and has spiked with every major virus before crashing back down.**", "created_utc": 1583413214.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fduwot/for_anyone_following_apt_management_already/", "is_self": true}
