{"id": "gs7mjl", "title": "PRPL: More DD For You Autists", "selftext": "[Purple](https://purple.com/).  It's for investors who use mattresses for more than sleeping.\n\n**For those of you who have trouble making it through complete sentences**:  buy 15c (June, July, Oct or Jan strikes).\n\n**For those of you who prefer some level of Due Diligence before a play**, I'd recommend some catch up reading before you tackle the below:\n\n* [PRPL KILLED earnings! Tendies can still be made. Here's how.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WSBElite/comments/gi2m0m/prpl_killed_earnings_tendies_can_still_be_made/)\n* [PRPL to $19+ by 8/12 (ER). Calling it again!](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gqpqa3/prpl_to_19_by_812_er_calling_it_again/)\n\nIf you really want to dig in, feel free to read through my post history on PRPL over two years.  I'll be compiling these into my memoirs soon:  \"How I made my first, second and third million.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe post below builds upon the previous DD.   Today, we are going to chat about:\n\n* Short Interest in a Coliseum Capital World\n* Number of Job Openings\n* Insights from a Mattress Firm Manager\n* Verifying Sales Volume\n* Capacity Expansion\n* PRPL Options Have a Market Maker Now\n\nI'm going to assume you read the previous DD and simply build on the previous without providing context.  If you can be too lazy to go back and read, I can be too lazy to write it again.\n\n# Short Interest in a Coliseum Capital World\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/79vlkumtqi151.png?width=477&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7c4a03d15f88fa0cc10653f95afaa68e3007508\n\nShort interest data on the stock was [released last night by NASDAQ](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/prpl/short-interest).   We saw short interest increase 24.5% over the previously reported period!!   This number was after earnings too at the beginning of the recovery from the secondary offering drop.\n\nAs we learned on my previous posts, Coliseum Capital ate up most of the secondary (they are on the board and are a buy and hold long-term player), which means the short interest as a % of non-institutional float just went up!\n\nThis is a GREAT thing!   As PRPL does its run up starting in a week or so, we will likely see an even bigger squeeze than we expected before.\n\n# Number of Job Openings\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9yyf3hnuqi151.png?width=145&format=png&auto=webp&s=785b39be72132c9a5280cef5a52eed8bf23ee3aa\n\nAs predicted and as explained on the earnings call, PRPL is in hiring mode again.   It is only accelerating.\n\n# Insights from a Mattress Firm Manager\n\nOn another forum I participate on that has a thread focused on this stock, there is a Manager at Mattress Firm (with 15 years of experience in the mattress industry) on the forum that regularly posts.  I don't know if he is corporate or at the store level, but he often posts great insights on Purple.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4ihuzctvqi151.png?width=579&format=png&auto=webp&s=613f5d911b0f145c9d767a0323c8820dac4e3f8b\n\nA few things to note from his post:\n\n1. Memorial Day was recording breaking for mattresses:  Purple was a stand out.\n2. Production at Purple for the cheaper original mattress has been halted to support demand for the higher end Hybrid \"2, 3, and 4s\", which are also much higher revenue and margin for Purple.\n3. Mattress Firm and likely Purple are sold out of inventory if delivery pipelines are at least 4 weeks long.\n4. Most importantly, OP lets us know that Karen won't get her mattress faster by talking to the manager.\n\n# Verifying Sales Volume\n\nTo verify the sales volume assertions from the Mattress Firm guy, I went on to [Purple.com](https://Purple.com) and attempted to go through the ordering process for a King bed.   Purple had a conversion-killing popover like the below (if they are willing to kill conversion with this, you know they aren't hurting for sales and they've probably pulled back on marketing spend to a more efficient level).\n\n**Original Mattress (Cheapest)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vdbjitvwqi151.png?width=1526&format=png&auto=webp&s=275d521ded5bd4e9d8cea940f9465484ef1c2a23\n\n**Hybrid 2\"**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6q505gsxqi151.png?width=1409&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d5113606e8faa586b6d4ef5992f7a76fd15637a\n\n**Hybrid Premier 3\"**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2n5nypzyqi151.png?width=1618&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2e28eaf7d1882c19a6fece66ce5128f2faad2c5\n\n**Hybrid Premier 4\"**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5mu71exzqi151.png?width=1551&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e00621d981f17baa51bc566fc3755ba213b26e5\n\nI'm sure a few of you are glad I've posted pictures so it makes it easier to follow.   Too bad there are words on the pictures as well...\n\nAs an investor, I'm liking the fact that we sold out of our $75M in revenue value of inventory stock that we had in place at the beginning of the quarter.   I'm also liking that Mattress Firm is four weeks delayed while the DTC site is less delayed:  it shows that management is making good on their promise to prioritize higher margin and revenue DTC sales over wholesale partners for now (in the long run, we obviously want to keep our wholesale partners happy too).\n\nIt is the end of May already.   This stockout pretty much guarantees a revenue maximized Q2 as the next two weeks into June have already been sold.   If sales continue at a reasonable pace, this momentum carries into Q3.   This stock should be worth much more right now.\n\n# Capacity Expansion\n\nWe learned from the earnings call that the 7th Mattress Max machine (the proprietary, built-in-house machines used to make their unique mattresses) will be online by the end of May.   This machine represents an additional 20% increase in capacity over 2019 EOY capacity.\n\nThrough another forum on this stock, we've learned that the manufacturing team now has mandatory Sunday workdays, which were previously voluntary, which is another capacity expansion.\n\nBack of the napkin, this brings us to 910 beds per day of average capacity.   At an estimated average selling price of $2,200 (take the [$1,863 Q1 2020 average selling price from the S-3](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1643953/000119312520140451/d922462ds3a.htm), adjust for the 40% discount the beds are sold to wholesale at, and adjust again for the reduction in wholesale and shift to DTC), this gives PRPL a max manufacturing capacity of $182M or so in revenue for a full 91-day quarter.   Realize that we only get one month of that, but we also had $42M in inventories (at an approximate $75M in DTC revenue value) at the beginning of the quarter.\n\n***Given that we know they are sold out of inventory, we should have a killer Q2 that may be closer to the top end of my previous estimates*** (especially if you include an estimated $15-$20M in revenue from ancillaries like seat cushions for all of your COVID stay at home butts that aren't subject to the same manufacturing constraints).  Hey, it might even beat that top end.   With lower marketing costs per DTC unit.   Awesome.\n\n# PRPL Options Have a Market Maker Now\n\nThe PRPL options chain went live last Thursday, but have been plagued with ridiculously awful bid/ask spreads and little volume, which has resulted in very little open interest.   I've probably had 2500 contracts worth of bids I've cycled through trying to get a reasonable price.\n\nBased upon the reasonable bid/ask spreads yesterday (for a stock of this volume--remember this isn't an S&P 500) today, it looks like we got a market maker to pick up PRPL for us.\n\nI was able to pick up 40 15c contracts at very reasonable prices for Jun and Oct.  There is still a decent sized Bid/Ask, but not out of line at all with a stock of this volume.\n\n# Frequent Comments and Questions\n\nI keep getting the same comments and questions on these threads and via PM, so I figure I would answer some here.\n\n**Why do you only post on PRPL?**\n\nWell, I'm over a million into this stock so it is important to me to keep a good eye on it.   As a result, I know more about this position than any other position I'm holding.  I'm trying to pay it forward to this community by spending the time to write decent DD in appreciation for all the money I have made off of others' DD here.   Please do the same with the stocks you know best.\n\n**This is a pump and dump.**\n\nThis is the antithesis of a pump and dump.  First of all, I've been posting on this for over two years.   Second of all, I've held almost all of my position that entire time (mostly added, but did a few sells in the last few weeks to play with PRPL options).   Third, you are an idiot and don't have any money to play this anyways.\n\n**What is a warrant?**\n\nWarrants are simply options written by the company itself rather than another investor via CBOE.   The warrants trade individually (instead of contracts of 100) under the ticker PRPLW.   They are not available on some brokers (e.g. Robinhood).   They have an expiration of 2/2023 and an exercise price of $11.50 (two warrants for one share).   They are like super LEAPs.\n\n# My Positions\n\nI own:\n\n* 1 share of PRPL\n* 30x 15c 6/19\n* 10x 15c 10/16\n* 521,400x PRPLW\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/alvcvt51ri151.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6271fed7550fa0aeab2abe6acc7bc066a727f1a\n\nThis isn't investment advice.
