Bern will trigger the crash the bears have been waiting for. What are y'all doing if anything to hedge against this risk? \n\nNoting rule 7, I care not for politics, fuck, Bernie may even be great for the people and great for the USA, but what I do care for is maintaining my current tendie pile and ideally growing it more. I think its fair to say however the bull market ends the moment trump leaves office and I want to have a plan both both ways. \n\nIf Bern risk will get priced in more and more every time he wins a primary so I don't want to leave it until he wins the nomination or the presidency to make my moves.", "created_utc": 1581484536, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f2m3gl/bernie/", "is_self": true}
