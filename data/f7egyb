Their top drug directly competes with [Neulasta, a drug used all the time in chemo patients](https://www.neulasta.com/learn-about-neulasta/). \n\nBiosimilars are like the brand name or generic drug, but a couple molecules different, which lets them bypass patents. Often times, these biosimilars are just as effective as the original formulation. For a quick example, Carfentanil is a biosimilar to fentanyl. \n\nTheir market adoption rate as of last ER is skyrocketing because their drug is so much cheaper than Neulasta. They're so successful that their CEO said on the last ER that they now have pharma inventors coming to them with new biosimilar formulations unsolicited.\n\nER is next week and I'm expecting them to absolutely crush it. \n\nTL;DR - Buy puts", "created_utc": 1582306244, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7egyb/chrs_earnings_dd/", "is_self": true}
