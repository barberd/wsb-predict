{"id": "haa7v9", "title": "\"Mortality rate is low\" is the stupidest most retarded thing I've ever heard.", "selftext": "People who say we don't need a second lockdown even if coronavirus gets out of hand because of mortality being low are retarded. Mortality is low BECAUSE we locked down. If we don't lock down hospitals will be overrun again. If the hospitals are overrun, the staff is stretched thing, along with the equipment. If all of that is happening, people are receiving sub standard care ( to no fault of the doctors and nurses ). So more people fucking die. The current mortality rate of corona is only lower than we expect because we closed down. If we don't close again if there is a second spike of hospitalizations. More than the now \"low mortality rate\" bullshit people will die. Not good for bulls you fucking morons so stop being mindless retarded bulls and saying corona no matter cuz low people no die die.", "created_utc": 1592333801.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/haa7v9/mortality_rate_is_low_is_the_stupidest_most/", "is_self": true}
