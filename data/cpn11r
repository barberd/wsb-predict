{"id": "cpn11r", "title": "Options vs mini futures and other derivatives", "selftext": "Downvote away this stupid question!\n\nOptions seem really popular here and I'm struggling to understand why? \n\nEg, the ASX is currently at 6,575. \n\nIf I wanted to make a bet that it will continue to go down, I could buy a mini short that becomes worthless if ASX reaches 6600, but offers leveraged returns the lower it goes. Since the leverage isn't reset daily, it could be kept indefinitely with relatively low slippage. At no point would I risk losing more than I put in (ie can't enter negative territory) or be forced to buy the underlying. \n\nThis all seems a lot simpler than options trading which does come with the risk of losing more than you put in, being forced to buy the underlying etc etc.\n\nSo why are options so seemingly popular? And what do y'all think about alternatives like mini futures and other derivates vs options?", "created_utc": 1565664879, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cpn11r/options_vs_mini_futures_and_other_derivatives/", "is_self": true}
