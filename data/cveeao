I use a very creative process for your enjoyment and organize in such a way that tries to give you the highest level of understanding possible, but if you read for a tldr...you are pleb. Now, would you kindly sit down, and take your time. If you dont have this* [level of dedication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2dehpRFyLA)*, leave now.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **A partnership gone betrayed between** [Gold](https://imgur.com/a/iJ6U4lv) **vs (Dollar)** [Bills](https://imgur.com/a/nSI1mlw)\n\n As the puzzle pieces come into the narrative for gold, I am seeing a story very similar to Kill Bill. Its beautiful, follow me.\n\nIn 1971, Nixon took us off the gold standard \"temporarily\", [but the plan was to always to burry Gold.](https://youtu.be/Ris0Kce0ZPo?t=148)\n\nI mean is this so hard to believe? Why doesn't the fact NIXON, a man who was crazy paranoid simply not tell you everything you need to know? The man was a certified CROOK.\n\nAn excerpt from [Nixon Shock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_shock): \"By 1973, the Bretton Woods system was replaced *de facto* by the current regime based on freely floating fiat currencies.\" (Sound familiar today?)\n\nCan we honestly say this was a wise man? Do you think he cared about the unintended consequences? I would say no because he fought a stupid war, did illegal operations with politics, and in the end abandoned his post as president. In my eyes, this man is no different than Bernie Madoff, ***A Wizard of*** [***Lies***](https://imgur.com/a/t4ZMGoZ)***.***\n\nMy friend, the US dollar died in 1971, and ever since then you have used the Nixon Dollar. His curse is still here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Gold: no matter what you do to constrain it, you will fail.**\n\nThere's a scene from Kill Bill, that perfectly visualizes the relentless nature of Gold Climbing back for [Revenge](https://youtu.be/Mk5fAvpwtKU?t=17). YOU CAN NOT STOP THIS. WE WILL CLAP THOSE CHEEKS. Gold has [Relentless Confidence](https://youtu.be/zCqN-xNjS-0?t=140), it's confidence level is literally God-Like.\n\n\"Well why is it taking so long?\" Gold does two things, it allows fiat to melt itself away, and chooses the right time to blitzkrieg fiat at the weakest. Gold doesn't care how many fiat goons you send in, [Its futile.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8trTO5mJYsg) \n\nGold has a [List of Fiat Currencies](https://youtu.be/VnoT6_LNUjA?t=8) that it has to go through, so it does take a little while. Look at the 10 year chart on this [Website.](https://www.kitco.com/gold_currency/index.html?currency=sek&amp;timePeriod=10y&amp;flag=gold&amp;otherChart=no) Fiats have been getting slaughtered. Fact.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen Gold reaches that last one, the Dollar Bill, It will be way more swift than people realize because other countries have already seen their currencies melt, and foreigners will actually understand first that the USD is on the same course because it has happened to them first! Foreigners are simply [Psychologically Primed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLeji6EidI8) already with this fear. That is why I think when the snap happens it will be a death blow like this, [ The Five Finger Death Punch.](https://youtu.be/VbDbOdKL9ZY?t=22)\n\n***You can put gold in a coma, burry it, send an army of fiat, but it will not change a god damn thing. She's gonna kill bill.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Bonus: This video demonstrates the level of intensity of both Trump and Xi, in regards to the trade war. They are literally the same. Unmovable Object VS Unstoppable Force. The only difference is Xi can actually chop someones head off.***  [\"Thank you for your attention to this matter\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLvz5E61UNs)", "created_utc": 1566767910, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cveeao/gold_and_the_dollar_kill_bill_vol_3/", "is_self": true}
