If you're tired of getting your stock picks from an animal whose brain is just a couple of [ganglia clustered together](https://www.theonion.com/scientists-announce-shrimp-just-as-dumb-as-they-thought-1819579699), than you should tune in to another long winded read of Sten Duncan's Morally Dubious stock picks. You might recall my previous posts telling you to invest in [a company that gives poor people rip off car loans](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g8od1g/cacc_subprime_autoloans_are_totally_gonna_go_tits/), [hoarding gold doubloons](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gcdjeo/dd_gld_stagflation_and_you/), and [killing poor innocent chickens](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfv49n/a_tale_of_two_tendieshow_i_learned_to_stop/)\n\n\n\n\nBut this week's pick takes the cake, plus we are going to continue learning about the 10K! Fun!\n\n\n\nNow, the US of A to is not getting un-corona'd any time soon, and after ~~blowing their stimulus on options~~ responsibly using the stimulus to pay bills,  lots of people are again desperate for cash. And who do they turn to when they need dinero? Why, sketchy pawn shops and payday loans of course!\n\n\n\n\nNow, there are quite a few players in the pawn industry, and I looked at a lot of them. There are two that really caught my eye. EZCorp, [EZPW-10K](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000876523/5510410a-dc96-42bc-b22c-5694afcd24e1.pdf) and First Cash Financial Services [FCFS-10K](https://ir.firstcash.com/static-files/633807ec-40f1-44ec-aec3-5f78e3b9ea4c)\n\nIf you look at pg 17 on EZPW and pg 8 of FCFS, you will see both companies have stores operate stores in the US, Canada, and Latin America. In fact, our boys EZPW are heavy in Guatemala, El Sal, and Honduras. Stores per million people are as follows:\n\n* US: 1 store for every 680,000\n\n* Mexico: 1 store per 350,000\n\n* Guatemala/El Sal/Honduras: 1 store for every 280,000\n\nEZPW has 80 freaking stores in Guatemala, by comparison, they have just 22 in Canada---a country with 22 times the GDP. \n\nFCFS has a similar breakdown:\n\n* US: 1 store per 320,000\n\n* MX: 1 store per 90,000\n\n* GT/ES/HD: 1 store per 630,000\n\n\nNow, my first thought was that somehow these pawn stores allowed immigrant workers to send remittances to their families back home, but the 10Ks don't report any revenues from remittances. EZPW pg 4 has a helpful color-coded graph for my shrimp brain which shows pawn shops make most of their money on pawn loan fees, and a 1/3 of their revenues on selling merchandise. EZPW's Latin American business makes up almost 1/3 of their total revenues (pg87). FCFS is about the same, but not as cleanly presented. \n\nNow, why would Latin Americans need pawn shops so badly, and how could countries with half the US' population and 1/20 of the GDP generate so much cash for these pawn shops???\n\nI asked a friend of mine from Mexico, and she told me a big part of the problem is that there is no reliable way to sell personal stuff in Latin America. Craigslist or Ebay just aren't secure or widely used, and so the only option to turn your stuff into cash is a pawn shop. But that still doesn't explain why these companies focused on the most dangerous Latin American nations.\n\nWhat would explain the need for pawn shops, however,  is if huge swaths of the country had to come up with significant sums of cash with little notice. Which, thanks to gangs like Mara and Calle18, is [exactly what happens, thanks to gang's expansive protection rackets](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-el-salvador-extortion-idUSKCN0Y71QW). See, if these pawn shops were just about helping out poor folks without access to banks, than they wouldn't just be concentrated in the most violent and poor countries, they would be more likely to operate in Belize, Nicaragua, and Panama, which are just as poor, but [not as dangerous](https://cdn.cfr.org/sites/default/files/styles/large_xl/public/image/2019/10/central-america-homicides-2018%20%281%29_0.png) . So basically, Mara comes to an El Salvadorean's home or business, demands 'la renta', or extortion payments, and they pawn their jewelry or cellphone for quick cash, and then pay the gang. Until the next time.\n\nMy theory, is that by having their business driven by organized crime, these pawn stores are positioned to better weather the storm of COVID, since 1) the gangs will get more aggressive as the economy slows, and 2) the US closing it borders to asylum cases means that a major escape route from this extortion is closed . Once the US economy is more stable FCFS or EZPW will be well positioned to ~~exploit~~ serve the large number of Americans desperate for cash to pay back bills they accrued during the pandemic. \n\nSo, looking over the balance sheets, neither company is a terrible play, EZPW is trading at around 9x earnings, and it just met analysts expectations for this quarter. EZPW has quite a bit of debt though.  FCFS is better positioned, with less debt/goodwill, but it is trading at around 70x earnings. \n\nWhich ethically dubious company you like is up to you. Buy calls, but make sure they are out long enough that people will not only take out loans, but will pay them back, usually over 30, 60, or 90 days. \n\nAnd for the record, fuck these assholes. These companies absolutely trade in blood. But we can't change the world, just profit from it\n\nEDIT: TL/DR Calls on EZPW or FCFS min 30 days out.", "created_utc": 1589569724.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gkfdi6/hahaha_we_cant_ethically_invest_in_guatemalan/", "is_self": true}
