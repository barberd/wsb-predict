{"id": "b4hqe9", "title": "American Interstate Geoeconomics 2019", "selftext": "Hello\n\nThis is a report on the geoeconomics between and among US states, it\u2019s data and opinion that may or may not help your investing decisions. It\u2019s free and non scientific, so yeah here we go\n\nCalifornia: BUY. +Capital inflows. 15% of America\u2019s total GDP, California is the powerhouse churning progress, innovation, ideas, and culture for the rest of the country. California continues to be a solid investment, churning capital at a solid growth rate. The Electoral College is proportioned based on a state\u2019s population, and even with high cost of living, California has astoundedly maintained a solid 55 Electoral College representative votes, since 54 in 2000. This means that the diaspora of Californians leaving to live in other states for cheaper costs is more than offset by transplants, immigrants, and the natural birth rate. Incredible. California is a solid BUY and HOLD as they continue to attract capital, investment, and talent, and based on my data show zero chance of stopping any time soon.\n\nWashington, Oregon, Nevada, Colorado, Idaho: BUY. +Capital inflows. States west of the Mississippi which are being impacted the most impressively by California transplants and the capital they bring with them. Fastest growing small states seeing a surge in investment and money flows entering their states.\n\nMontana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, New Mexico, Mississippi, Alabama, South Carolina, Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia: SELL. -Capital outflows. Unfortunately I cannot say anything hopeful about any of these states, no one wants to go there let alone invest capital. Money flows are low in these states, and unless public policy is changed to attract investment, may even trend lower if that\u2019s possible.\n\nUtah: SELL. -Capital outflows. Mormon religion choking any and all economic progress made by the people in that state. May be nice to vacation, that\u2019s all I can say.\n\nArizona: BUY. +Capital inflows. California\u2019s playground. Capital from California flowing there as well as talent relocating for the universities and a solid housing boom, however gun and cowboy culture, along with a mellow public policy lead Arizona to be a nice state, but not a state I see enough capital flows entering in to make it the next big thing.\n\nTexas: BUY. +Capital inflows. Huge capital attraction, huge investment, huge growth, one of the top destinations for California, big tech, and anyone and everyone who can\u2019t make it in California. Texas however does not have the cohesiveness of California, and the people it attracts are upset and frustrated Californians, which is good for the money but not necessarily good for the culture. Texas is a strong and solid investment whose economy is so large it can absorb transplants and capital inflows, however since it\u2019s so large it\u2019s going to take an even longer time before these talent and capital inflows make a big difference on the overall state economy.\n\nMinnesota: BUY. +Capital inflows. Socialist bastion, tons of education, public programs, and real solid capital attraction. Nothing special though, and I think Minnesota will produce some great people, education, knowledge, and arts, however I do not see Minnesota becoming some sort of large capital attraction inflow any time soon. If any state were to produce the Great American Novel, it\u2019d be an author in Minnesota.\n\nIowa: SELL. -Capital outflows. Swing state since it has the first primary, this brilliant first mover advantage has led Iowa to become a swing state in the general election and lead politicians to invest time, money, and energy into the state. This singlehandedly helps Iowa and Iowa\u2019s local economy differentiate itself from its Midwestern peers. Other than that I don\u2019t see much capital inflows into the state.\n\nHawaii: BUY. +Capital inflows. The capitol of the Pacific, Hawaii will always be a capital attraction for Asian businessmen and vacationers.\n\nIllinois: SELL. -Capital outflows. Corrupt Democratic Party choking the state of progress as public pensions paid before anything else and corrupt elections are the cultural norm. More than offbalances that capital attraction with futures and options trading in Chicago\u2019s stock markets.\n\nWisconsin: SELL. -Capital outflows. Another seemingly corrupt political state, but with less capital and talent inflows. May or may not turn around. Cultural and capital influence by Minnesota and Illinois. \n\nMichigan: SELL. -Capital outflows. Capital and talent outflows. Big 3 car companies not doing so well, rampant racism with black people in downtown Detroit.\n\nTennessee, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida: BUY. +Capital inflows. Huge inflows of tech, capital, and investment. \n\nOhio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey: BUY. +Capital inflows. Solid, middle class states, projected healthy growth over time.\n\nVirginia, DC, Maryland, Delaware: BUY. +Capital inflows. Federal Government capital inflows will keep these states going for as long as there is a Federal Government. \n\nNew England (Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut): BUY. +Capital inflows. Boston will always be a solid investment, as it is tied with New York City for venture capital, has a Colonial Enlightenment culture of tons of academia, education, and higher education, and a solidly moderate liberal policy. Connecticut is overtaxed, Rhode Island is just small and corrupt, Vermont may see a few transplants but otherwise too small, New Hampshire will continue to be libertarian on economic policies and progressive on social policies, and Maine will have hunters, college students, vacationers, and immigrants. \n\nNew York: BUY NYC, SELL NY STATE. +Capital inflows NYC, -Capital outflows NY state. If it weren\u2019t for New York City, New York State would be one of the most depressed states in the country. NYC picks up the slack, and if anything NY state is holding NYC back in its absolute full potential to attract capital, investment, and talent.
