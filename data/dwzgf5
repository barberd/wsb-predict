Maybe you might do it in connection with an option bet or to strike fear on weak traders.\n\nI have seen long wick candles that get corrected but I always thought it would be too costly to get the volume to create it myself so wondering about known experiences doing this.\n\nIf you noticed in the previous 2 days, there was back-to-back sell offs at 2 PM on SPY in a single 1min candle for -$1 or -0.33% drop.  If you were there to BTFD, both got bought back up within minutes after.  Interesting what that caused cause it made it cheap to buy the calls (sell the puts) before the dip was bought up.", "created_utc": 1573863661, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dwzgf5/has_anyone_tried_to_create_an_ath_or_atl_candle/", "is_self": true}
