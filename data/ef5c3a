{"id": "ef5c3a", "title": "Tesla DD for those who believe", "selftext": "So I came back home for Christmas and per usual, my mother completely decorated the house for Christmas. Now I'm sure most of you have seen those stocking hangers that say NOEL and/or JOY.\n\nWell... I think Santa came early this year as I noticed something strange. It wasn't Noel on the fire place. It was ELON. This surely is a sign that Tesla has unrealized tendies and is a must buy this Christmas season. Invest only if you believe though!!! You have been warned!\n\nAlso, on the other side of the fireplace, it says YOJ. I've still yet to figure that one out.", "created_utc": 1577213163, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ef5c3a/tesla_dd_for_those_who_believe/", "is_self": true}
