Since then they have increased about 15% and options value have gained approximately 150-400% returns.\n\nThe good thing is this is still an absolute great buying point. They just released amazing data on their hypertriglyceridemia (APOC3) drug. It increased HDL-C (good cholesterol) by mean of 62% in the highest single dose.

The company is a goldmine and will be getting drugs approved in coming years. \n\nPlay long-term monthly options for best returns. For now, buy January to March calls and if you don\u2019t mind leaving your money parked for a while I\u2019d recommend 2022 calls.\n\nToday Arwr is up big because a competitor co, MDCO, who has a deal with ALNY for a cardio vascular drug may get bought out by Novartis.\n\n[gains](https://imgur.com/a/lYlTVed)", "created_utc": 1574185482, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dynsht/arwr_to_the_moon/", "is_self": true}
