DD inside.", "selftext": "Commencing on April 21, 2020, because of extraordinary market conditions in the crude oil markets, including super contango, USO has invested in other permitted investments, as described below and in its prospectus. In particular, on April 21, 2020, USO invested in approximately 40% of its portfolio in crude oil futures contracts on the NYMEX and ICE Futures in the June contract, approximately 55% of its portfolio in crude oil futures contracts on the NYMEX and ICE Futures in the July contract and approximately 5% of its portfolio in crude oil futures contracts on the NYMEX and ICE Futures in the August contract, except when the front month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case the futures contracts held by USO will be rolled into the July contract, August contract and September contract. In addition, commencing on April 22, 2020, USO in response to ongoing extraordinary market conditions in the crude oil markets, including super contango, may invest in the above described crude oil futures contracts on the NYMEX and ICE Futures in any month available or in varying percentages or invest in any other of the permitted investments described below and in its prospectus, without further disclosure. USO intends to attempt to continue tracking USO\u2019s benchmark as closely as possible, however significant tracking deviations may occur above and beyond the differences described herein. USO\u2019s portfolio holdings as of the end of the prior business day are posted each day on the website: www.uscfinvestments.com/uso. As stated in the prospectus for USO, USO seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in futures contracts for light, sweet crude oil, other types of crude oil, diesel-heating oil, gasoline, natural gas, and other petroleum-based fuels that are traded on the NYMEX, ICE Futures Europe and ICE Futures U.S. (together, \u201cICE Futures\u201d) or other U.S. and foreign exchanges (collectively, \u201cOil Futures Contracts\u201d) and to a lesser extent, in order to comply with regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions, other oil-related investments such as cash-settled options on Oil Futures Contracts, forward contracts for oil, cleared swap contracts and non-exchange traded (\u201cover-the-counter\u201d or \u201cOTC\u201d) transactions that are based on the price of oil, other petroleum-based fuels, Oil Futures Contracts and indices based on the foregoing (collectively, \u201cOther Oil Related Investments\u201d). Market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause USO to invest in Other Oil-Related Investments include those allowing USO to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing. (For convenience and unless otherwise specified, Oil Futures Contracts and Other Oil-Related Investments collectively are referred to as \u201cOil Interests\u201d in the prospectus.) The foregoing may impact the performance of USO. In addition, as a result of these changes, USO may not be able to track the Benchmark Futures Contract or meet its investment objective, which is for the daily percentage changes in the NAV per share to reflect the daily percentage changes of the spot price of light, sweet crude oil, as measured by the daily percentage changes in the price of Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, plus interest earned on USO\u2019s collateral holdings, less USO\u2019s expenses.\n\nShort version of this:\n\nMarket was exploiting USO. USO changed their prospectus.\n\nCurrent holdings:\n\n40% of its portfolio in crude oil futures contracts on the NYMEX and ICE Futures in the June contract, approximately 55% of its portfolio in crude oil futures contracts on the NYMEX and ICE Futures in the July contract, 5% in aug is the current holdings.\n\nExpect those June and July contracts to continue to be rolled by USO. Expect their NAV to continue to be hit. Expect that they may take money and buy things like swaps and other instuments.\n\nIn the future after this, USO will not be nearly as good of a short, but their NAV should be chopped down over the next few days from contango. Short calls and long puts should print for the next few days, but I recommend closing any long puts you have in the next few days, and watching short calls carefully.\n\nIV should drop on USO, so your short calls should do even better, but long puts will get squished.\n\nLook to exit your puts in the next few days, monitor your short calls. USO is going to have to move A LOT, value wise, in the next month or two to overcome how fucked it has got, so your short calls should still be OK. You have a giant ass buffer on them with the sky high IV.\n\nIf you trade futures, shorting Jun and Jul may be good, USO is selling, that should pressure it downward. If you are smart, you can front run USO tonight and short CL Jun and Jul at futures open.\n\nIf you want to make money and don't mind living dangerously, short calls on USO.  IV is BONKERS, so you get paid super well, and contango is going to fuck this thing harder than I can fuck your mom.  All the rolling will crush NAV over the next few days, and contango will do the rest.\n\nJul 17 20 SHORT 3c for .90 credit, or\nJun 19 20 SHORT 4c for .40 credit.\n\n\nhttp://www.uscfinvestments.com/holdings/uso\nNote: you can monitor their holdings here.  It is for yesterday, but if you check each day, you can see what they are holding.", "created_utc": 1587506246.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5onin/uso_changing_fund_structure_to_invest_in_any_oil/", "is_self": true}
