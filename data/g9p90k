HPE pretty much supplies all the laptops for major companies because DELL is pretty shitty and a lot of people that had desktops in the office, now are using Laptops since they are working from home. Sales of laptops have increased 10% in retail, 15% in business. OI is about 1.2k on HPE, and you have 6 months of time for it to move 3 dollars, which is not even its ATH. Going to pick up more if their earnings move it down.   \n\n\nHPE 11/20 13 calls", "created_utc": 1588087670.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9p90k/hpe_strategy/", "is_self": true}
