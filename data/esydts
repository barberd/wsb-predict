Whatsapp used by MBS to hack Bezos.", "selftext": "These whatsapp message are hillarious:\n\nNearly four weeks later, on May 1, Bezos received a WhatsApp message from the crown prince\u2019s account, which arrived \u201cunexpectedly and without explanation, meaning it was not discussed by the parties in advance of being sent,\u201d according to a November 2019 report by FTI Consulting Inc., a business advisory firm, which was published by Vice.  The message included a 4.22 MB video. Within hours of receiving it, \u201ca massive and unauthorized exfiltration of data from Bezos\u2019s phone began,\u201d according to the report. \n\nOn Nov. 8, 2018, Bezos received another message from the crown prince\u2019s WhatsApp account, when Bezos and his wife were exploring a divorce and before his marital problems became public, according to the FTI Consulting report. It showed a picture of a woman who resembled Lauren Sanchez, with whom Bezos was having a then-secret relationship, and read: \u201cArguing with a woman is like reading the Software License Agreement. In the end you have to ignore everything and click I agree,\u201d according to the report.\n\nThe crown prince hasn\u2019t yet addressed the allegations. But on Feb. 16, 2019, two days after Bezos had received a briefing on the Saudi online campaign against him, his WhatsApp account sent another message to Bezos telling him to be skeptical of what he was hearing. \u201cJeff all what you hear or told to it\u2019s not true and it\u2019s matter of time tell you know the truth,\u201d the message says, according to the FTI Consulting report. \u201cThere is nothing against you or Amazon from me or Saudi Arabia.\u201d", "created_utc": 1579809259, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/esydts/short_fb_whatsapp_used_by_mbs_to_hack_bezos/", "is_self": true}
