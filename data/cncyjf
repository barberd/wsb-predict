{"id": "cncyjf", "title": "Why TEVA Going Up Lately", "selftext": "/u/midwstchnk asked me on one of my[previous posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cn63ha/teva_did_not_go_to_the_moon/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) \u201cwhy Teva going up lately\u201d. As I started to explain it got too long so I figured I\u2019d make a new post. \n\n1) It hit a historic low this morning during a second day of panic selling, hadn\u2019t been that low since 1999. Think about that and look at the chart. I wouldn\u2019t be shocked if Berkshire gobbled up a ton from weak hands, didn\u2019t Buffett just say they have warehouses of tendies waiting for stocks to be cheap enough? Well Teva peaked 4 years ago today at $70ish dollars. 3 years ago today, Teva was down ~23% (8/7/2015-8/7/2016). Teva then proceeds to drop 68% from Aug 2016 - Aug 2017, then drops another 34% in a few months. The overall drop of 83% from 2015-2017 was in the wake of the price fixing scandal, which occurred from 2013-2015. Meanwhile the opioid dilemma is also occurring (lawsuit states 2006-2012). Two scandals occurring under the same management? Well in comes K\u00e5re Schultz in Sept 2017 as CEO, over the course of the next year Teva rose by 113% , those are some big gains. Now the opioid stuff brought the pps down 36% from the previous low in 2017. This week alone Teva was down 20% to a 52 week low of 6.34, a 1999 historical low resistance level. Teva dropped 10% the day before earnings, dropped 10% again at open after reporting 0.60 eps and beating estimates while also reiterating full year guidance. Teva reversed drastically from the lows the of 6.34 this morning to up almost $1 to 7.30 (14%). This is a reversal signal and bull train is coming. Management has already set aside ~650 million for what they said was the worst case situation. It\u2019s all baked in. Now my next point is key.\n\n2) Although sales are slowing, its drug copaxone still brought in $260 million, ajovy is being launched in the EU and also brought in 23 million, the Epipen Jr. is being launched in the coming weeks and will be taking market share from MYLs undersupply. Plus austedo sales is up 30% from last quarter with 24,000 prescriptions being wrote in 2Q. Overall Austedo brought in 93 million for the second quarter. I can personally vouch for the success of Austedo, I\u2019ve been on it for 3 months now and it\u2019s amazing. Since most of you probably aren\u2019t aware, Austedo is Teva\u2019s drug which not only not only treats, but in some cases cures patients suffering from debilitating forms of autism. Austedo cured my autism, which is why I bought the fuck out of Teva stock at 6.38 and 1/15/21 $8 Calls at $1.60 (currently $2.35). Teva will be a winner over this next year; pop your Austedo, Buy into the company with a cure, then kick back and watch the tendies flow. \n\nSo to answer your question why Teva going up lately midwstchnk , it\u2019s because I\u2019m not autistic. \n\nFuck you guys I\u2019m right.", "created_utc": 1565218223, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cncyjf/why_teva_going_up_lately/", "is_self": true}
