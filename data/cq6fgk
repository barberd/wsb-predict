How did it go from the highest retard-per-capita sub to suddenly getting shit right a few days in a row, and having almost all new posts talk about it? First we have that guy from Argentina who predicted a 48% one-day crash due to an election result that was definitely not priced in, then nose guy brings us some solid DD on weird biotech type shit that doesn't even have options (some of y'all even decided to venture into stocks for that, so kudos to you for trying something new) and now big man here is raining down a golden shower on this sub because he got his trade exactly right. Is this like the $DIS of this quarter, or did these three suddenly boost the IQ of the entire sub?", "created_utc": 1565768450, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cq6fgk/what_happened_to_this_sub/", "is_self": true}
