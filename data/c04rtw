I'm going to take the other side and say it goes on into 2020 as China does bend the knee, viewing this administration as toxic.\n\nNow, we're in 2020 and the Fed has no ammo for when this economic cycle ends. And this will usher in a 2007 style collapse as the global economy naturally contracts and exposes the excessed of the last decade.\n\nEven with QE, the US will not get back to normal because now it has been Japanified with the Fed's huge balance sheet, US debt, and no more confidence in the growth stocks (as many have imploded)\n\nOne way out is to do what Japan has done and buy equities. But that hasn't worked for them. No academic has persuasively argued a way out of the end of the debt cycle.  \n\nRay Dahlio and I smoke a cigar.", "created_utc": 1560426179, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c04rtw/prediction_50_tariffs_by_november_2019/", "is_self": true}
