I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 9th, 2019.\n\n# **What Trump does before trade deadline is the \u2018wild card\u2019 that will drive markets in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/06/what-trump-does-before-trade-deadline-is-the-wild-card-that-will-drive-markets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The Trump administration\u2019s Dec. 15 deadline for new tariffs on China looms large, and while most strategists expect them to be delayed while talks continue, they don\u2019t rule out the unexpected.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest thing in the room next week. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to raise them. I think they\u2019ll find a reason,\u201d said James Pauslen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. But Paulsen said President Donald Trump\u2019s unpredictable nature makes it really impossible to tell what will happen as the deadline nears.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cHe\u2019s the one off you\u2019re never sure about. It\u2019s not just tariffs. It could be damn near anything,\u201d Paulsen said. \u201cI think he goes out of his way to be a wild card.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Just in the past week, Trump said he would put new tariffs on Brazil, Argentina and France. He rattled markets when he said he could wait until after the election for a trade deal with China.\n*****\n&gt; Once dubbing himself \u201ctariff man,\u201d Trump reminded markets that he sees tariffs as a way of getting what he wants from an opponent, and traders were reminded tariffs may be around for a long time.\n*****\n&gt; Trade certainly could be the most important event for markets in the week ahead, which also includes a Fed interest rate decision Wednesday and the U.K.\u2019s election that could set the course for Brexit. If there\u2019s no China deal, that could beat up stocks, send Treasury yields lower and send investors into other safe havens.\n*****\n&gt; When Fed officials meet this week, they are not expected to change interest rates, but they are likely to discuss whether they believe their repo operations to drive liquidity in the short-term funding market are running smoothly, ahead of year end. Economic reports in the coming week include CPI inflation Wednesday, which could be an important input for the Fed.\n*****\n&gt; Punt, but no deal\n&gt; As of Friday, the White House did not appear any closer to striking a deal with China, though officials say talks are going fine. Back in August, Trump said if there is no deal, Dec. 15 is the date for a new wave of tariffs on $156 billion in Chinese goods, including cell phones, toys and lap top computers.\n*****\n&gt; Dan Clifton, head of policy research at Strategas, said it seems like a low probability there will be a deal in the coming week. \u201cWhat the market is focused on right now is whether there\u2019s going to be tariffs that to into effect on Dec. 15, or not. It\u2019s being rated pretty binary,\u201d said Clifton. \u201cI think what\u2019s happening here and the actions by China overnight looks like we\u2019re setting up for a kick.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; China removed some tariffs from U.S. agricultural products Friday, and administration officials have been talking about discussions going fine.\n*****\n&gt; Clifton said if tariffs are put on hold, it\u2019s unclear for how long. \u201cThose are going to be larger questions that have to be answered. This is really now about politics. Is it a better idea for the president to cut a deal without major structural reforms, or should he walk away? That\u2019s the larger debate that has to happen after Dec. 15,\u201d Clifton said. \u201cI\u2019m getting worried that some in the administration... they\u2019re leaning toward no deal category.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Clifton said Trump\u2019s approval rating falls when the trade wars heat up, so that may motivate him to complete the deal with China even if he doesn\u2019t get everything he wants.\n*****\n&gt; Michael Schumacher, director of rates strategy at Wells Fargo, said his base case is for a trade deal to be signed in the next couple of months, but even so, he said he can\u2019t entirely rule out another outcome. It would make sense for tariffs to be put on hold while talks continue.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe tweeter-in-chief controls that one, \u201d said Schumacher. \u201cThat\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess...I wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised if he suspends it for a few weeks. If he doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s a pretty unpleasant result. That\u2019s risk off. That\u2019s pretty clear.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Because the next group of tariffs would be on consumer goods, economists fear they could hit the economy through the consumer, the strongest and largest engine behind economic growth.\n*****\n&gt; Fed ahead\n&gt; The Fed has moved to the sidelines and says it is monitoring economic data before deciding its next move. Friday\u2019s strong November jobs report, with 266,000 jobs added, reinforces the Fed\u2019s decision to move to neutral for now.\n*****\n&gt; So the most important headlines from its meeting this week could be about the repo market, basically the plumbing for the financial system where financial institutions fund themselves. Interest rates in that somewhat obscure market spiked in September. Market pros said the issue was a cash crunch in the short term lending market, made better when the Fed started repo operations.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed now has multiple operations running over year end, and Schumacher said it has latitude to do more. Strategists expect there to be more pressure on the repo market as banks rein in operations to spruce up their balance sheets at year end.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cNo one is going to come to the Fed and say you did too much in the year-end funding,\u201d said Schumacher. \u201cIf repo happens to spike somewhat on one day, the Fed is going to hammer it the next day.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen said the markets will be attuned to this week\u2019s inflation numbers. Consumer inflation, the CPI is reported on Wednesday and producer prices are Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; A pickup in inflation of any significance is one thing that could pull the Fed from the sidelines, and prod it to consider a rate hike.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the inflation reports might start to get a little attention. Given the jobs numbers, the employment rate, growth picking up a little bit and a better tone in manufacturing. I do think if you get some hot CPI number, I don\u2019t know if the Fed can ignore it,\u201d he said. \u201cCore CPI is 2.3%.\u201d He said it would get noticed if it jumped to 2.5% or better.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\u2019s inflation target is 2% but its preferred measure is the PCE inflation, and that remains under 2%.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were sharply higher Friday but ended the past week flattish. The S&amp;P 500 was slightly higher, up 0.2% at 3,145, and the Dow was down 0.1% at 28,015. The Nasdaq was 0.1% lower, ending the week at 8,656.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/mpRRd4R.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/6Oy9x2v.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/OTowyXT.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/rNqm8ec.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/G3jnuuA.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/94K3Jyn.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lGvKvIl.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Sno3gqU.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DinyL6F.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OfqDUF1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/UtVFDbX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/aZs2m6H.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Reasons We Still Believe In December\n\n&gt; It has been a rough start to the most wonderful month of them all, with the S&amp;P 500 Index down each of the first two days of December. Don\u2019t stop believing just yet, though.\n\n&gt; Everyone knows December has usually been a good month for stocks, but what happened last year is still fresh in the minds of many investors. The S&amp;P 500 fell 9.1% in December 2018 for the worst December since 1931. That sounds really bad, until you realize stocks fell 30% in September 1931, but we digress.\n\n&gt; One major difference between now and last year is how well the global equities have been performing. Heading into December 2018, the S&amp;P 500 was up 3.2% year to date, but markets outside of the United States were already firmly in the red, with many down double digits.\n\n&gt; \u201cWe don\u2019t think stocks are on the verge of another massive December sell off,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIf my Cincinnati Bengals can win a game, anything is possible. However, we are quite encouraged by the overall participation we are seeing from various global stock markets this year versus last year, when the United States was about the only market in the green heading into December.\u201d\n\n&gt; Stocks have also overcome volatile starts to December recently. The S&amp;P 500 was down four days in a row to start 2013 and 2017, but the gauge still managed to gain 2.4% and 1%, respectively, in those years.\n\n&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, December has been the second-best month of the year for stocks going back to 1950. It is worth noting that it was the best month of the year before last year\u2019s massive drop. Stocks have historically been strong in pre-election years as well, and December has never been lower two times in a row during a pre-election year. Given stocks fell in December 2015, bulls could be smiling when this month is wrapped up.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/december-is-usually-strong_1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Could Impeachment Be Good for Investors?\n\n&gt; Impeaching a President with the possibility of removal from office is by no means great for the country. However, it may not be so horrible for the stock market or investors if history is any guide. We first touched on this over two years ago here on the blog and now that much has transpired and the US House of Representatives is now proceeding with drafting articles of impeachment we figured it was a good time to revisit the history (albeit limited) of market behavior during presidential impeachment proceedings. The three charts below really tell the story.\n\n&gt; During the Watergate scandal of Nixon\u2019s second term the market suffered a major bear market from January 1973 to October/December 1974 with the Dow down 45.1%, S&amp;P 500 down 48.2% and NASDAQ down 59.9%. Sure there were other factors that contributed to the bear market such as the Oil Embargo, Arab-Israeli War, collapse of the Bretton Woods system, high inflation and Watergate. However, shortly after Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974 the market reached the secular bear market low on October 3 for S&amp;P and NASDAQ and December 6 for the Dow.\n\n&gt; Leading up to the Clinton investigations and through his subsequent impeachment and the acquittal by the Senate the market was on a tear as one of the biggest bull markets in history raged on. After the 1994 midterm elections when the Republicans took back control of both houses of Congress the market remained on a 45 degree upward trajectory except for a few blips and the shortest bear market on record that lasted 45 days and bottomed on August 31, 1998.\n\n&gt; Clinton was impeached in December 1998 and acquitted in February 1999 as the market continued higher throughout his second term. Sure there were other factors that contributed to the late-1990s bull-run such as the Dotcom Boom, the Information Revolution, millennial fervor and a booming global economy, but Clinton\u2019s personal scandal had little negative impact on markets.\n\n&gt; It remains to be seen of course what will happen with President Trump\u2019s impeachment proceeding and how the world and markets react, but the market continues to march on. If the limited history of impeachment proceedings of a US President in modern times (no offense to our 17th President Andrew Johnson) is any guide, the market has bounced back after the last two impeachment proceedings and was higher a year later. Perhaps it will be better to buy any impeachment dip rather than sell it.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3f6ba01faa85d977cf767d1651a942bc/17c3bba13b0440ea-40/s500x750/95586d56bbe998230de5e63d7c8350be7a378e64.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1c06b7aa069219212dcd901dd9dee707/17c3bba13b0440ea-90/s500x750/20d9d09af6842eaf4246e62b651300e5dfccdbe8.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/8c2a398fb8620564773ee5ccd12b3997/17c3bba13b0440ea-0d/s500x750/9c90a2c8bae8077438097bd4d903f265b3ddd202.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical December Trading: Modest Strength Early, Choppy Middle and Solid Gains Late\n\n&gt; Historically, the first trading day of December, today, has a slightly bearish bias with S&amp;P 500 advancing 34 times over the last 69 years (since 1950) with an average loss of 0.02%. Tomorrow, the second trading day of December however, has been stronger, up 52.2% of the time since 1950 with an average gain of 0.08% and the third day is better still, up 59.4% of the time.\n\n&gt; Over the more recent 21-year period, December has opened with strength and gains over its first seven trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year when last minute selling, most likely for tax reasons, briefly interrupts the market\u2019s rally.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e400f05c94e9f9ece957bdd0144afba1/e0e4151f140072a0-3d/s500x750/16a3eac5e521b0498201a93d8a019bba7d3d7ca3.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Odds Still Favor A Gain for Rest of December Despite Rough Start\n\n&gt; Just when it was beginning to look like trade was heading in a positive direction, the wind changed direction again. Yesterday it was steel and aluminum tariffs on Brazil and Argentina and today a deal with China may not happen as soon as previously anticipated. The result was the worst first two trading days of December since last year and the sixth worst start since 1950 for S&amp;P 500. DJIA and NASDAQ are eighth worst since 1950 and 1971, respectively.\n\n&gt; However, historically past weakness in early December (losses over the first two trading days combined) were still followed by average gains for the remainder of the month the majority of the time. DJIA has advanced 74.19% of the time following losses over the first two trading days with an average gain for the remainder of December of 1.39%. S&amp;P 500 was up 67.65% of the time with an average rest of month gain of 0.84%. NASDAQ is modestly softer advancing 61.11% of the time during the remainder of December with an average advance of 0.30%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dad766467ad01d0f88e8aaa2f15febdb/2ab921d1d51ca895-cf/s500x750/a05af434b4089dad7d64e6f664f9a8b8a3b85f19.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/30d7528097d81739178e597f85f4e36f/2ab921d1d51ca895-9a/s500x750/8e3cf83a84702d51b29c36b146c71024fd089d36.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ee29a1dfaf45fd54ba60f87823c25403/2ab921d1d51ca895-97/s500x750/b70d05489ac3f3fff4330625dcede5acd7c98ba4.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending December 6th, 2019** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QZY9ciTiug))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 12.8.19**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$LULU** \n&gt; * **$COST** \n&gt; * **$THO** \n&gt; * **$AZO** \n&gt; * **$ADBE** \n&gt; * **$AVGO** \n&gt; * **$CIEN** \n&gt; * **$MDB** \n&gt; * **$CHWY** \n&gt; * **$SFIX** \n&gt; * **$AEO** \n&gt; * **$GME** \n&gt; * **$OLLI** \n&gt; * **$TOL** \n&gt; * **$PLCE** \n&gt; * **$UNFI** \n&gt; * **$PLAY** \n&gt; * **$ORCL** \n&gt; * **$HDS** \n&gt; * **$CONN** \n&gt; * **$MTN** \n&gt; * **$JT** \n&gt; * **$LOVE** \n&gt; * **$CMD** \n&gt; * **$PLAB** \n&gt; * **$DBI** \n&gt; * **$ROAD** \n&gt; * **$VRA** \n&gt; * **$CDMO** \n&gt; * **$LQDT** \n&gt; * **$TLRD** \n&gt; * **$TWST** \n&gt; * **$PHR** \n&gt; * **$NDSN** \n&gt; * **$MESA** \n&gt; * **$VERU** \n&gt; * **$DLHC** \n&gt; * **$BLBD** \n&gt; * **$OXM** \n&gt; * **$NX** \n&gt; * **$GNSS** \n&gt; * **$PHX** \n&gt; * **$GTIM**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DinyL6F.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/1NRTKQG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/AL1ctcN.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.9.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/R6pev3W.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 12.9.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9QQqRSb.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 12.10.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/na9KKsC.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 12.10.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JuRKN4p.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.11.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ayMMxgZ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 12.11.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dGqkTFA.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.12.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/nvn3mon.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 12.12.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/4RS7Qej.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.13.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 12.13.19 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# lululemon athletica inc. $229.38\n&gt; **lululemon athletica inc.
