Looking at 6,900+ volume on the 12c 02/21 fire sale. I've seen similar setups when BBBY sells off hard after news, albeit not to this level. Any odd-ball gap-up over the weekend or early next week and these will skyrocket. No odd-ball gap-up? Yeah these will be so worthless you should be able to claim the loss twice. Anyone think the knife hit the floor, or still falling?", "created_utc": 1581713352, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3yjcp/bbby_huge_volume_on_12c_0221_high_risk_and/", "is_self": true}
