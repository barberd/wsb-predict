{"id": "gcgyg5", "title": "3 Unusual Options Activity from last week", "selftext": "I have gotten a few emails asking about my UOA screening and if I was watching anything else, so I thought this would be an easier way to answer those questions and maybe start a dialogue to help everyone improve and make some money. I know there is a new private subreddit for these sort of things, but I thought this could be helpful for those who are not a part of it. \n\nI am still new to screening stocks, but I think I have found some worthwhile filters (time will tell I guess). \n\nMy current filters look something like [this](https://imgur.com/a/kartGCI). I will tweak the min: values depending on how many results I am getting, I will also remove filters depending on the results. So it's all very fluid and I currently don't have a hard set of filters. I like the sizzle index, but you can get some very large numbers with a relative low volume of trades. It's something to keep in mind if you rely solely on the sizzle index. \n\nI have set up my Charts and Trade tab to be linked so I can quickly send a ticker to a color code i.e. \"Red\" where it will send it to my charts and Trade tab to quickly screen the ticker. \n\nFrom scanning last week I have 3 tickers that stood out after a preliminary screen and light DD. I am spending the weekend digging deeper. I posted one or two of these the last few days in other discussions as well.  I think CNX had a couple good comments from others with some possible explanations for the unusual activity. \n\n\n#CNX \nCNX Resources Corporation, also called CNX Resources, is an oil and gas company. The firm engages in the exploration, development, production, gathering, processing and acquisition of natural gas properties in the Appalachian Basin.\n\n\nThis is the one I am most interested in. Their earnings were terrible, but to be expected in an oil and gas company.\n\n- 32K open interest for 17Jul20 6P. As of Friday 1MAY there was about 17k volume. I will know on Monday if more positions were opened or closed. \n- 28k puts for OCT 5p. As of Friday there was an additional 2k in volume, again,  I will know more on Monday if open vs close. \n- I only found 10k calls for OCT to be the closest \"hedge\" if you could call it that, but on Friday there was about the same volume as OI. It could be someone closing their call position, or opening a larger position. I'll know more on monday. \n\nu/rredditscum pointed [this out](https://www.timesherald.com/news/state/cnx-resources-corporation-announces-closing-of-300-million-of-convertible-senior-notes-and-full-exercise/article_c54a2ea4-a9e0-5914-a8ec-aee4f7b4c3d1.html). With the comment \"Maybe preparing for bankruptcy?\". Which was a good find and very possible scenario. \n\n#WMGI \nWright Medical Group NV engages in the provision of medical device products. It operates through the following segments: U.S. Lower Extremities and Biologics; U.S. Upper Extremities; International Extremities and Biologics; and Corporate. The U.S. Lower Extremities and Biologics includes the sale of its lower extremities products, such as joint implants and bone fixation devices for the foot and ankle; and biologics products used to support treatment of damaged or diseased bone, tendons, and soft tissues or to stimulate bone growth. The U.S. Upper Extremities segment focuses on joint implants and bone fixation devices for the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand; and products used across several anatomic sites to mechanically repair tissue-to-tissue or tissue-to-bone injuries, and other ancillary products.\n\n- 21AUG2020 25P @ 10k orders\n- 21AUG20 30P 10K orders\n- All other OI / volume for all other months is <4k.\n\nI found this [article]( https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/20/04/g15882970/stryker-extends-cash-tender-offer-for-all-outstanding-shares-of-wright-medical). They could be rejecting possible buyout offer from Stryker?\n\n\n#DRE \nDuke Realty Corp. operates as a real estate development company, which specializes in the ownership, management and development of industrial and medical office properties. It offers property and asset management, leasing, construction and other tenant related services. \n\n- 19JUN 30P @ 2500 orders (Around $262,500.00.\n\nThis is the one I have done the least bit of research on. I will dive into it more this weekend. It sticks out to me for 2 reasons, first just the abnormality of the puts/call ratio and the sheer volume. Secondly, this equates to roughly 10% of their average trading volume. Maybe I am wrong in thinking that is unusual?\n\nAs of now I do not hold any positions, but will move into positions on CNX and WMGI over the next week. I will update if I do anything with DRE as well as what my positions are.", "created_utc": 1588464902.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gcgyg5/3_unusual_options_activity_from_last_week/", "is_self": true}
