{"id": "eekjxo", "title": "What happens to TSLA call upside if Elon takes the company private at $420?", "selftext": "I have some Tesla options that are way in the black - I've been pretty lucky.\n\nBut much of their valuation is based on them potentially going way over $420 within a year.   If Elon is serious and takes the company private does that mean I'd have to sell them at $420, and the higher market valuation is no longer possible?    If so then I'll lose some money.\n\nCan someone explain how this might play out?
