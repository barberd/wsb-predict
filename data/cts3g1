Who needs contracts with individual athletes when they\u2019ve signed the country\u2019s largest municipality. So look jerkies... now that you\u2019ve lost your life savings and inheritance from grandma on SPY and VIX put contracts, and your allowance ain\u2019t quite enough to buy a NYC GO which doesn\u2019t even fucking matter because your YOL0 tax bracket is less than 0 now anyway... Go buy yourself a NYFD Nike T-shirt and go long Nike. Oh, and go fuck your self.\n\n*My post from 8/20:\nCan\u2019t believe the other guy in Oregon missed this... I guess it used to be so God Damn easy to make money seeing every yuppie in SF in 2004 wearing white headphones... or seeing USPS mailmen opening blue mailboxes in 2008 with red NFLX envelopes overflowing out of them.\n\nSo here\u2019s the play you muppets. The University of Oregon (ranked 11th) plays Auburn (ranked 16th) Aug 31st. Win or lose (picking up what I\u2019m putting down? You can\u2019t lose) it\u2019s going to be a great indicator for the season. Like Joey Harrington in \u201801 (Oregon/Nike Poster in Times Square), and Marcus Mariota in \u201814 (the guy every father wants his daughter to date), Nike leverages its literal collegiate poster child... You know their business model, no pun intended speaking of child, they\u2019re buying low and selling high (you muppets still understand this concept I hope with all these put option YOLO posts).\n\nBack to my analysis, this year, the poster child is Justin Herbert, Eugene Oregon\u2019s own son, projected to go Round 1 in the 2020 NFL Draft, #1 pick if he wins. Look at the historical chart. Don\u2019t think Uncle Phil and Nike won\u2019t be dumping a shitload into advertising this season and even if the market tanks, they\u2019re paying former athletes like Colin Kaepernick to make you feel good about buying $150 shoes. So go long, or YOLO the calls, Just Do It and thank me when earnings are reported in Feb of 2020.", "created_utc": 1566446382, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cts3g1/follow_up_to_discussion_living_near_fortune_500/", "is_self": true}
