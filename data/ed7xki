I got a task asking me to price a stock option, which should be an European non-dividend option, and compare my price to its quote. I used to use TSLA data downloaded from Yahoo Finance, but later I found stock options are usually American style? Index options, such as S&amp;P 500, are usually European but it seems they calculate dividend payments? I spent much time to search for one option to qualify European non dividend. Could anyone save me by give a hint. Thanks!", "created_utc": 1576834137, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ed7xki/where_i_could_get_european_nondividend_option_data/", "is_self": true}
