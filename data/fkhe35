{"id": "fkhe35", "title": "Autists being Autists", "selftext": "My first autist post:\n\nI\u2019d like to start this out by saying the caption may be misleading. The stock I am referring to doesn\u2019t trade on Robinhood as its OTC, so maybe it isn\u2019t us autists blowing it up. I think it is though.\n\nToday, the stock with the ticker $ZOOM jumped 45%. As many companies and schools download the Zoom ($ZM) communications app, money has flowed into $ZOOM, because some true autists think that is the communications app. $ZM is up 3% today. Once again $ZOOM is up 45%. This is a black swan event. To be honest, I don\u2019t even know what a black swan event is, but I think this is one of them.\n\nTLDR: some autists invested in the wrong stock.\n\nPlay: short the autism out of $ZOOM(buy puts), long $ZM as this money is redirected and $ZM has a great quarter.\n\nIn my own eyes, I have attained true WSB glory already. I am both a bull and a bear at once. \n\nSadly, I can\u2019t post a position BECAUSE I ONLY USE ROBINHOOD LIKE A DIPSHIT and this $ZOOM stock is OTC. \n\nCheers,\nMe", "created_utc": 1584495573.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkhe35/autists_being_autists/", "is_self": true}
