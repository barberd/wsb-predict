It is headquartered in Boise, Idaho.\n\n**How the coronavirus plays in**\n\nInternet usage and online consumerism has skyrocketed during this stay at home virus, we see everyone's mama and baby mama using zoom/online conferencing for chatting with their grandparents to politicians giving 2020 guidance in their pajamas. Businesses are either paying to use these services or paying to upgrade their systems to handle the crazy surge of need. This is were Micron Technology steps in. They are producing memory drives for these big computers that uses crazy amounts of memory. Consoles are sold out every. Everybody and Everything needs to use these chips. Donald Trump also stated with the China tensions he wants to move these chip stocks back into the Americas so deals may be completed to motivate factories to be opened in America. If we all remembers Micron Technology had rumours about moving a factory to America already.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Earnings**\n\nEarnings are June 29th.

We have Wells Fargo place a price target of $65. With Morgan Stanley at $63. Price is at $51 now. We see a similar company in intel at an ATH, and although it is not a direct correlation we can see commonalities in similar positive performance. I see MU  catching up to intel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What I'm Doing**\n\nI'm going to be buying $57.5c 7/17. Looking at all the variables it is pointing towards a new ath and a premarket runup due to the surge of the need of chips. Chipmakers are making bank on coronavirus demands and with that I will be playing the preearnings runup.", "created_utc": 1592848701.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hdx87j/micron_technology_mu_june_29_pandemic_earning_play/", "is_self": true}
