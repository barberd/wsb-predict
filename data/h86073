Same exact day as the narrative of second wave started to appear, the market began to decline. It is no secret to anyone that both sides (bull/bear) of the narrative have important players pushing their stories. However, the \"apocalypse\" side is winning now in the mainstream US media.\n\nWell then, instead of just reading articles in various websites, let's look at numbers to get some clarity of what is going on and if there really is a clear second wave coming.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Percentage change of cases, deaths, tests (Reuters):**\n\n1-week change of new cases -0.5%\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gpitnntenn451.png?width=658&format=png&auto=webp&s=78afbac8881521a1f87ce5bdadccad5fbba7d074\n\n1-week change of new deaths -15.4%\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/njme4ttknn451.png?width=665&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff243b2d5b6dd2e7250f3cd773a4a81a694d695f\n\n1-week change of new tests +16.1%\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p5a96y3onn451.png?width=661&format=png&auto=webp&s=200ce9dbd445c4243243b9576dff9e49d6f6ce2d\n\nTesting increased, cases and deaths decreased. \n\nIf you look state by state, you will find states that are increasing in cases. Well, obviously, same as couple months ago Europe had some countries with decreasing numbers, while in US the virus was just arriving, so with the same logic you could say back then it was 2nd wave of COVID-19 starting, but that's just not true.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMore numbers:\n\n**Daily deaths in US**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ak30iuxgrn451.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=b861a98846373130e9355362335716b02c5a10bf\n\n**Daily cases in US**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eq1yky9urn451.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=afe4a8d3cb697bde9024daf124d50d3013996e31\n\n**Daily tests in US**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w12tkzq1un451.png?width=674&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b75999cc7d6ecf02177df580798489c723b6ec0\n\nCases & deaths curves look pretty flat, while testing is increasing parabolically, which is a good thing obviously.\n\nThere is plenty of data available for free if you are willing to look at it and make your own assumptions. However, it is in someone's benefit to spread the narrative of second way, but it is your duty as a functioning human being to do your own research and observe the world around you with your own eyes.\n\nNow there is another angle of the story, which is that many institutional and professional investors have missed the market bottom completely. At the same time many retail investors with much more flexible decision making have bought in somewhere near the bottom. And you just can't have that, that would discard the whole point of giving your money to mutual funds and wealth management companies. But let's leave that for now, that requires another wall of text. If there is a demand I could continue for part2.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion/opinion/TLDR:** as testing increases so does the cases. You can even see that testing is increasing more rapidly than the cases, meaning that the overall spread is calming down. Pockets of US are incresing in positive cases, while other pockets are decreasing, but media chose to be on the increasing side for now.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n [https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/USA-TRENDS/dgkvlgkrkpb/](https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/USA-TRENDS/dgkvlgkrkpb/) \n\n [https://covidtracking.com/](https://covidtracking.com/) \n\n [https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus/country/united-states?country=\\~USA](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus/country/united-states?country=~USA) \n\n**Positions:**\n\nLong SPY, IVR, WMC, AAL\n\nShort AMZN, APPL\n\nI'm european so no options in my region, just regular CFDs.", "created_utc": 1592048633.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h86073/market_insights_part_1/", "is_self": true}
