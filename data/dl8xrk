With such an over dramatic and negative view of Boeing, and a lot of people here saying to buy puts, this is *exactly* why now is a good time for calls. It's fucking Boeing too. It's not going anywhere. It will come back, as will their planes. It's a matter of when. \n\nEarnings is on Wednesday. What matter more than anything is their guidance. If Boeing can do a good job with guidance, we can expect a pretty significant bounce back. Puts are a bad idea, especially with how far it's dropped already. Either hold or buy. \n\nCalls are on a fire sale right now. Buy some for mid to late November.", "created_utc": 1571700546, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dl8xrk/ba_is_one_the_best_plays_right_now/", "is_self": true}
