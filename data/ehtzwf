So, naturally I thought to myself, what then happened in 1998? Sure enough I found an H1 run up and then all those gains got wiped out by August. \n\nSo here\u2019s the strategy; sit this week out. It\u2019s gonna be sideways or slightly down. Calls, monthlies starting next Monday. Work it all the way until about August, September if you\u2019re feeling frisky. \n\nMango man gonna take the L on the White House. \nHe gonna dip out with his insane gains and let Kim Jung Sanders take the fall for the depression we boutta be in.", "created_utc": 1577748025, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ehtzwf/2020_is_the_new_1998/", "is_self": true}
