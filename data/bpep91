{"id": "bpep91", "title": "Impossible Burger Recall as it relates to BYND", "selftext": "Alright- one more post on BYND. Sorry for boring everyone. For those that didn't catch CNBC this morning, they had Pat LaFrieda on. They are meat purveyors that supply many michelin star rated restaurants, Shake Shak, and others. I think they have $200m in annual revenue? Anyway, for meat alternatives, LaFrieda buys from Impossible Meats. Apparently in March, Impossible Meats had a voluntary recall due to a customer finding plastic in the meat. Whatever. This is old news. However- Lafrieda mentioned that since the recall, many of Impossible Meats' customers needed supplies of meat-alternative and turned to Beyond Meat: Including LaFrieda. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPersonally, I don't know if it will be a long lasting switch... Maybe some customers will be more comfortable with BYND's ability to supply vs. Impossible Meats? But I think this could positively affect BYND's first earnings report out of the gate and maybe boost guidance. In their S1 they gave preliminary figures for 1Q19 of $38-40m in revenue. I don't know when they will report, unfortunately. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSecondly, Impossible Meats raised $300m privately and says they have no desire to go public soon. Good for BYND since it remains the only publicly-traded pure play on meat alternative.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThirdly: I'm sure you all saw yesterday that Tim Horton's is testing BYND's sausage. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly: We finally got info on % of float being short. It is about 1/3 of the 10m flat being short and borrow rates are between 37% - 60% based on the broker. \n\nDisclaimer:\n\nI DO NOT EXPECT THIS TO BE A GOOD LONG TERM INVESTMENT AND THE VALUATION IS INSANE.", "created_utc": 1558024189, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bpep91/impossible_burger_recall_as_it_relates_to_bynd/", "is_self": true}
