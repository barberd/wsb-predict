{"id": "dsn5ec", "title": "Bogleheads vs WSB", "selftext": "Found you guys from r/all after all that GUHfuckle made this sub infamous. I invest in the stock market but I subscribe to the age old BUY and HOLD 3 ETF/mutual fund portfolio strategy that is idolized by r/Bogleheads. It is interesting to me that WSB has 713k subscribers whereas bogleheads only has like 14.4k. Is it the rush of options/margins, etc that drives people to the WSB type of investing? Is it kind of like a get-rich-quick type of thing? I get that the boglehead strategy is neither exciting nor quick, but I do think it works long term. Granted I may be generalizing a large group of people based on the RH glitch situation, so please correct me.", "created_utc": 1573076680, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dsn5ec/bogleheads_vs_wsb/", "is_self": true}
