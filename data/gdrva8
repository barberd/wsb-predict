{"id": "gdrva8", "title": "I strongly recommend that you not cuck yourself by betting against Zillow $Z $ZG", "selftext": "**OK you autistic fucks, let's gather around and hash this Zillow bullshit out once and for all.**  I have been employed as a data scientist at Zillow in Seattle for several years (and still am currently)...using an old throwaway here for obvious reasons.  We're gonna start with why Zillow got into iBuying, bounce off why neither iBuying nor Corona is not even going to come CLOSE to killing us, and finish with why you should probably buy some fucking LEAPs.\n\n(This post is in response to some recent grade-A retard bullshit going around this sub about Zillow, namely: https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gdbzyn/home_sales_to_fall_up_to_60/ and https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gdkvqf/dd_from_5254_zillow_next_leg_down_oil_reminder/)\n\n**WHY ZILLOW OFFERS**\n\nEverybody wants to be so quick to act as smart as fucking Jim Cramer and bash us for getting into iBuying a few years ago.  \"Oh you are a media company, why are you trying to fuck with physical assets.\"  Anyone who said this is a moron who was not capable at seeing the writing on the wall regarding our \"media\" business.  In short, it was plateauing, and we knew it.  There is a hard ceiling for what agents are willing to pay for a lead, and when you multiply how many \"online\" agents there are by how many transactions they do per year, a fucking 6 year old could calculate what our topline revenue was going to cap out at.  We did that calculation about 4 fucking years ago, and we were like \"hey maybe we should do something else before our growth fucking goes to zero and everyone gives up on us as a tech company\".  **In this scenario, iBuying is a natural evolutionary step for us to open up revenue growth.**\n\nImportantly, it gives us access to a revenue stream up the experience and competency curve for home buyers.  The vast majority of our ad revenue comes from connecting first-time home buyers to the first agent they have ever worked with.  Once they develop that relationship, they are highly likely to use that agent again without us being able to trim another slice of revenue off.  So we needed to get access to repeat buyers, and through the selling process is the best way.  I will come back to how this is important later, but having something on your website to engage with repeat buyers is the key here to unlocking Zillow 2.0.\n\n\n**WHY THE CORONA SHUTDOWN AND FALLING HOME VALUES OF ZO-OWNED HOMES IS NOT GOING TO KILL US**\n\n**ZO is financially engineered to be impossible to kill our parent company (Zillow Group)**.  I know /u/amped242424, /u/Matth3wlim, and /u/expander2 think they are the HOT SHIT for having the 3rd-grade-level ability to read the \"Total Liabilities\" line on a balance sheet, but they obviously know nothing about real financing for a competent company.  If you are having trouble wrapping your brain about how this works, why don't you fucking start by googling \"nonrecourse debt\" and come back to the table when you understand.  Basically, the loans that we took out for these properties are contained inside special-purpose financing vehicles that are tied ONLY to the underlying homes.  If we wake up tomorrow and decided that holding all these properties was going to fuck us, we could walk away from every single home we own and tell our creditors to shove those houses up their collective assholes.  These facilities were designed this way ON FUCKING PURPOSE FOR EXACTLY THIS KIND OF FUCKING DOOMSDAY SCENARIO because we have a wicked smaht group of finance people and executives.  \n\nWe also have a gigantic pile of cash that we are sitting on, mostly from a set of financing that our previous CEO (rockstar Spencer \"S-Money\" Rascoff) got nailed down right before we put ZO into hyperdrive.  This cash came from a combination of selling new stock and new convertible bonds.  Most of you fucking autists are only capable of comprehending dumbassery like you see over at $TSLA, so you see convertible bond and you think \"well if the stock isn't >420.69 the bond holders will just demand the money back instead\" but **you would be so so so fucking wrong.**  Unlike every other death-cult-tech-company bond out there, this conversion is at OUR option, not the note holders.  So if we blow all our cash on hookers before the note comes due, we just run the Xerox machine for a couple hours and hand out some newly minted common shares.  Again, all this information is available to you if you fucking read our SEC filings and investor reports instead of just skimming the Company Statistics page on Yahoo Finance.  \n\nSo we had to pause buying ZO houses for the 'Rona...who gives a fuck?  Unlike oPenDoOr and oFFerPad, we have a cash-flow-positive media business that is continuing to hum along quite nicely in the background.  We aren't slaves to the VC cycle where if you haven't shown 100% revenue growth in 18 months, you can't raise your next round, and are fucked because you aren't cash flow positive.  (And lets be absolutely crystal clear...nobody gives a FUCK if you are profitable or not...CASH IS KING and if you are cash flow positive as a tech company then you never have to raise another round of financing ever again..........OD and OP are not cash flow postive: get shrecked assholes, and your investors with you.  Especially Keith Rabois.  Fuck that guy.)\n\n\n\n**WHY ZO IS GOING TO TAKE Z/ZG FROM ~40/share TO THE FUCKING MOON**\n\nI told you I would come back to why ZO is important: **for its ability to engage repeat buyers.**  So lets fucking go.  \n\nFor a home owner who wants to buy another house, selling a home FUCKING SUCKS ASS, and experienced sellers know this. ESPECIALLY when you have to sell your starter home to a first time buyer; I cannot stress enough how much of a PAIN IN THE FUCKING ASS it is to sell a house to a fucking first time home buyer.  They are LITERALLY THE FUCKING WORST PEOPLE IN THE UNIVERSE, wanting everything in the world on this starter house to be spic and span.  Like, fucking learn to repaint a room, you fucking children.  Let me summarize a typical ZO customer: \"This house is worth 100k more than I paid for it...I think I would give up 20k of that to not have to deal with the WHINY ASS CHILDREN [and their shitty agents...who are always 55+ Karens with fucking Comic Sans in their email signature and who STILL haven't figured out how to use e-signature software yet, it's fucking 2020 bitch, get with it] who want to buy it.\"  So we have someone who has significant motivation to sell asking us what the zero-hassle selling price is for their house.  I am sure that even among the special group of retards we have assembled here, it will not surprise you to learn than >90% of people who initially press the sell to Zillow button on our site see our renovation-adjusted lowball offer and tell us to fuck off.  HOWEVER, we have now had an opportunity (which is a parallel part of the ZO evaluation process) to have a conventional real estate agent present a comparative market analysis to this highly motivated seller, and this agent has already agreed to pay us a significant referral fee if the seller ends up listing and selling in the open market instead.  If you are not educated on the real estate industry (LOL of course you aren't you fucking retard, you are 5 paragraphs deep in some rando's post on WSB) then you don't know how much that lead is worth...so I'll tell you.  On a 200k house, an industry standard value for a consummated seller lead is ~$2k.  (We do not charge even CLOSE to this yet, b/c ZO is still under construction.)  Keep in mind that we have had to do almost NO WORK to get this lead into our funnel.  Unlike Opendoor or Offerpad or PimpMyHouseUP or whatever flashy VC-funded iBuyer is in vogue this week--who has to spend GOBS AND GOBS of money on broad spectrum media to get sellers on their site and into their funnel--Zillow has FUCKING TENS OF MILLIONS OF HOME-OWNING VISITORS A MONTH on our site already, because we have already built a monster consumer media machine.  So eventually we can pass off that seller lead WHICH WE PAID NOTHING FOR to an agent for several thousand dollars in pure \">90% gross margin like only a Software Company can do\" fashion.\n\nBut wait, what if Susan (the seller) really wants out now, and is willing to pay a fee (usually the difference nets out to 300 basis points of her home value, $400k house this is ~$12k) for a service (not having to deal with any listing shenanigans, she picks a closing date and we show up with cash) so that she move on with her life and into her new house?  Remember, these are REPEAT home BUYERS...they have to go somewhere after they sell.  Then ZO is there, with certainty and cash.  And (and this is the BIG and, the ABSOLUTE biggest of ands, the FUCKING __AND__ YOU HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR) we are right there with ASSOCIATED HOME AND MOVING RELATED SERVICES LIKE A MORTGAGE.\n\nDID YOU FORGET THAT ZILLOW BOUGHT A MORTGAGE COMPANY?  Of course, you fucking never knew in the first place, because you never actually read any of our SEC filings, we established that earlier.  It has definitely taken longer than we anticipated to modernize, but eventually we will be offering best-in-class incentives to use our mortgages and associated services, which will allow us to capture HUNDREDS OF ADDITIONAL BASIS POINTS per loan from sellers who want us to streamline the whole transaction for them.  \"Oh if I sell to ZO and use a Zillow Mortgage to buy my next house, they will give me $4k in credits to closing costs? And I never have to deal with a buyer ever? DONE.\"\n\nAnd we get to do all of the above without building out any significant new ad spend or marketing funnels, just by ADDING A BUTTON TO OUR WEBSITE.  I mean, the button has to WORK, for like a couple thousand people a month, but that's just an implementation detail.  ZO is going to unlock growth that is orders of magnitude larger than our current \"media business\" and allow us to get our fingers into all kinds of valuable parts of the transaction that we didn't have access to before.  \n\n\nSo, TL:DR: Zillow's core ad business was almost at its wits end.  Getting into iBuying was inevitable.  ZO debt is non-recourse and even crashing home prices due to the 'Rona cannot kill us.  If we don't die, we win, because we now will engulf seller leads and moving-related services in the parts of the industry that we did not have access to before.\n\nAs a Zillow Group employee, I am prohibited from trading options, or transacting our stock outside of quarterly vesting windows.  However, I do have the opportunity every year of receiving my incentive grant of Zillow shares in options instead of RSUs.  And as of this year, I am now the proud holder of what are essentially Z $48c jan'2030 options, at 3x my normal allotment of shares.  So make your own decisions, but I would not recommend betting against us.", "created_utc": 1588656564.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gdrva8/i_strongly_recommend_that_you_not_cuck_yourself/", "is_self": true}
