{"id": "bc4wxz", "title": "What should I do with $40k in my checking acct?", "selftext": "Hi guys, \n\nSo I\u2019m a 27 year old girl with no experience in financial planning. The only experience I have is that back in 2015 when the market fell (August of 2015), I had about $9,000 that a family member left me and I decided for some reason to put in an E*Trade account and invest all of it. I knew nothing about the market. I just started reading some articles on The Street and literally just picked some random stocks. I mainly bought Facebook, Apple, BIDU, BABA, and some other random things. Anyway, fast forward to today and that $9,000 is worth about $25,356 - and I haven\u2019t sold anything yet. \n\nRecently I left a job and was given a severance package that\u2019s $41,000 - it\u2019s just sitting in my checking account. I have another $12,000 in savings and a decent paycheck every month, so I think that I would like to invest $40,000. I would like to invest in something steady, but really don\u2019t think I can sit here and trade stocks on E*Trade like I randomly (and relatively carelessly) did in 2015. So what\u2019s the best way for me invest it?? \n\nAgain, I know little to NOTHING about financial planning. I just know that I\u2019ve never had this much money just sitting in my checking account. Should I put it in some Fidelity account? Which one? What are they even called. Christ, I know I sound so stupid. So where\u2019s the best place for me to put it? I don\u2019t mind a little bit of a risk as long as it\u2019s relatively safe. Please don\u2019t roll your eyes at me. \n\nAny advice or direction to do my own homework would be greatly appreciated.
