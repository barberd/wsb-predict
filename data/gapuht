{"id": "gapuht", "title": "MI DD free tuition for Frontline workers", "selftext": "MI's governor said on Wednesday that Frontline workers get free degrees. Not all essential workers are covered and it only goes for people who don't have a degree.  Grocery store workers are covered. That means anybody who gets a job at a grocery store gets a potential six figure sign on bonus. In the past, tuition benefits have been transferrable to spouses and Kids. The program is going to cause a massive spike in people applying to grocery stores. You work for six months or a year or w/e they end up requiring to qualify and then you are off to college on taxpayer dime for the next 60 years part time. Even though everyone is gonna die next week to Corona virus, you gotta respect the potential gains here.\n\nThere is a second way to play this but it is more scummy and involves a pyramid scheme.\n\nFirst you buy an abandoned building in Detroit. Next order as many pallets of toilet paper and masks as you can afford and tell incorporate your new grocery store. Next you offer to sell business opportunities that are disguised as someone becoming a front line organic high end toilet paper salesman. You charge $1000 per toilet paper package and act as the distributor to your downstream. This alone is enough to make a decent profit if you have a couple hundred people sign on. And why wouldnt they? Even tho you are scalping them, they get free education and a bag of toilet paper for $1000.\n\nBut the real money is made when you permit your downstream to become distributors as well. There is a %price increase at each downstream level which fuels healthy profit margins at each level. You keep getting the same $1000 because you only distribute to the first level but the quantity that you move increases exponentially. The pyramid can build up until the point that the business opportunity costs around the same amount as college education and a bag of toilet paper.  If we estimate that at around $100000 then you can support 48 levels at a 10% profit margin made at each level for the investors and you make $1000 off every toilet paper bag that moves through the system.", "created_utc": 1588225098.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gapuht/mi_dd_free_tuition_for_frontline_workers/", "is_self": true}
