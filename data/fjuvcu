{"id": "fjuvcu", "title": "Second day of my ordeals with Robinhood", "selftext": "I shared this post over the weekend about how Robinhood purchased $310,000 worth of shares on my behalf without me placing an order for it, and issuing a margin call and locking down my account. No, I didn\u2019t have any spreads or even calls or puts on these companies. \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fivlm3/robinhood\\_purchased\\_1000\\_shares\\_of\\_biib\\_on\\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fivlm3/robinhood_purchased_1000_shares_of_biib_on_my/)\n\nSo here's Day 2 of what happened next. \n\nI sent them emails with screenshots on Friday. They still haven't responded to me yet. My account is still locked out. I can't trade. Can't close my existing call credit spreads (to capture this huge down move) either because of the app alerting me on buying power requirement. On the positive note, it appears they have reversed BIIB stock purchase but INTC is still there. My buying power has improved from negative 300k to negative 5k. \n\nHave no idea what's going on. Haven't heard a word back from them.\n\nIts one thing to read other people's terrible experiences with RH here on wsb but it's another thing to go through that ordeal yourself. You feel so helpless when your money is stuck and you don't even get an email response from your brokerage, let alone a phone call. This was my lesson learned. Already moved over to ToS now. Do it guys, while you still can. If you play spreads on Options, then do it even faster.", "created_utc": 1584401699.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjuvcu/second_day_of_my_ordeals_with_robinhood/", "is_self": true}
