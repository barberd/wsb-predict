Some speculation also went on over at 4chan, see image 2.\n\n[Speculation about Brime\\(?\\)](https://preview.redd.it/6u9gt9zipu751.png?width=1731&format=png&auto=webp&s=874b51498d92989cd5608fecc80d29b1b19647b8)\n\nIn this thread, it is speculated that a new streaming platform from Spotify is currently in the works. This would make sense for streamers to be able to play music without any worries for copyright infrigement. Also, when looking up [spotify-gaming.com](https://spotify-gaming.com), Spotify AB is listed as the current owner, see image 3.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Spotify AB owns spotify-gaming.com](https://preview.redd.it/0tmr33h3qu751.png?width=757&format=png&auto=webp&s=76f0f9df90c4ee6a7e646cfcd58bbb47eb21b606)\n\nObviously, it is unclear if Spotify AB is really behind Brime and if they are able to build a economical business model with it.  \n\n\nWhat do you think about all this?", "created_utc": 1593437621.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hhzx8a/discussionspeculation_about_brime/", "is_self": true}
