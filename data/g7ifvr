Today, there was an $80k OTM earnings bet, now why is this interesting?\n\nWell this is a low volume stock, which means it is odd to have such a large volume buy on this stock which leads me to believe that this bet was an insider, and they know how the earnings report will go.\n\nCSOD is a cloud-based learning & talent management company, obviously this virus gives them an activity boost, we will get to that soon; However, last conference call this quote is very interesting:\n\n> we have not modeled any of the potential revenue opportunities in determining the medium term value of the deal.\n\nThis is in reference to Saba, a newly acquired business that will do this for CSOD:\n\n> Our new company will have more software developers, more talent specialists and more expertise to support an expanded client community of over $75 million users in approximately 7,000 organizations of all sizes around the globe. and By way of background, Saba has a complimentary product portfolio to Cornerstone with approximately 3,300 clients and a global revenue footprint in 2019 of over $260 million. The company today looks very different from the last time they were visible in the public markets. You might remember that they went private in 2015 after a long history as a learning management company.\n\nOh so that isn't enough to convince you? Well how about this:\n\n> The logins from 40 percent of Cornerstone Learning clients rose during March compared to February. The average company\u2019s logins spiked 135 percent. \n\n> By industry, login increases came from nearly 60 percent of healthcare clients and 50 percent of those in public administration, education and non-profits. \n\n> Cornerstone found a 50-percent increase in the number of companies transitioning their in-person training to online formats. The verticals most affected were healthcare, finance and education.\n\n> The increased focus on online learning is global. Organizations in Spain, Germany and the Netherlands generated a near-doubling of their LMS usage January to March. In South Korea, there was a five-fold increase.\n\nOkay so the stats are telling us that $CSOD is experiencing unprecedented activity on their platforms. On a macro-scale, the US school system is already deciding to be remote for the second-half of 2020. This will be continued activity for $CSOD, AND on-top of that, they just finalized this acquisition of Saba which the following is not known publicky: **potential revenue growth from this acquisition hasn't even been modeled**!?\n\nThis leads me to believe that an insider has learned of the potential growth prospects over two major catalysts for CSOD: a) increased activity due to CORVID-19 & b) Saba revenue potenial models. Point A is important because of Snapchat, wait until they release new subscription numbers and activity impressions. Point B is important because investors have no clue what to expect, volatility will be here shortly.\n\nTLDR: $CSOD is incredibly undervalued at its current price of $30.69, before the crash they had a pretty steady share range of $55-$60. With the acquisition of Saba and their metrics through the fuckin' roof, they are going to be above $35-$40 by June (as long as we don't crash again xD).\n\n$CSOD May 15 - $32.50 calls\n\nyou're welcome for at least 100% gains, enjoy some burger king with me come May 11th\n\nedit: yes I misspelled the ticker on the title, but im drunk off tequila because of my $INTC put prediction payoff", "created_utc": 1587768598.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7ifvr/cornerstone_ondemand_csdo_dd_undervalued_gem_in_a/", "is_self": true}
