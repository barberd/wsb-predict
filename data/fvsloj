In the middle of Trump and Xi Jingping having a dick measuring contest based on their economic gains, you better believe trump will nuke your worthless puts if it means he has the edge on China. \n\nWe haven\u2019t hit peak yet. There are still many days left for the market to drop. One Green Day doesn\u2019t change the overall trajectory of the market or the facts of Covid-19 in USA and its consequences. If you\u2019re playing weekly puts, you deserve to go 0.
