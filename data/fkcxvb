The world is in chaos, MCD is getting robbed by the Hamberdergurlar, I can't wipe my ass, but HABT is holding at $13.75 since January 2020. Even if the contracts run to expiry and there's no price change, a $0.10 contract would net $15 each.\n\nEasy, right? HABT is going down and they're gonna burn in hell come ER time 3/20 or 3/27 or whenever they figure out a good day for bad news.\n\nAfter I slowly load up on all the low priced options ranging from $0.10-$0.45, I feel fucking great. I beat the MM and their system, and I'm gonna get rich. RH popped off a few times and randomly showed 3000% returns. I'll finally be able to buy my mom a tendie now.\n\nWrong. HABT sold to Yum for $14/share of all common stock so that shit is not moving on purpose. Fuck me. After crying away my shame and regret at being the biggest retard in the market, I noticed there was an ask for 6 x $0.50. Someone wanted the options and for a profit. Even though it was my last day trade before being marked as a PDT, I put up my 46 contracts for $0.45. Instantly, 6 were sold off for $0.50. 39 sold for $0.45 not that long after. I sold the remaining one for $0.35 the following day. Not sure about the exact total amount, but I made nearly 100% gains off useless contracts.\n\nAs of today, there's an ask of $0.15 x 2 for $14P 4/17 with no bids.\n\n**TLDR and Moral of the story:** don't buy HABT options till after Q2 and you can sell useless contracts to other people who have no idea what they're doing like me.\n\nhttp://ir.habitburger.com/news-releases/news-release-details/yum-brands-acquire-habit-restaurants-inc?field_nir_news_date_value[min]=\n\nCurrent plays: OXY leaps for 1/2021, short term SPY calls, and your mom.", "created_utc": 1584478627.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkcxvb/dont_buy_habt_options_till_after_q2_2020/", "is_self": true}
