Coming from the private sub, let me enlighten you.\n\n/ES WEEKLY\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/DCLlTYf.jpg\n\nAs you can see by my chart, the Turnip Dipper points nearly exactly to the bottom, but the problem we have in utilizing the Turnip Dipper is that the support lines (SUY+HUY) used to divine future movements are muted in bull markets and were nearly impossible to forsee until RTI was derived by the algos.\n\n/ES WEEKLY WITH RTI\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/BGV2Yvg.jpg\n\nI know what you're thinking, but disregard the BGZ. As a function of the prophet, the BGZ appear when using RTI in a SOLO capacity. Overall, this should help you get a better picture of the situation and how the turnip dipper is used, but utilizing the NSI in conjunction with RTI truly brings out the support and removes the BGZ.\n\n/ES WEEKLY WITH RTI AND NSI (BGZ removed)\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/fJ5aJV5.jpg\n\nNow here is where the fully picture really comes into play. Using SGU (stocks go up) and SGD (stocks go down), I was able to derive the moving minute average (MMA) and cross reference it with the SMA (Sierra Madre Angina) and thus rocket my portfolio to a staggering gain of -88%.\n\nI don't know if you listened to Steve Jobs' final interview with Brian Fitzpatrick, but here is a transcript of the most important part.\n\nBrian: So tell me, how do you handle adversity?\nSteve: Well that's easy.\nBrian: Easy how?\nSteve: Don't be such a cutie pie.\nBrian: I'm afraid I don't follow. Sorry.\nSteve: You inverse the inverse, Brian, only then can you return to your natural state.\nBrian: ...\nSteve: What I mean to say is: Don't doubt your vibe.\n\n\n\n\nSO I lost my train of thought but before I head back to the private sub, I want so beg you not to confuse a turnip dipper with a mooning dog pattern (MDP for the cool cats like me). There is a difference!\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/2iIjv7r.png\n\n\nDiamond fucking hands.", "created_utc": 1585714318.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fssdzl/turnip_dippers_bear_markets_and_you/", "is_self": true}
