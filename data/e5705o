{"id": "e5705o", "title": "[UPDATE] How old are you degenerates?", "selftext": "First of all, thanks for all the responses. Turns out my friend was mostly right. The median age is 24 and the average with outliers removed is 24.9. With outliers the average age is about 26, but I suspect most of you who said 69 are fucking liars. Also, if you said anything over 100 or under 13 I just ignored it.\n\nI considered anything outside of 3 standard deviations an outlier, sorry boomers. [The graph](https://imgur.com/a/DbgdB8I) uses the data set with outliers removed. I have finals starting this week so I can\u2019t be fucked to do anything else. Feel free to message me if you want the excel sheet I used.\n\nLastly, since my friend and I agreed that I lost, here is proof that I bought puts of $DIS. I had to use all the gains from my last YOLO plus collect the change in my car\u2019s ashtray to afford it, my school loans don\u2019t come in for at least another month. I bought $140 put that expires on Dec 13th. Things were looking up this morning, but I have a feeling that the ghost of Walt Disney is coming for the last of my tendies.\n\nHere are more in-depth results if you give a shit:\n\nWith outliers\nAverage: 26.19\nMedian: 24\nSD: 10.55\nN = 141\n\nOutliers removed\nAverage: 24.92\nMedian: 24\nSD: 7.47\nN = 137\n\n[Here](https://imgur.com/a/DbgdB8I) is the link for the graph again and for proof.\n\nTLDR: The average age of WSB users is probably around 25 and most of you cucks are younger than I thought.", "created_utc": 1575326789, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e5705o/update_how_old_are_you_degenerates/", "is_self": true}
