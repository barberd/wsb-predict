{"id": "gcw8dk", "title": "HTZ & CAR potentially in big trouble", "selftext": "CAR reported it\u2019s revenue for April was down 80% from same time last year. I imagine once we see HTZ earnings they will fall between 65-75%, not quite as high as CAR. \n\nHTZ is a big player in the airport segment but also has replacement business at their local levels propping them up, where CAR is pretty much strictly limited to corporate and retail business. That\u2019s why I think they will get hit harder with negative growth. \n\nHowever, HTZ is in big trouble due to missed lease payments on April 27. They have until tomorrow to come up with a way to pay. Unfortunately, they can\u2019t just sell the cars because every dealership across the nation is closed and buyer demand is gone. They have no way to offload their inventory. They are heavily considering filing for bankruptcy after hiring corporate restructuring consultants. \n\nI know you\u2019re thinking they have fallen quite a bit and all this is already priced in after CAR reported it\u2019s earnings. But, if you look at CAR guidance, they think they are going to get even harder in the coming months even with reopenings in place. Along with this, Buffet announced he pulled out of airlines, I think we see these stocks follow another decline with the the airlines as they rely on the airport business to stay afloat. \n\nIf you have driven past any of these companies local stores, you will see they\u2019re loaded to the tits with cars and they are paying for space off site for all the other cars they can\u2019t hold on site. Side note to this: there was recently a large fire for one of these off site lots that caused a ton of damage to inventory. Projected at a $90 million loss for the three top dogs but HTZ got hit hardest. Most people think they\u2019re backed by insurance but they\u2019re self-insured, so this is a huge loss on top of the missed revenue. \n\nOn top of all of this bad news, HTZ isn\u2019t even a strong company to begin with. \n\nI don\u2019t see these companies weathering this storm without a bailout, but what do I know I\u2019m retarded. \n\nHTZ 4p 7/17", "created_utc": 1588532913.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gcw8dk/htz_car_potentially_in_big_trouble/", "is_self": true}
