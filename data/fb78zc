But casino knows the gambler. will never walk out with the money. \n\nI began playing again in Dec with $500. Up to this point I had lost over ten thousand in the market. (But during that, tens of thousands of gains and tens of thousands of losses)\n\nScottrade sucked me in, and I lost maybe 1~3k a year. I always knew I was gambling, and never allowed myself to touch margin or rent money.\n\nSo that cute $500 turned into 1000. I can't even remember what I bought, but no biggie. I've been here many times before. Then I won big on amzn. \n\n[Reverse Guh](https://giphy.com/gifs/hX0QvRiICaMQfOxMC3)\n\nThen Tesla happened. I suddenly had 15k in Robinhood and I was like jesus it's happening. I'm here again. In 6 years, I've been to 10k from 3 digits 5 separate times, and never managed to keep them. I always got overconfident and all-in something that'd go bust.\n\nI immediately transferred winnings into IRA, hoping to slow myself down and mitigate taxes after seeing WSBGod's IRA (maximized 2019 and 2020)\n\nI was there when [Tesla broke its ankle](https://imgur.com/dpfM8mg).\n\nThen Corona happened.\n\nIt's been an insane year. Part of me feel like I should've been more aggressive, but I kept to my rule of sizing.\n\nSo I kept it small, and somehow kept [winning.](https://imgur.com/u2R1sHe)\n\nand [winning.](https://imgur.com/yKKXypk)\n\nI am now up total [32k](https://imgur.com/bLckKiP) (8k in robinhood, 6k in another IRA untouched) since December 2019. 6400%.\n\nOnly 18k is [taxable.](https://imgur.com/igi6XIN)\n\n[All time chart](https://imgur.com/QVwqWM7)\n\nRight now I am holding 4k worth of short leaps into weekend. \n\nPart of me is like wow am I gonna make it to freedom?\n\nPart of me is like this money isn't real.\n\nI feel so high right now it's unreal. Even if I lose everything tomorrow, I think this experience was worth it.\n\nThanks for reading. I told my dad and he was like can I have 3k? I was like uh I'm not spending any til I hit 2 milly. He told then me to stfu about your gains until then lol. \n\nMy autistic trade [logs](https://imgur.com/NWRQCs4).
