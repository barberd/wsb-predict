The peer-to-peer payments app turned financial multitool is the No. 1 driver of its subscription and services segment, management said at the J.P. Morgan Global Technology, Media and Communications Conference. During that conference, CFO Amrita Ahuja noted the company's per-customer acquisition cost for Cash App is about $20. That's actually quite low relative to other financial services, and even compared to other apps.\n\n[Square\u2019s AI Platform Could Transform SQ Stock | May 13, 2019](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/square-ai-platform-could-transform-160927487.html)\n\nEloquent Labs is the developer of Elle, which can converse intelligently with a customer through a conventional online-chat platform without any human input from the service provider. While resolving complex customer-service needs remain currently out of reach, Elle can easily handle simpler-but-distracting tasks like returns and product-tracking.\n\n[Square teams up with Postmates for delivery partnership | May 9, 2019](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/square-teams-up-with-postmates-for-delivery-partnership-2019-05-09?siteid=yhoof2&amp;yptr=yahoo)\n\nThrough the arrangement, Square SQ, sellers will be able to use Postmates couriers to get goods to customers who call up to place orders or visit a store.

However, Square's bitcoin profits only accounted for about 0.2% of its gross profit during the quarter, versus less than 0.1% a year earlier. Square's bitcoin business won't move the needle anytime soon, but its top and bottom line growth is impressive, especially since bitcoin shed roughly 40% of its value over the past 12 months. If bitcoin's price rises again and it attracts more buyers, Square's bitcoin revenue and gross profits could surge much higher.\n\nInstead of viewing Square's bitcoin platform as a separate business, investors should see it as part of the company's long-term plan to lock users into its Cash App. Cash is one of the top peer-to-peer payment apps in the U.S. alongside PayPal's (NASDAQ: PYPL) Venmo and the bank-based Zelle, and it's still growing rapidly. Last quarter Square stated that its Cash App payment volume rose nearly 2.5 times annually. For comparison, PayPal stated that Venmo's payment volume rose 73% annually in its most recent quarter.\n\n[How Square's Cash App Makes Money (SQ) | May 6, 2019](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/company-insights/090916/how-square-cash-works-and-makes-money-sq.asp?utm_campaign=quote-yahoo&amp;utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;yptr=yahoo)\n\nSquare makes money from Cash App by charging businesses transaction fees for using its software. For a 1.5% transaction fee, individual users can expedite deposits to have them transferred immediately into their bank accounts instead of waiting the standard deposit time. They can also send personal payments from credit cards for a 3% transaction fee.\n\n[Village Financial Cooperative partners with Square to bring tech and education to the North Side | Apr 18, 2019](https://www.bizjournals.com/twincities/news/2019/04/18/village-financial-cooperative-partners-with-square.html?ana=yahoo&amp;yptr=yahoo)\n\nMinnesota\u2019s first black-led credit union is partnering with Square to bring financial education and technology to North Minneapolis.
