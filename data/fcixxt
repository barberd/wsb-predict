Analysts have been talking about it for months and have already taken it into account before any normal person got a whiff of what was going to happen.\n\nNow today\u2019s move is in no way a sign of recovery, we are far from that.\n\nA supply shortage to this level is unprecedented and will take targeted fiscal policy to get us out of it...\n\nBut all the bad news you\u2019ve heard, is priced in, it has to be worse than what is already expected.\n\nSo now we wait for economic numbers to gauge the true impact of the virus.\n\nGood luck, happy trading.\n\nPS: they hated on Jesus too", "created_utc": 1583182991, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcixxt/today_is_a_good_lesson_for_all_of_you/", "is_self": true}
