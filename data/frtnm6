People enjoying their lives, really excited about the Fed's balance sheet, and there's so much to be hopeful for. I heard that in 12-18 months we *might* have a vaccine for \ud83c\udf7a\ud83e\udda0. On Fox News they're saying fish tank cleaner cures AIDS. Amazon has even offered to pay their warehouse workers an extra 5 cents per hour.\n\nAnd by the way, let's all extend a warm WSB welcome to the all the normies from Barstool. We're so happy to have you here, and we strongly recommend you all buy quality stocks like Boeing and Ford (these companies are true American heroes).\n\nShout out to my friends, the CEOs of Walmart, Walgreens, CVS, Panera, and my dawg JPow who's been cranking hard on the printer lately to make our economy even better than it already was if you can believe it.\n\nedit: [positions (I have small pp)](https://i.imgur.com/8TUXo6l.png)", "created_utc": 1585584720.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frtnm6/such_an_incredible_time_to_be_alive/", "is_self": true}
