{"id": "gz5c6x", "title": "Up 2000% the last month, finally positive AT", "selftext": "I started trading a year ago with 2,300$, turned that into 2,700$ buying stonks. I stumbled upon WSB and put everything into options right before the crash. My all time low was 120$ but I scraped my way back mostly by YOLOing BABA calls. I also have some CCL and LUV calls that have printed for me.\n\nThinking about quitting options but this last month has been insanely fun. I know it's gambling but I hate the idea of stopping. Probably gonna keep gambling and cut my losses if I drop back below 2k. I guess my advice would be if you're down big and you have a play you really like, YOLO that shit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f3xrp9qyfq351.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8824a26a332c8802abc6f5fb080832a2907c00e", "created_utc": 1591642336.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gz5c6x/up_2000_the_last_month_finally_positive_at/", "is_self": true}
