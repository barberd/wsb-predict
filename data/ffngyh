{"id": "ffngyh", "title": "How to profit more off Gold and Oil", "selftext": "It needs to be known that the two are typically inversely proportional.  The two largest COGs of gold mining are labor and the price of oil (considering most equipment is owned).  \n\nWhen cost of labor is stagnant (immediate future) the price of gold is mostly reliant on the cost  of fuel/lubricant/hydraulic fluid.  Aka oil.\n\nWhat that means is that when oil goes up, gold goes down.  Check the commodities history, they are pretty close to the inverse of each other.\n\nYou can actually see that in action, right now.  Gold is rising while oil is tanking.  BUT WHAT DOES THAT ALL MEAN?!  \n\nWhat it means is that when you buy one of the two commodities, you're essentially investing in both, one way or the other.\n\nSo whether its gold calls or oil puts....buy whatever options are cheaper.  They will both move similarly in completely opposite directions.", "created_utc": 1583719823, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffngyh/how_to_profit_more_off_gold_and_oil/", "is_self": true}
