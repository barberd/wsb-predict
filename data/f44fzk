{"id": "f44fzk", "title": "SPCE fib extensions and retracements - so you can know where the sell spots are. (And I'm a long term bull)", "selftext": "What's up, guys.\n  \nI'm a full-time trader that lurks here on occasion.\n  \nA little background info; used to own an online art business - sold the company and moved into full-time trading after successfully trading on the side for three years.\n  \nThis is my job, literally.  I have no other job but trading on the daily.  I plan on posting some of my trades here more often so others can see what I'm doing.  Check my account history and you'll see some of my TSLA trades from last few days.\n  \nAnywho -\n  \nRegarding SPCE:\n  \nLong-term bull here.  But yes it does need a pullback again eventually (just like the 20 &gt; 16 pullback).  So it would be behooving to of course sell the top and buy the next level of support.\n  \nThis is what I see for fib extensions and fib retracements:\n  \nhttps://imgur.com/a/e9Hu3aC\n  \nIn after hours it passed that 29.36 fib but yet it didn't close above it.  If it clears that you can see that the run can clearly take us to the $37 level.  And with all of the hype, it probably will.\n  \nFrom there it should come back down, break below the $29 fib that it crossed (which will happen on Tuesday), and retest the $24 fib.  If the $24 fib is unable to hold or act as support (and it probably wont, because it never made support there and just blew right through it), it'll have a quick flash crash down to the $20 fib which, in reality, should act as good support.  $20 was a level it failed at before, and then attempted to break on three other occasions, so it should hold there.  I dont think this stock will ever see lower than $20 again.  Ever.  I think that's the buy-in zone for anyone who missed this.\n  \nSo to break it down, my thoughts are -\n  \nIf it fails to get above $29, sell it.  If it breaks above $29, hold out for $35-$38 area.  Once there, sell, buy puts, right to the lower fibs and right even lower if it drops to next level.  Then, load the heck back up on your calls and equity positions.\n  \nAnd remember this:\n  \nIf you've done your DD on the stock and you WANT IN, don't be a ****** and watch it crash down to buy levels and then say \"nooo I'm too scared now it's going to crash it's a sham omg I will lose it all!\"  Buy.  The.  Supports.  Don't bitch out.\n  \nEnjoy the moon trip, boys.\n  \nOh, and just so you know I'm not just some clown that never bought into SPCE.  Here's my Jan 2021 calls that I bought January 10th:\n  \nhttps://imgur.com/a/vUhpqXY\n  \nPaid .90-.95 cents on each contract ;)", "created_utc": 1581740864, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f44fzk/spce_fib_extensions_and_retracements_so_you_can/", "is_self": true}
