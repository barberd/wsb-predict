{"id": "f6uwl1", "title": "$PLUG to the moon", "selftext": "My friend recently got a RH account and has been sending me trade ideas because he knows I have more funds available to trade and he wants to to get in on some of his \"Brilliant Trade Ideas\". I've been ignoring him as he's going through the first stage we all go through when we open a trading account right. But then he starts sending me screen shots of his trades. Little did i know this mother fucker is the second coming of the Oracle of fucking Omaha, but he's so retarded he doesn't even understand options yet. He only has like $700 in his account right now, but based on his picks he should have turned that into $10K by now. Anyway, I've started listening to the retard and his next pick is $PLUG. He gave me some elevator talk about their earning, blah blah blah. I'm like I don't care how you know, I'm jumping on that train brotha. Mar 13 $4 strike price calls plz. I even taught him how to use options so he can get some tendies.\n\nJust look at some of the shit he sent me yesterday.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/T6pOUve](https://imgur.com/a/T6pOUve)", "created_utc": 1582213552, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6uwl1/plug_to_the_moon/", "is_self": true}
