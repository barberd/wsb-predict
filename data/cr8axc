{"id": "cr8axc", "title": "Briefly a multimillionaire", "selftext": "So some of yall might remember from the daily thread this morning. But i had 100 SPY put credit spreads that got assigned wednesday at close. NBD, robinhood does their thing and i lose my collateral. i get this. \n\nI start checking my account, and all of a sudden it goes up 1k, then 2k. cool, maybe im getting some of my collateral back since some ppl arent exercising. Next thing I know, my account jumps up to $2.8 million dollars. Holy shit! thru some options magic fuckery, i made $2.8 million! \n\nBeing a responsible investor, i tried to withdraw this money but wasnt settled yet. ok NBD. I'll just invest it in MSFT. It's down, but it'll go back up. So, i bought 20,000 shares of MSFT.\n\nDuring my sleepless night of staring at my $2.8 million account, I came to the realization that my logic was most flawed. And then dread. Fuck, i just spent 2.8 mil of someone else's money. \n\nok okok. ill just sell the 20,000 shares of MSFT Thursday morning. Sold them. Even made $7k. nice. \n\nNext comes lots of back and forth emails with RH and my account doing fucky things all day. Finally, this morning, it's all resolved. RH \"voids\" all the MSFT stuff somehow and I dont get to keep the 7k. they also removed options trading for me lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; put spreads gets assigned. RH sells 10,000 shares of SPY that i dont have and deposits the money into my account. I thought i hit jackpot and spend the money. RH takes back the money and the extra 7k i made with that money and blocks me from options trading.", "created_utc": 1565970871, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cr8axc/briefly_a_multimillionaire/", "is_self": true}
