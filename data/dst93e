The account had been shut down for at least 4 months but somehow RH STILL let me deposit 5k into the investment account. Idk if it\u2019s a glitch or not, but after about 5 days it corrected itself and withdrew the money from the market. What I can\u2019t seem to figure out is if they took the money out themselves or was it because my portfolio took a nose dive (sharp decline 8/21 - 8/23). \n\nAny thoughts? Also, after the correction was made, RH set my next mandatory deposit to 500 in order to add any additional funds (account negative rn)", "created_utc": 1573105376, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dst93e/extra_5k/", "is_self": true}
