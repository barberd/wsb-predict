{"id": "h8w7rt", "title": "Life savings cut in half. What should my next move be?", "selftext": "I saved around $3,000 in about 10 years working extra jobs like walmart and driving for uber. I heard from a friend about SQQQ and how it is a leverage against the nasdaq and made about 2k in March from that advice. I thought I could quit my part-time job at Stop and shop and put my focus on trading stocks and ultimately options. I was buying and selling SQQQ and then the nasdaq rose like a Phoenix from its ashes. After going back to my initial 3k investment I heard about tanker stocks so I put a good chunk into STNG puts and you know what happened. I have ~$1,500 left and want some advice on how to proceed. The highest rated comment will be my next move.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/9vTQo33", "created_utc": 1592149806.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h8w7rt/life_savings_cut_in_half_what_should_my_next_move/", "is_self": true}
