Next thing you know it\u2019s 5AM. The party is still going. People start to crash, however, you can\u2019t crash if you don\u2019t stop snorting. The coke train continues. 9AM, then 1PM. \n\nIt\u2019s 2:30 AM, and little does everyone know the party has a ways to go. The coke is the fucking printer. Bull fucking gang.
