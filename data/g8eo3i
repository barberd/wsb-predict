Here\u2019s my 2 cents on the market activity for this week, mostly obvious shit that retards like you won\u2019t consider:\n\nBig tech: Earnings will cause price fluctuations, but the movement won\u2019t be obvious. You think MSFT is going up because of there cloud bullshit? Well so does everyone else, it\u2019s PRiCeD In. The reverse is most likely true.\n\nSpy: It will struggle to go up more due to big tech mostly capping out. MSFT, AMZN are at or near ATH, and FB, Google both at around 85% of ath (coincidence? I think not; I made a good buck off of zuck the past few days). If your going to make a bet, remember that there is downward pressure at ATH. \n\nNow you might be asking, as an autistic, what the fuck do I do about this? Well, that\u2019s for you to figure out.
