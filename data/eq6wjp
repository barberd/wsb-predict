Looking for the groups opinion.\n\nTODAY: Strong price action sideways after initial move up today. Zooming in at the 15m candles, I see a bullish cup and handle forming that could take us well above $16 on Tuesday. Trickling higher AH. \n\nLONG TERM: Bullish reconfirmation of uptrend holding top resistance line \\~$14.5. We also have a recent cross of the 90d and 200d MAs, which traders love signalling a run on any stock. Bullish PMC \\[persons indicator\\] showing higher level of outperformance against NASDAQ. Downside to this chart is that RSI is highest it's ever been \\[86 vs, 85 previously in October\\] and volume was weaker that I would have liked to see today \\[MLK holiday Monday might explain some of it\\]. Keep in mind, stocks can remain overbought for a long time if there is enough volume, so that is my only concern with this stock today. \n\n*Processing img 11zng2qmqeb41...*", "created_utc": 1579296914, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eq6wjp/thoughts_on_buying_a_hyped_space_flight_company/", "is_self": true}
