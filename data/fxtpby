Then trying to play options to protect my long position but timings all fucked.  Yeah I know not to time the market or whatever but it\u2019s very tempting looking at the movements we have.  \n\nStarted investing around 3 years ago and probably loss over 30K in my personal account.  \nMean while my Roth and 401K barely took a hit during this time. Roth(MSFT@107, LULU@167).  \n  \nJust loss another 1K this morning in 10 mins trying to ride the wave up.  \nFinally closed all my positions and just transferred all the money out of my personal investment.  \n\nJust don\u2019t think I\u2019m cut out for this and seeing how safer investments is definitely the way to go I think I\u2019ll just start from scratch again and put in $500 every pay check now and buy quality stocks and just let it grow.  \n\nKept using the excuse of having retirement accounts set up to trade very risky in my personal account.  Looks like I won\u2019t even be able to contribute to Roth IRA this year because I\u2019m running low on cash now.  \n  \nI know I\u2019m still young but I feel like losing 30K+ over the years just kept me in the same place as where I started where if I had safely invested those I would\u2019ve been in a way better place.  \n  \nTo anyone else still playing in this market. Props to you but I don\u2019t think I can handle this anymore. \n  \nPlease don\u2019t post suicide hotline number or whatever, I\u2019m not having negative thoughts. Just frustrated at myself for being so stupid trying to understand the market.  \n  \nOrdered a kindle couple days ago and should arrive today. Think I\u2019m just gonna take some time off and read or something.  \n  \nLet me know if u have any good finance related book or anything.  \n  \nThanks", "created_utc": 1586443685.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxtpby/a_rant_frustrated_at_myself/", "is_self": true}
