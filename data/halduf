My account was dwindling down at a 70% loss, so I placed my faith in /wsb. With my last $1200 I vowed to follow through with whatever advice that had the most upvotes, even if I didn't like it. Fuck you autist /goldcakes for telling me to buy spy calls, they lost almost half their value friday. So Saturday afternoon, I did what any other reasonable person would do.
