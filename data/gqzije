{"id": "gqzije", "title": "Gold Mines /w positions and plays", "selftext": "It seems that there is very little attention to the industry that is really thriving in the time of brrr-machine and beer virus: gold mines. In this post I\u2019ll lay out few general ideas and then dive into few particular stocks that I follow closely with proposed play strategies.\n\n1. Gold traded around 1500/oz in q4 2019 (1482 in fact) and it already jumped to low 1700\u2019s now. But even with such significant increase for gold itself \u2013 it\u2019s not that volatile in general. Gold Miners are quite the opposite: they basically multiply every shift in price of the gold itself. Even though what really maters is quarter average gold price \u2013 industry reacts like a bitch to every slight daily change of gold futures prices.\n\nHow to find great picks? You might think that the best ones are the ones with lowest cost production, right? Well, big daddies think otherwise. If a mine has total production cost (AISC) at 700 USD/oz and gold price rose from 1500 to 1700 \u2013 they see impressive 25% increase in profits. But if the company had AISC at 1100 they get delicious 50% increase. That\u2019s why institutionals are buying now gold miners which used to be complete shit. And they will be the first ones to sell them if gold price sways down.\n\n**TL/DR**: find previously shity barely profitable gold miners with high AISC: they will go up with higher gold prices even more than competition.\n\n2. Did beer virus impact mines directly? Well, yes. Many stable geniuses in many countries decided that a flu is too much to handle for miners who basically expose themselves to danger on a normal working day. And so many mines were shut down. For example, TORXF was brought to complete halt. The only big jurisdictions I know that had balls to continue operation in full power were russians, who couldn\u2019t give two fucks about health of their citizens, and kangaroos. Russian mines are heavily controlled by oligarchs so I didn\u2019t really dive into them, but it seems on paper that PLZL is a great company. Aussies seem to be the greatest pick right now: AUD was impacted by rush to dollar in March, which makes their production even lower cost for few months; they have giant balls yet they are stable jurisdiction, unlike many African countries which can nationalize mines just because fuck you.\n\n**TL/DR**: kangaroos have big enough balls to come on top of beer virus.\n\n3. Spot of the day: two mining stocks.GOLD \u2013 Barrick Gold. It is second largest producer in the world. It\u2019s a beautiful company with long history of fucking up the planet and human rights violations. They mostly operate in countries you never heard of. Such a beautiful company had no problem with forcing ~~slaves~~ workers to continue operations and they escaped corona basically unimpacted in terms of production stops. They have mid to high AISC (in q4 2019 \u2013 923USD/oz) so as the gold prices rose \u2013 institutions flocked to it. It recently rose to 7 year record of 28.5. Right now there is a big sell off due to gold prices dropping to 1720 from 1750. But it will likely retest heights. Recently Papua New Guinea made a big move against Barrick effectively nationalizing their mine (currently the case is in the court). This whole story is shady: the mine was owned half by Chinese company close to CCP. And, believe it or not, Australia is launching an offensive against China in mining sector: they give out credits to Oceania and south Africa trying to undercut China. And decision by PNG came in line with this race. PNG mine is big for Barrick but not the end of the world. Still, be cautious: court ruling of this case against Barrick might affect price on a short scale.\n\nPositions. Calls 28 on early June but pay attention to news.\n\nKL \u2013 Kirkland Lake Gold, nice polite Canadian company, opposite of Barrick. They operate in only two jurisdictions: Canada and Australia. Canadians did shut down mines in April and prices of KL did not fully recover after March margin call. But here is a catch missed by many: they only suffered 15 % decrease of production. Because their greatest asset is Fosterville in\u2026 you guessed \u2013 Australia. Fosterville is an actual gem: it had AISC of 315 USD/oz in the beginning of 2019, which is world lowest AISC for a single mine. But there is more to it. In January they acquired Detour mine. Deal was done all-shares and existing shareholders were diluted by 32%. The market didn\u2019t like it at all and stock price dropped from near to 50 to low 40 \u2013 38-39. One of the reasons why market didn\u2019t like it was because AISC of Detour was very high \u2013 around 1000, which was in contrary to the company previous strategy of low cost production. But this mine has tremendous volume \u2013 around 500 000 oz/year and it was very missmanaged. This acquisition increased total production expectancy of KL to 1.5+ kk oz/year. And the deal, which everyone hated at the time, with new gold prices is a great success. But today KL is trading at the same price it was when gold costed 1450-1500. Which means it will go up once people start calculating their next quarter results with more attention.\n\nPositions: for pussies: \\~42 early June; for gamblers: \\~44 on 08.06; for full retards: go above that.\n\n4. Wanna day trade? Put that alarm clock on and start watching Aussies and Europeans.\n\nPretty easy game: gold futures are traded almost 24/7, unlike stock exchanges of Europe, the US and Australia. If gold prices drop 1% - expect 3-5% drop in prices of gold stocks. Works all the time. Until it doesn\u2019t.\n\nAnd just for the lulz. Wanna see 50 bil company day trade? Here you go: VanEck on EVN.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cb0f69uaq4151.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&s=c78c9db1b4977142c47920340ba66fce3dd47afa\n\nWould love to discuss other gold mines as well in the comments.\n\nP.S.: If this all goes tits up - blame your mother and society, not me.", "created_utc": 1590508104.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gqzije/gold_mines_w_positions_and_plays/", "is_self": true}
