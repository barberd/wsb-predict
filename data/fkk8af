GTFO.\n\nWynn and MGM had said they were going to close before and the Cosmo announced yesterday but this is the big one.  I am still trying to find out when exactly is \"nonessential\".  But all the casinos and other large properties have to close.  Not sure how they plan to do that.  These hotels have a couple of hundred-thousand people in them at any time.  Sorry folks, get out, good luck finding a flight? WTF?\n\nMost casinos have stated that they will offer full pay and benefits for the full time of the shutdown.  All schools are already closed so at least it solves that issue.  All grocery stores and related establishments have been looted.  Good luck finding ammo and you can't buy a gun new because they can't get through to the feds for the background check.  Also, all exercise equipment is sold out.  I have no idea, don't ask.\n\nYes, I'm a Vegas local and for full disclosure, I have Puts on CZR $4 for 4/3.   Et tu, Brute?  Oh hell yeah.\n\nEDIT: The new logo sucks ", "created_utc": 1584508340.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkk8af/gov_orders_all_nevada_nonessential_biz_to_close/", "is_self": true}
