We cant let these raging homosexuals scare us with their \"emergency cut\" and market manipulation.     If they try to raise the market as a long position with a series of ups and downs resulting in a 1% gain over the course of 3 days I'm going to get bored and pissed off.", "created_utc": 1583290643, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fd6h1c/strangles_or_go_long_gonna_get_boring/", "is_self": true}
