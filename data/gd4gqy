Only now did I find out I now can... I WAS trying on Thursday to put in $20-30k into TSLA puts, for instance the 5/8 695P. But they never told me. I had to use my chump change on Friday in TOS for some nice profit. But if these fucks had let me know, when I was planning on it Thursday that option was at a price of $5. With 30k I could be around half a million by Monday or so. And now its at $35 almost and probably will shoot up too fast. Those fucks screwed me out of life changing money.", "created_utc": 1588564589.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gd4gqy/fuck_vanguard/", "is_self": true}
