{"id": "hbpb5m", "title": "Divide and conquer", "selftext": "There has been some conversation about the big hedge funds versus the retails traders. And the kangaroo meme just exploded like the Nazi's head in Raider of The Lost Ark. But honestly, brokers are making millions of dollars off of the retail traders. If someone switches to a different broker, then that is a loss of profit to the broker. There are lots of ways to compete; Robinhood really pushed retail trading into the commission-free era and the other brokers caught up. Brokers can also get better severs, hire the best IT nerds, update the UI, add research tools. There seem like sensible moves. Here's another: advertisement. I'm not talking about a big-tits blonde using Think Or Swim and sucking on a gold bar with dollar bills raining down. I'm talking about product placement, but even more hidden.\n\nAny retard can get an account on Reddit and join WSB. Maybe there are retards out there who work an 8-5 and their job is to search Reddit communities for posts about questions about stonks. They work for the broker. And then they always comment how the competitor is worse. Or how some other low-level broker, one that is not really a threat, and say how that one is better.\n\nI can't be alone in thinking this has become a common practice. Or maybe I'm a delusional autist.", "created_utc": 1592522233.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbpb5m/divide_and_conquer/", "is_self": true}
