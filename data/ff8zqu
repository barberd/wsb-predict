{"id": "ff8zqu", "title": "The supposed immunity of Netflix", "selftext": "It's been very intense trying to absorb dozens of articles about different industries and sectors, but one topic that keeps coming up in the media and is worth sounding off on is just how immune Netflix (and other streaming players) are to the downturn.  Because during epidemics people stay home and watch TV, blah blah blah.  It's not that simple.\n\nNetflix U.S. subscriber count as of late 2019 was $18 million, which is just under 20% of the U.S. population.  Considering that people from the same household usually share accounts, those subscriber counts can't grow much higher, no matter how severe the virus is.  Given that Nextflix is now competing with Amazon, Disney+ and fuck knows who else, if anything, their revenue *from subscriptions* will stay the same.  But their expenses will be affected, just like the rest of the country's, and their ability to produce content will be hurt just like other studios' (due to travel restrictions, actors and production staff being pissy, producers hesitating to finance big projects).\n\nIt should be even worse for Comcast (NBC), Disney (ESPN &amp; ABC), and other TV players, because so many advertisers will be hurting that the ad market will become very dry.\n\nTL/DR if you're just here for tendies: Netflix puts are not out of the question (nor are puts of any U.S. company, period).", "created_utc": 1583650617, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ff8zqu/the_supposed_immunity_of_netflix/", "is_self": true}
