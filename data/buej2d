But starting up production of the Model Y in 2019 allows Tesla to tap into the growing SUV segment sooner rather than later, while a Model S refresh would help it maintain or grow its share within the declining market for luxury sedans.\n\nThe company has barely begun to place orders for new equipment to manufacture the Model Y, employees said. And while Musk has suggested that Tesla would probably make the crossover SUV in Fremont, Tesla hasn\u2019t officially announced that preparations in the factory had begun.\n\nMaking way for Model Y production in Fremont will require Tesla to combine Model S and Model X production into one line, according to the insiders. These lines at the car plant take up a significant amount of floor space today, at least partly because the S and X are each made with a lot of parts. The Model X is particularly complicated to build \u2014 its features include falcon wing doors that open up, rather than out \u2014 leading Musk to liken it to a \u201cFaberge egg. \u201d\n\nIn addition to the Model Y, Tesla is planning on a full refresh of the Model S, which employees say will likely include an interior with the minimalist look and feel of the newer Model 3, the same drive units and seats used in the higher-end Model 3 and a battery that delivers 400 miles of range on a full charge.\n\nThe company is aiming for a September start of production for that Model S refresh.\n\nTesla did not respond to multiple requests for comment.", "created_utc": 1559135642, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/buej2d/tsla_rejiggering_fremont_factory_to_produce_model/", "is_self": true}
