{"id": "fa0thu", "title": "Why are there no North Korea ETFs?", "selftext": "Yo what is up with that? Think about it--North Korea sends workers to Russia/China to earn foreign currency for the government. Surely they must have brought back the Coronavirus with them, but no cases have been reported yet. If we could buy puts on a NK ETF then we could make mad $$$ when it falls at the first announcement of the coronavirus there. Plus I read an article (i.e. some guy on reddit told me) that if NK gets it they are beyond fucked with no technology, doctors or infrastructure to deal with it. Someone should really start a fund of the highest quality NK stonks and list it on the NYSE so we can print tendies when we first hear how bad it is there.", "created_utc": 1582753238, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fa0thu/why_are_there_no_north_korea_etfs/", "is_self": true}
