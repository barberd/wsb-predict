Say I have $100k notional and want to do a market neutral transaction to borrow money at the interest rate implied by calls (which should be around fed funds or something). What would each leg of the transaction look like and how would I go about rolling it? Also wouldn\u2019t 100k notional only let me borrow like 1.5k or some shit?
