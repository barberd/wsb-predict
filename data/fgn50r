They basically pussied out and said ppl who wanna get tested should definitely Not come to quest directly. Instead see a physician and he'll send samples. That was an entire switch up from what was sold to the public beforehand. We were basically fed fake news. I called quest diagnostics by me, and they said they're waiting on an update.
