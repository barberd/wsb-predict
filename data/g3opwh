{"id": "g3opwh", "title": "You can hold leveraged etfs for a long time.", "selftext": "Many people in this sub talk about how you should never hold leveraged etfs for multiple days, but that isn't always true. Here is a scenario normally used to explain issues with leveraged etfs:\n\nNormal etf\n100 >up 3%> 103 >down 4%> 98.88 >up 1%> 99.87\n\nLeveraged etf (3x)\n100 >up 9%> 109 >down 12%> 95.92 >up 1%> 96.88\n\nAs you can see the leverage is not helpful in a volatile market. If the market moves a lot in both directions you lose value. But there is another situation which is obvious but it isn't always mentioned:\n\nNormal etf\n100 >up 3%> 103 >up 3%> 106.1 >up 4%> 110.3\n\nLeveraged etf (3x)\n100 >up 9%> 109 >up 9%> 118.8 >up 12%> 133.1\n\nAs you can see the leveraged etf performed better than 3x the return of the standard. This is why long term charts of leveraged (positive...) etfs are usually better than 3x the normal etf over a long period of time.\n\nThat being said, funds in a long term etf can obviously go down a lot faster than the underlying, but at a time like this it may be wise to use leveraged etfs. Unless the market crashes again but I cannot predict that so I'll assume that markets will remain positive more than negative since they usually do.\n\nNot financial advice just a pro 3x opinion. \n\nTQQQ etc.", "created_utc": 1587221510.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g3opwh/you_can_hold_leveraged_etfs_for_a_long_time/", "is_self": true}
