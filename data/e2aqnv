{"id": "e2aqnv", "title": "Facebook is overvalued.", "selftext": "Facebook has one hand left to play. Instagram, an app that's going to be Frankenstein'd to shit just like FB. Snap literally has the future, youth, and they're buying shit and bigger consumer sheep than we were. People HATE Facebook and are starting to switch. Facebooks push towards Groups is proof they're desperate. Check out groups on FB... they suck massive ass, and will be even more toxic for Fake News in the 2020 election. That's not something worth betting on. There's an idea in the value that consumer attention is now all used up, you can only take away attention from Facebook or Google... TikTok can not be good for FB, even it if fails, it exposes how people aren't loyal to shit. Telegram is the new WhatsApp... \n\nI predict the Facebook replacement has already been founded in 2019. It will be like nothing we've seen before. It will be for the Born-Mobile generation. It will have the \"next-level\" to news feeds, it will be a personal network, it may even replace/save phone calls. \n\nAnd get this, they will not sell to Facebook.", "created_utc": 1574829512, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e2aqnv/facebook_is_overvalued/", "is_self": true}
