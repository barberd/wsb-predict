They said, due to the high level of volatility, starting 3:00pm (1 hour before close) or even earlier, they will try to close out all of those autistic positions that are at risk of being exercised without having sufficient funds in the account. From the way it sounds they are gonna be doing it manually so they might miss a couple of you autists, but if you want to play the quad witching hour on TD, better stay away from 3/20 exp.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr All in 3/23 SPY 260c at 3:00pm", "created_utc": 1584679560.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/floy8a/autists_on_quad_witching/", "is_self": true}
