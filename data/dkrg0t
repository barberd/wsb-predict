{"id": "dkrg0t", "title": "Verizon Earnings", "selftext": "What do you guys think about VZ earnings? Never traded them at all before, only noticed they have beat earnings last few quarters. However, they fell short of revenue gains in Q2 which reported that they ended that earnings day down a couple percent (I know, can\u2019t base expectations over past earnings but thought I\u2019d mention). VZ currently also has decent volume, at least better than some of the other companies reporting earnings this week.", "created_utc": 1571612669, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dkrg0t/verizon_earnings/", "is_self": true}
