{"id": "fmtkju", "title": "Timing of GILD", "selftext": "Hey autists, just some basic info for those of you yoloing on GILD. Remdesivir is currently in at least 7 clinical trials around the world. \n\n[https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=covid-19&term=remdesivir&cntry=&state=&city=&dist=](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=covid-19&term=remdesivir&cntry=&state=&city=&dist=)\n\nThese trials focus on COVID-19 patients with different disease severity. The estimated end date for these trials is between April 27th - May 1st. The primary outcomes of each of these trials are slightly different, but they all focus on whether they will shorten the disease course. Nobody is fooled that this is a cure for COVID-19, this is an immunological modifier that has the potential to shorten the disease course or lessen the disease severity.\n\nTime your p/c based on this information. Traditionally clinical trial results can wait months until they are publically announced. In this case, I expect them to be expedited through the FDA fairly quickly.\n\nas a side note, the Chinese studies plan to recruit 300-450 patients in their two studies in Wuhan and Beijing all the way until the end of April, and they say they have no new cases... hard to believe.\n\nTLDR: remdesivir trials end April 27th - May 1st. results of the trial will likely be public shortly after.", "created_utc": 1584849613.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmtkju/timing_of_gild/", "is_self": true}
