Have been trying to open up a brokerage account but RH requires a SSN which I don\u2019t have atm. Tried opening up an account with TD but once they realized that they can\u2019t open up a account for Swedish citizens they refused on giving any further help with anything (cheers). I\u2019m on a F1 student visa atm and just looking to get into trading and maybe putting in $500-1000 and the joy of going tits up. Anyone have a opinion or advice?", "created_utc": 1557608768, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bnh0yr/dumbass_nonus_college_student_looking_to_gain/", "is_self": true}
