{"id": "gn9ue4", "title": "Building SUPER PUTS", "selftext": "Alright everybody, time to put your money to good use. For this example (apply to any stocks you want to buy a put on), let's look at GSX, because you know that fraud shit is dropping today. Let's assume our starting stack is $1000. Using *super puts*, we make that $1000 act like $5000!\n\nWe want to open a *call credit spread* - I like the GSX 30c/25c 6/19 spread. Buying the 30c and selling the 25c gives a credit of $400 for $500 collateral, meaning that right now, you only lose $100 in buying power for each spread you open. So open 10 of these for your $1000 and you'll really have $5000 in cash collateral - meaning if these expire worthless, you've just got yourself a 5-bagger.\n\nOr in reality, set a close for $2.00 and if the price of the spread halves from 4.00 to 2.00, you've just made $2000!
