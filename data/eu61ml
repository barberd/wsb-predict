Pretty much the main supplier for everyone aside from INTC or some shit, and who gives a shit about those clowns who can't even break 10nm. It's rumored they'll be manufacturing with TSMC too.\n\n5nm/3nm? Only 2 boys going hard on this, globalfoundries and TSMC. What the fuck is even a goldenfoundry, imagine actually paying Singaporean wages when you can pay Taiwanese wages.  Also Samsung apparently has some foundry or some shit but who cares about those gooks. \n\nEDA big boys - CDNS and SNPS - pretty much decide the market and no one even knows about them. They pretty much engineer the entire back end flow of IC manufacturing. What is their #1 foundry partnership? You guessed it. They don't even use technology libs from other foundries. If their customers go with alternative foundries they will spend millions resolving quality issues related to incompatibility between tools.\n\nWhen market goes into 5nm/3nm, 2-3 years from now, I bet these niggas at TSMC will completely dominate the market. Oh and coronavirus doesn't affect it, Taiwan is a literal island, but people will be scared of it because it's China, so I'm betting FEB/MAR will be the best months to buy, then it's moon only.", "created_utc": 1580041304, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eu61ml/tsm/", "is_self": true}
