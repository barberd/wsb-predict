I've been super open about my bloomberg terminal, Shown that I've posted hundreds of thousands of real headlines even when they were against my positions. No shame, No bullshit. Got verified by homos for my TRADE TALKS ARE GOING WELL headlines. My sister's friend's kid's dog had an autism vaccination yesterday, so I didn't post the AMZN related headlines until I got home and got absolutely blasted on THC-A. By the way fuck anyone for telling me I should post links with sources to my Bloomberg headlines, like I'm trying to deceive people. This community actually means something to me and isn't just a fucking shitpost haven. I found a community for the first time in a long time and I like it here. I'm taking a break, I'm going to keep my shit to myself for a while. Maybe I'll post an end of year summary of all the bloomberg headlines I didn't post, for the doubters to shove up their assholes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for anyone who supported me and sent me good vibes, it truly does mean a lot and I take all of it to heart. I'll be around in general discussion and whatever else, still.", "created_utc": 1572010802, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dmxlkz/taking_a_break_from_posting_bloomberg_headlines/", "is_self": true}
