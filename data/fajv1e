Those red dots appear when there's a pricing struggle between the bears and straights. The market can't decide on a direction for the security, in this case its GDXJ, which is known for selling a shiny metal that people think is valuable for some reason. When red dots appear its like there's a tension in the market, and there can be a big breakout either way to break the tension.\n\nThis tension has been the longest pricing struggle we've seen in gold since March of '18. We saw a sharp break out upwards last week but had a correction back down these past few days. I don't know why. I do know that corona + QE should mean gold to the moon. Soon enough every inflation fear monger and doomsday prepper will be buying. So not a bad chance the pricing struggle ends with gold shooting up.
