It IPO'd back in September and touched 21. With 53% short interest this stock has the potential to squeeze and go parabolic with enough volume.  \n\nSDC just got a patent approved yesterday that says no clear aligner competitor can duplicate SDC's unique model for 18 years. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smile-direct-club-granted-patent-110658574.html  \n\nSDC today filed suit against competitor for its model. https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/04/29/2024276/0/en/Smile-Direct-Club-Files-Patent-Infringement-Complaint-Against-Candid.html  \n\nALGN is its biggest competitor at 17B valuation, while SDC is at 2.7B. Unknowns are how corona affects it long term.\n\nI think this breaks out to 15+ very soon. I have 5 and 10 calls for 10/16/2020. I'm up 400% currently and will let it ride.", "created_utc": 1588171887.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gaavvv/sdc_about_to_breakout/", "is_self": true}
