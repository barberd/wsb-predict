{"id": "hdtln1", "title": "VROOM IPO - Follow up", "selftext": "I wrote a shitty DD earlier that I am following up on as VROOM has continued to run. \n\nVroom is a used car retailer and e-commerce company that enables consumers to avoid the dealership and finance, purchase, and browse for their car of choice all through the Vroom platform. It also allows car owners to sell their own car on the platform. Vroom has a large inventory of cars that each come with a carfax vehicle history that will allow consumers to feel more comfortable about not having to inspect the car in person. \n\nI believe this play is strong for two reasons:\n\n1). Nearly every e-commerce company, regardless of financial stability, has seen an astronomical rise during this period. From Ebay, Wayfair, Etsy, even fucking Overstock, every single one has skyrocketed. Unlike some of these other shitty companies riding the corona wave, Vroom actually has solid financial footing. They reported 1.2 billion in revenue in 2019 up by 40% (plus they're backed by Bill Gates)\n\n2) The street loves to pump IPOs.  I don't need to go down the list do I? I have no doubt that Vroom will no different.\n\nLastly, a commenter on the last post mentioned that Vroom has a great executive team, led by Paul Hennesy (need I say more?) \n\nThere's not a lot of volume on these options because it was just made available for trading but I got the 7/17 70C.  \n\nLet's see what happens.", "created_utc": 1592837037.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hdtln1/vroom_ipo_follow_up/", "is_self": true}
