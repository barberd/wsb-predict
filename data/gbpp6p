{"id": "gbpp6p", "title": "Today was a good day +22k", "selftext": "Today was one of those days where everything went right (except for that last TSLA play). I definitely sold a bit too early on some of my positions but I\u2019d rather have that happen than be on the losing end.\n\nDeposited 12k into my new Roth last week, current sitting at 53k after one week. My other trading account went from 3k - 106k. I lost 30k chasing stupid trades because I closed too early and withdrew 30k from there also. \n\nWorking on chilling out and not getting pissed about selling too early. Parked some money in GLD and sold calls on it. Aside from that no open positions this weekend. I think the news will be critical in deciding what happens next week and I\u2019ll probably open a large futures position Sunday night. \n\nI\u2019m 26 with 235k to my name (saved money from my job). Quitting next week to start another business. It\u2019ll be public in 5 years and we can short it together. Feels good man.\n\nHave a good weekend everyone. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/X576f2I", "created_utc": 1588364873.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gbpp6p/today_was_a_good_day_22k/", "is_self": true}
