{"id": "fkn4u6", "title": "Puts on ALL movie theaters forever", "selftext": "Talking with my wife's boyfriend after they went on a date I ask him, \"arent you scared of going to the movies now?\"\n\nIn all seriousness, movie theaters were already struggling.  See AMC's stock.  Now they are literally enemy number 1 in staying healthy.  All entertainment companies have streaming platforms.\n\nHeres the call.  Apple and the streaming services will start selling a \"premium same day as it comes out it in theaters\" tier, with regular tiers only getting access 1 month later or something.  This is an commercial sector that will go away forever after this.  I'm not sad per se.  Just the tea leaves.\n\nTldr; puts on anything that deal directly with physical distribution of movies at a theater.\n\nHell short Snowcaps\n\nEdit: People are saying \"Don't by AMC cause it's too low already\".  Yes Autists i know, what i'm saying is the supply chain for all those properties will be affected, the employees will be affected.  Just my opinion. don't care really.\n\n2nd Edit: People are saying that theaters have always been signaled as dead...But they've predicted them with:\n1.) No ability to move that medium elsewhere - This is the right time for this.\n2.) No global health reason to make the shift - Remember if you go to the theater you are against humanity.  How long will that last?\n3.) People don't want to go to theaters anymore.  People do have big screens and internet.  I'd rather stay at home... fuck those crying kids in Deadpool 2.", "created_utc": 1584525580.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkn4u6/puts_on_all_movie_theaters_forever/", "is_self": true}
