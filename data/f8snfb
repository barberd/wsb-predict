Tejchjnicas;l Any;al,ysis and read a Bloofberg paragraph about stonks going tits up.\n\nDid some fund-a-mental anal-y-sis in your sister to confirm.\n\nAlgo monkeys were going bananas. $SPCE was headed towards Uranus (and not in a good way). $TSLA was getting screwed by MSM. The Glorious Lord Elon was surrounded on all sides.\n\nLike a fag, I ran and switched sides.\n\nHad longs with **magnificent tendies**, secured and went short. Closed like a fag upon receiving more trendies. Up 28% in total.\n\nConfession of crimes:\n\n* Not using Robin Hood\n* Securing Tendies instead of YOLOing\n* Switching sides instead of standing ground\n* Closing upon receiving more tendies\n* *\"Analysis\"*\n* Abandoning Lord Elon and Lord Branson\n\nOutcome:\n\n* Can finally afford a hooker that isn't your mother\n* Have a reason to post on WSB\n* More tendies\n\nThere is no denying my homosexuality and for that I'll sacrifice some of my tendies at the shrine of tendies (instead of hiring your mother) on behalf of all you autistic bastards who went long on $AMD/$ALLY/$MSFT.\n\n\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udd95\ud83c\udf0e", "created_utc": 1582557369, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8snfb/trigger_warning_severe_homosexuality_saw_stonks/", "is_self": true}
