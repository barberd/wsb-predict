Now, the stock has effectively rallied and is almost green.\n\nDo we wait and see if there's a downturn tomorrow? Or if there's a downturn today do we get cash and try to get into alternative positions?\n\nI don't think we're getting into our accounts today... The thing has been down for almost 3 hours now and we have zero progress. What are we going to get, 5 minutes worth of time to activate any trades?", "created_utc": 1583168927, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcf84f/dal_put_people_what_are_we_doing/", "is_self": true}
