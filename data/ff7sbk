I own long calls and shares.\n\nPros: 1) TEVA doesn't manufacture anything in China and any ingredients it does source from China can be sourced from other countries easily\n\n2) They sell drugs and lots of them, yes most are generic, but who the fuck cares, boomers buy a lot of generic drugs\n\n3) Israelis are good at business and only a matter of time before Teva gets discussed with this whole beer virus shit, since Israel is working on a vaccine/treatment and they will need someone to mass produce it\n\n4) Berkshire Hathaway/Warren Buffet is holding 43,249,295 shares from $16-18 cost, forgot exactly. Shares are now $10.30 down from $13.50 a couple weeks before beer virus dragged this down\n\n5) Based CEO all about cutting debt and costs ASAP\n\nThe YOLO is the New York opiate trial is beginning March 20. There is a very good chance TEVA will settle by then, and if that is the case this turd will be trending back towards $20 by the end of the year as a lot of risk will be gone. Look what happened to MNK although it is a turd and already back below $3. YOLO at your own risk.\n\nAny other good biopharma stonks you guys are looking at?
