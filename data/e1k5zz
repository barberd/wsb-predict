Big lots is undervalued currently at $19.42 with a fair value of $51.62.  They have open some new stores recently and is a stock I definitely see continuing to rise as they have good earnings compared to the market.  I was looking at a long call buy at $27.50 with a ppo of .05.  And then a short call at $25 with a ppo of .20 for December 20th.  I feel like the stock wont be shooting up until the earnings for the holidays are released.    If it stays below 23 by the 20th I will make $15.  But if it skyrockets up I will lose up to a max of -235.  So my risk reward is a really big difference. \n\nBut I'm a total autist that has no idea what hes doing so I was seeing if you guys could remind me how stupid I am.", "created_utc": 1574706100, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e1k5zz/stocks_big_call/", "is_self": true}
