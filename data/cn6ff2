Why did I get in back then? because I wanted to put my money where my dick was, and Tinder was the easiest way to bag a piece of pussy a guy could find.\n\nThey had, and still have, the online dating market dominated and that isn't going to change. Just think of all the girls who get unsolicited dick pics and stupid ass messages on Tinder. You think that would scare them away, right? Well it doesn't, and if that hasn't caused a mass exodus of users then I don't know what will. Tinder isn't going anywhere but up.\n\nHinge is the best dating app out there for finding a decent chick, which means it's also a super easy place to score a fun night because girls don't think a guy on Hinge is as scummy as the ones on Tinder. Spoiler alert: The same dudes are on both. That's double points for $MTCH. I met my gf on Hinge and she's cool, so that's cool. She's even cool with me not deleting the app because \"I'm a share holder and don't want to hurt the stock by deleting\".\n\n\nMTCH is also expanding in Asia and the Middle East so all those folks can now find someone to knock boots with without it being an arranged marriage. I'm pretty sure Mandy said the Muslim population focused app, Harmonica, was meant to match guys up with virgins in the afterlife. I'm not muslim, but I'm still gonna download it because it's not worth being wrong and missing out on virgins after I die. Like I said, I didn't pay too close attention during the call so that description may be a bit off.\n\n\nEver since I started lurking here I have started to check guys out more often, so I was stoked to hear about all the stuff MTCH does for gays. I bet the mods love that gay shit.\n\n\nSince I caught the autism here and I'm long $MTCH I decided to hedge my 700 shares by buying my first options play and went with some OTM calls. 8/16 $85s just made me extra tendies.\n\n\nNow go out there and buy some $MTCH for the long run and download all the apps and make a females profile so you can fap to shirtless pics of college dudes.", "created_utc": 1565187762, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cn6ff2/i_listened_to_the_mtch_earnings_call_so_you_didnt/", "is_self": true}
