Like the one, we have now. I have just been presuming the best way to do that was with puts on index futures, but I find myself trading too much and actually LOSING money.\n\nI think I need to cut the choppiness. Dollar-cost average, or what have you. I've been thinking I should buy index puts 6-18 months out and then cover them when theta starts to kick in. I realize I could make MORE  money timing short-term put buys right in the middle of a day of heavy losses, but those are rare.\n\nHow have YOU made money in bear markets? Have you put money in 3x index funds like SQQQ? Even bought OPTIONS on 3x funds?  Please contribute anything you like.
