{"id": "fl4spb", "title": "Treatment options coming ASAP for Covid-19. Please read.", "selftext": "There has recently been an uptick in promising drug treatments for Covid-19. The most recent research is narrowing in on the fact that treatment must take place in two phases. First is to give antivirals to patients in the early stages of the disease. Then once the patient develops ARDS, to give anti-inflammatories. The drugs used in each stage that have shown promise can be found below. \n\n**Antivirals**\n\nRemdesivir: main issue is cost (~$1K per day - Gilead)\n\nFavipiravir: Japan based drug. Has a huge supply, prob. enough to export \n\nLopinavir/Ritonavir: Used already vs HIV/AIDS (AbbVie)\n\n**Anti-Inflammatories**\n\nHydroxychloroquine/Chloroquine: Cytokine inhibitor (Sanofi/Bayer)\n\nActemra (tocilizumab): IL_6 inhibitor (Roche)\n\nKevzara (sarilumab): IL_6 inhibitor (Regeneron and Sanofi)\n\nTrump knows this but faces two hurdles. \n\n1. Cost of drug produced. \n\n2. Treatment approval from the FDA.\n\nTrump cleared the first hurdle by enacting the Defense Production Act of 1950 which allows him to give orders to the private sector to start production and control drug prices to prevent profiteering. (Ex. Gilead)\n\nIn regards to the second hurdle, Trump hinted earlier today in the press conference that he had some exciting news to share about the FDA tomorrow. Some leaked rumors are saying that he has secured conditional approval by the FDA to allow the use of the drugs above. If so, Trump has paved the way for the immediate scaling and treatment of Covid-19 in the US. This is huge and will have a large psychological impact on sentiment along with the recent stimulus passed.\n\nSPY calls at bottom tomorrow before the presser. Market is going to jump on the news during it.\n\nEdit: Source of rumors\n\nhttps://twitter.com/DrDenaGrayson/status/1240267808807833610\n\nhttps://twitter.com/weijia/status/1240456119270678530\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ChuckCallesto/status/1240448201100005376\n\nhttps://archive.fo/LjaA7", "created_utc": 1584596531.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fl4spb/treatment_options_coming_asap_for_covid19_please/", "is_self": true}
