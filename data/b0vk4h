In the region I worked, they brought in someone to oversee the corridor and she's been making rules that are nigh impossible to follow while successfully doing your job. \n\nThey cut people left and right, and moved their jobs onto other unqualified employees.\n\nThey are making rules which are impossible to not break, for the express purpose of having an excuse to fire people.\n\nThey've cut maintenance staff across the board.\n\nTheir making rail crews build the trains instead of the switch crews.\n\nTheir bringing in inexperienced people, from the outside, for management positions.\n\nThere's a bit of an ongoing cat fight between UP and it's transport contractors over how long it should take to run a train, vs how long the van driver should be obligated to help.\n\nI've heard their new CEO, Lance Fritz, who is new, is being groomed for the Senate, with the ultimate goal of DOT, and plans to jump ship when possible.\n\nI've also heard that the uppers of the board are trying to artificially inflate the stock by cutting employees, not repairing, maintaining, or replacing equipment, (I've seen trains just outright explode while moving), firing staff willy-nilly, removing jobs for certain companies and even giving jobs to the BN --- they're inflating the stock to a certain point, then they're going to dump it and bounce while everyone else drowns.", "created_utc": 1552534877, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b0vk4h/watch_for_union_pacific_to_go_down_in_the_next/", "is_self": true}
