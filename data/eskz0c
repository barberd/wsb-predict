{"id": "eskz0c", "title": "Market maker virus", "selftext": "So this Chinese virus \ud83e\udda0 \n\nIt\u2019s not going to destroy the world, but it can bring about a simple flu or in bad cases pneumonia. Pneumonia is able to take the lives of already-very-vulnerable folks. In general that means the very old, immunocompromised, or those living live in true destitution (places where diarrhea carries a real risk of death). A few people have died so far, which is sad, but the garden variety get-your-flu-shot flu takes lives through pneumonia to. And for some reason we don\u2019t discuss that when we decide how to price AAPL before they announce earnings.\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly interesting though to consider why this particular scary flu virus might have such a significant impact on the market prices of securities. While I get that SARS was a thing 15 years ago (a weak argument that can nonetheless legitimize the fear), it appears to me what is really happening in the markets is a that the big players like to have a big multi-week \u201cfear\u201d button that they can push through the news. Iran faded surprisingly quickly, so within days they latched onto this next new fear, a bad flu virus outbreak. I guess that\u2019s the best they had. \n\nWhenever this Chinese flu news breaks, the big players can respond by short selling the indexes hard and get people to believe in the impact of flu news to cut prices. A few careful short sale injections and the algos have been trained and the cycle is self sustaining. The big players can then use their other strengths - get a touch ahead of the news releases - and use this exaggerated scare to push traders to panic sell whenever the news strikes just like Pavlov\u2019s dog salivated every time a bell rang.\n\nTLDR, right now this flu is just the latest tool to drive fear and max pain campaigns to flush out weak hands and take profits at their expense. \n\nWe presently have the strongest market in the world so foreign money is coming in, repo liquidity brings more money, yet bond yields suck, gold isn\u2019t cheap and safe stuff like utilities are way overpriced.\n\nCalls on the big indexes are on sale!", "created_utc": 1579739109, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eskz0c/market_maker_virus/", "is_self": true}
