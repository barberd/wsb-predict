{"id": "fpi5ye", "title": "WSB Championship Prize Money", "selftext": "First off: looks like Matt Levine picked up on the story and wants  to watch WSB the contestants blow out in 90 seconds: \n\n> Great! I will definitely watch this. I wish they were doing it now; that would be a challenge. I hope it is like one of those heavyweight championships that gets hyped up for months and then ends in a knockout in 90 seconds. They\u2019ll \u201cuse only stock options to trade\u201d! I hope they all lose all their money in the first five minutes and the person who goes like 4:58 is declared the winner.\n\n***\n\nAlso I want to address a question with regards to the prize money.  The prize will be big, as big as I am able to make it.  The truth is that if it weren\u2019t for coronavirus, then today we would be selling tickets to the event as part of this massive undertaking and I\u2019d have an exact number I could commit to.  That said, I\u2019m working hard and fast to overcome these unexpected challenges. I can tell you this: \n#**the prize will be between 6 and 7 figures.**\n\nOn that note, I want to take a moment to talk about our primary sponsor for the event [True Trading Group]( https://truetradinggroup.com/wallstreetbets/?cc=WSBTTG&cp=30) (TTG).  I\u2019ve always refrained from endorsing or allowing education sites, courses or books on WSB.  Mainly because there\u2019s so many out there that are just plain garbage.  That said I get tons of messages from you guys regularly asking me for resources of where to learn.  TTG is hands down, the absolute best research, education and trading interaction platform there is.  I\u2019ve vetted them and worked with them for quite some time, and I can tell you that they\u2019re good.  So much so, that even u/stormwillpass is part of their pro traders in charge of stock options.  I can\u2019t speak highly enough about them, so if you\u2019re interested in learning on a more serious level (more than the gambling you see on WSB) check them out.  They\u2019re offering a 30% **discount on all their services until March 31st** if you use discount code **WSBTTG**. If you decide to sign up afterwards, they will give a 20% discount with that same code.", "created_utc": 1585251807.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpi5ye/wsb_championship_prize_money/", "is_self": true}
