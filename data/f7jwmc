Gay AMD bears can suck my tits!", "selftext": "Fellow retards who bought AMD calls this week at the tip of the dick and got shafted like me, it's time to regroup and stop the gay bear momentum from the last two days.\n\nIntel Comet-Lake Prices Leaked, guess who is still faster AND more affordable? AMD bitches, yea.  \n[https://www.techradar.com/news/intel-comet-lake-s-prices-have-leaked-and-it-looks-like-amd-will-win-in-price-again](https://www.techradar.com/news/intel-comet-lake-s-prices-have-leaked-and-it-looks-like-amd-will-win-in-price-again) \n\nAMD Zen3 chips leaked; Starting to move at TSMC:  \n[https://www.pcgamesn.com/amd/zen-3-tsmc-chiplet-packaging](https://www.pcgamesn.com/amd/zen-3-tsmc-chiplet-packaging) \n\nWhy is this news important? \n\nBecause it means AMD is going to grow no matter what. Even if the market for semis stopped growing completely, AMD still has a path for growth by EATING INTO INTEL'S MARKET. GROWTH is what is gonna carry us into tendies, and AMD has alot of it in store this year. \n\nThe current Zen 2 architecture is handily DESTROYING Intel already. If you don't believe, go check out  /r/buildapc where AMD is literally at the center of every build. This change is also happening in massive billion dollar data centers. Imagine how dominant AMD will be with Zen 3 on the horizon? I REPEAT, AMD WILL KEEP GROWING EVEN IF THE MARKET DOESNT (At Intel's Expense).\n\nStop spreading your cheeks and instead spread the news.\n\nAMD to the moon, stay stronk.
