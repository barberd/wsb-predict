{"id": "gb5j52", "title": "Thanks WSB, but this is the end for my journey for now. I will see you again. (50k -> 45k -> 80k -> 65k)", "selftext": "[50k -\\> \\(10k\\) -\\> 45k -\\> 80k -\\> 65k](https://preview.redd.it/aeq3jshat0w41.png?width=1274&format=png&auto=webp&s=3193d5b28682cd5d5f2ed64c386d707f73b804e1)\n\nEntered the market on late January. Holding 260 shares of MSFT until I meet WSB you autists. During that time the market was not performing well and I lost around 5k. (50k -> 45k)\n\nYes I discovered WSB on March 13th, which made me immediately changed into \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b. I was dumb AF and yolo'ed all in SPY puts 03/16 (!) exp. I honestly did not understand what options are at all. Those options were bought right before Trump's pump, so my portfolio stay at 10k for the whole weekend, which freaked myself out. But extreme luck brought in the circuit breaker and I got a fat gainz of 30k. First one is free I guess? (45k -> 10k -> 80k)\n\nAfter that I started familiarized with the market, but I still have a lot to learn. In the next month or so, I generally bought puts and day trade only. I cashed out my starting 50k and had fun with my gainz. I was still somehow able to maintain my total portfolio value around 80k - 50k = 30k. My all time high was 32k, which is really not a lot of gainz after the first one.\n\nThis week is the most important week, since it is the tech earnings. I got AMD, APRN, MSFT, FB, AAPL, AMZN, all calls. Among those calls, FB I had least amount (oops), which was supposed to be the biggest winner of all. Everything else was either lost or theta ganged. Tomorrow will be a disaster, and it will trigger my max loss, so I will be outta here. Only able to secure 10k gainz in the past months, but I would rather **take that as half full than half empty**.\n\nBefore I go, I will YOLO everything else into SPY puts with a June exp date.\n\nNotable gains/losses:\n\n* 03/13 - 03/16 SPY puts (+30k)\n* 03/20 - 04/06 SPY puts (-7k)\n* 04/06 - 04/07 SPY calls (+12k)\n* 04/10 - ongoing PLAY $5 puts (-4.5k) super fat finger\n* 04/10 - 04/29 AMC $5 calls (+4k) penny calls\n* 04/27 - 04/28 AMD & APRN calls (-3k)\n* 04/29 - 04/30 SPY calls (-2k)\n* 04/30 - 05/01 AMZN & AAPL calls (-?k) disastrous\n\nStill holding:\n\n* ZNGA $8c 05/15 & $10c 06/19\n* CCJ $12c 06/19\n\nTomorrow:\n\n* SPY whatever puts\n\nHave to admit, I totally stressed myself out during the time trading. I have to wake up extra early since I live in the west coast. Not really worth it.\n\n**TL;DR**: Dumb af and yolo'ed SPY puts with 1 day exp on Trump pump day, fat gainz. Then lost half during tech earning week by bad luck. Cashed out, and yolo the rest into puts tomorrow.\n\n[See you again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgKAFK5djSk) soon.
