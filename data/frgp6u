Variation-separate is a speed demon at posting his thoughts\n\nThought I would provide an update for everyone on what has been happening with my play below.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fgm2ch/spy\\_to\\_220\\_by\\_march\\_20/?utm\\_source=share&amp;amp;utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fgm2ch/spy_to_220_by_march_20/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x)\n\nAfter the nice profit i flipped to vix puts (as my posts indicated), then sold them all March 24th for about 300%. Didn't post cause i thought i would compile it with what happens on this next part of my play. I sold them all on that morning but i also loaded up on VIX calls again. Premium went sky high minutes later so the timing couldnt have been better. Have basically been holding 150% profit throughout the whole rally so im not complaining lol. I am expecting somewhere around 100 for VIX when we peak. (and yes we haven't peaked yet as i indicated to numerous people on various posts).\n\nSo i was going to have this really nice explanation with all my thoughts posted and some nice humor and beautiful crayon TA charts (even bought a new crayola set just for this moment) etc. But this other analyst bastard keeps posting ahead of me. SO I'm just gonna reference him here and his post and basically say he has my blessing. Just close your eyes and pretend im saying the same shit.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frcuzr/order\\_66\\_the\\_revenge\\_of\\_the\\_bears/?utm\\_source=share&amp;amp;utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frcuzr/order_66_the_revenge_of_the_bears/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x)\n\nPrice action right not looks like a gap fill. Oil looks weak. Equities will follow commodities as he discussed. After the gap is filled tho...... not promising. \n\nHere is a gap fill look. I would be surprised if we wake up to see it went above 2520.\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/x/ltbGBNAA/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ltbGBNAA/)\n\nYea... basically it. u/Variation-Separate is taking my thunder. All jokes aside you do good work. Happy to be on the same side with you. But i don't mind the friendly rivalry should our opinions ever change ;)\n\nSPOILER: Apparently there is a rumor going around that i am a girl. Maybe people fantasizing about blowies or something. Anyway sorry to disappoint i am a dude. However i am a gay bear so the blowies are still on the table.... ;)\n\nAs always do your own research and DD. This is in no way advocating for anyone to take any positions.\n\nGL", "created_utc": 1585528080.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frgp6u/bloody_monday_vix_calls_copy_pasta_and_spoiler/", "is_self": true}
