{"id": "f3ll2c", "title": "MSFT LEAPS are the way", "selftext": "Okay, so I saw someone say that they can turn 25k into 1M with 03/19/2021 260c. Idk what they're on, but it got me thinking about how much you could actually make.\n\nPast 5 years, MSFT is up 334.97% or an average of 66.994% per year. Say MSFT continues on this path and reaches $306.81 (183.73\\*1.66994). A 03/19/2021 280c is $1.58 right now so if MSFT does hit our projection of above $300, we'll be $20 ITM. A call expiring 1 week from today and $20 ITM is worth $21.33. So, hypothetically, if MSFT continues on the route it's been taking for the past 5 years, you could see 1350% gains in the next year.\n\nThank you for coming to my TED Talk, and remember kids, stonks only go up.", "created_utc": 1581648300, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3ll2c/msft_leaps_are_the_way/", "is_self": true}
