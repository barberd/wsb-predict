In these artistic work of fictions, I pretended that my goal was to see if it is possible for a collective of autists such as r/WSB to use the integrated leverage of:\n\n- Call contracts 100:1 ratios\n- Institutions algorithms risk hedging strategies.\n- Social Media\n- W E A P O N I S E D.  A U T I S M.\n\nAnd combine it into a Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC) conflagration with enough power to actually inflate a $1.5Trillion Market Cap stock ($MSFT), at open, on 05.02.2020. \n\n*Only a fool would believe that such things are possible.*\n\nFor those of you who missed my artistic work of autistic fiction: \nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eyvcqy/lol_bloomberg_admitting_that_as_long_as_we_buy/\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eyztcx/bloomberg_confirmed_how_to_rig_market_buy_msft/\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ez7a6k/here_we_go_were_memeing_msft_into_orbit_ladies/\n\n**RESULTS**\n\n**Anyway, long story short, [this is what happened yesterday to $MSFT at Open.](https://imgur.com/HbCL15y) with NASDAQ publishing a featured article about how \"[Microsoft Corporation (Symbol: MSFT) saw options trading volume of 490,594 contracts, representing approximately 49.1 million underlying shares or approximately 175.1% of MSFT's average daily trading volume over the past month](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/notable-wednesday-option-activity%3A-ibm-msft-gild-2020-02-05)\"** \n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nMake your own conclusions.\n\n*Mendatory Disclaimer for SEC : The stories and information posted here are artistic works of fiction and falsehood.
