Vicromax which has shown 98% elimination rate of COVID-19 in Trials. FDA apparel slated for 5/15/20. These Industry vets don\u2019t choose losers. Plans already in motion to spin up a public offering for their COVID-19 Treatment company Vicromax.\n\nBioSig bought an antiviral which has shown great promise. Their study was just published in [medical journal](https://f1000research.com/articles/9-361). They submitted to be [approved for FDA Phase 2](https://www.biosig.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/188/mayo-clinic-preparing-to-commence-phase-ii-fda-clinical) Trials on April 16th. The FDA has 30 days to object or they are automatically approved to continue.\n\nOnce an IND is submitted, the FDA has 30 days to object to the IND or it automatically becomes effective and clinical trials may begin. If the FDA detects a problem, it may place a clinical hold on the IND, prohibiting the start of the clinical studies until the problem is resolved.\n\n**THE TEAM.**\n\no **Biotech Hall of Famer Dennis Purcell Founder of Aisling Capital** & JPM Healthcare Conf in SF (when he was at H&Q) Joins Yucaipa's Quintero ($35 Bill in M&A) & Sam Navarro (40 huge healthcare deals) for VCLR exit strategies/monetization\n\no **CEO Mayo Clinic**\n\no **Chairman Mayo Clinic COVID Task force** (expert in virus-host interactions chose Vicromax out of 70 apps to Mayo to bePrincipal Investigator)\n\no **Ex head of $180 billion Merck** Vaccines responsible 1 of the biggest vaccine blockbusters in history Gardasil 4 HPV\n\no **Ex-Celgene CMO responsible for number 1 cancer drug ever & IND & early trial designs for $12 bill Otezla just sold to AMGN**\n\no **Vice-Chairman NASDAQ**\n\no **Ex Wilmington Trust Chairman of Board**\n\no **PWC Life Sciences CEO of Year & E&Y Entrepreneur of Year**\n\no **Head of Morgan Stanley M&A dept & founder MS biotech practice Michael Schmertzler**\n\no **AZN EVP Global Commercial** **Ops**=>**commercialized 10 blockbuster brands**, each $1 bill in sales\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTIMELINE - The Past Month Since they submitted to FDA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*April 21, 2020*\n\n**Anthony (\u2018Tony\u2019) Zook**\n\n[**\\[LinkedIn\\]**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tony-zook-10421566/)\n\nPR: \u201cBrings to ViralClear a wealth of\u00a0**commercialization experience in the pharmaceutical industry\u201d**\n\n**AstraZeneca**\n\n\u00b7\u00a0Executive Vice President of\u00a0**Global Commercial Operations**\u00a0from 2010 to 2013\n\n\u00b7\u00a0President and CEO of the North American division from 2007 to 2010\n\n\u00b7\u00a0President of Medimmune, the wholly owned biologics division of AstraZeneca, from 2008 to 2010\n\n\u00b7\u00a0Under Mr. Zook\u2019s leadership,\u00a0**AstraZeneca commercialized ten blockbuster brands, each in excess of $1 billion in sales**.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0Along with the CEO, CFO, and Head of R&D, Mr. Zook sat on the Portfolio Investment Board (PIB), which\u00a0**set and approved the overall strategy for Research and Development and allocated resources by therapeutic area**.\n\n**Served or Continues on Other Boards**\n\n\u00b7\u00a0AltheRx,\n\n\u00b7\u00a0Inhibikase,\n\n\u00b7\u00a0Rib-X Pharmaceuticals,\n\n\u00b7\u00a0National Pharmaceutical Council\n\n\u00b7\u00a0PhRMA\n\n\u00b7\u00a0Pennsylvania Division of the American Cancer Society\n\n\u00b7\u00a0Frostburg State University (alma mater)\n\n**Tony Zook**: \u201cI have been very impressed with what the ViralClear team achieved in just one month.
