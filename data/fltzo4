Dentists have all been lock-downed in Europe and US. (70% of revenues). Nobody is going to be buying dental consumables or new dental equipment.\n2. Even if dentists were to resume operations in July, consumer confidence will be quite badly affected. How many consumers are going to purchase $8k braces in a recession?\n3. Yes, stock has gone down 60%. However, there is **high risk of bankruptcy.**\n\n* Envista was spun out of Danaher in Sept 2019. Before spinning Envista out, parent company loaded it with a shit ton of debt ($1.3 billion).\n* Envista has only $20m of cash in US. There is $200m of cash on balance sheet, however, $180m is held in foreign countries such as China, with heavy withdrawal restrictions.\n* The $1.3b of debt has very strict covenants including a Debt to EBITDA of 3.75 to 1. Failing which, the whole amount of $1.3b immediately comes due. Currently their Debt to EBITDA is 3.1 ($1.3b of debt; last 4 quarters EBITDA up to Dec 2019 of $420.7m). **With just 1 loss-making quarter,** likely 2020 Q2, their DEBT to EBITDA will spiral to 4 or more, triggering **$1.3b of debt due immediately**. At that point, no bank in their right mind will loan $1.3b to a company in such bad situation.\n\nSources:\n\n1. 2019 Q4 results: [http://investors.envistaco.com/image/Q4+Envista+Earnings+Presentation\\_FINAL.pdf](http://investors.envistaco.com/image/Q4+Envista+Earnings+Presentation_FINAL.pdf)\n2.

Also, if you don't think you can get in/out of the options, you can\n\n**a) do a straight short.** That works too.\n\nb) hold to expiry for the June contracts\n\n**Edit 2: There are options for sale YO. Just bid around the midpoint.**\n\n[Options available](https://preview.redd.it/ao5impk31un41.jpg?width=1541&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4dcc84ed882b6fe2fd9aa450458c6b6ddfe80846)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1584706289.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fltzo4/put_on_nvst_envista_jun_9_strike/", "is_self": true}
