In my opinion it looks like FNKO tried to expand their product mix a little too fast.\n\n- Despite the Baby Yoda POP! being the top selling toy on Amazon this Christmas, clearly some of their other licensing agreements aren\u2019t pulling their weight. They should probably re-evaluate scaling down their already massive licensing portfolio cause royalties are bitch.\n\n- finally, 1.661 adjusted beta. is that really where you want to be when the shit hits the fan?\n\nclearly the downgrade is what started the sell-off and the algos kicking in exacerbated it. \n\nif anyone can give me a reason to not slit my wrists right now i\u2019m all ears.", "created_utc": 1581010648, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ezvsd7/fnko_discussion/", "is_self": true}
