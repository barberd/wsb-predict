Seroprevalence estimates ranged from 0.1% to 47%. Infection fatality rates ranged from 0.02% to 0.86% (median 0.26%) and corrected values ranged from 0.02% to 0.78% (median 0.25%). Among people <70 years old, infection fatality rates ranged from 0.00% to 0.26% with median of 0.05% (corrected, 0.00-0.23% with median of 0.04%).\u201d\n\nUS COVID-19 Facts:\n\n- Median infection fatality rate: 0.04%\n- The study does not model social distancing solely infection rate and associated deaths\n- 80% of US Covid deaths are those over 65\n- Average US Covid death age 78\n- 60% of Covid deaths were due to pneumonia\n- Only 9% of covid deaths were without comorbidities (diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, cancer)\n- Among the most vulnerable population that are 75 or older covid accounts for 9% of these deaths year-to-date\n\nTL;DR among all age groups (outliers being 75+ and skewing the CFR higher) the same chances to die from salmonella or ecoli (0.03-0.05) half the chance to die from adult chicken pox (0.02), and a quarter of the chance to die from the flu (0.01)\n\nWhy it doesn\u2019t matter and next week is likely red:\n\n- We\u2019re reporting cases and not focusing on deaths for a reason = if it bleeds it reads.\n\n- In 2008, the American people and the Republican Party were morally against bailouts - now we turned that printer on full blast and injecting trillions into companies and an easily $350B into the hands of Main Street.\n\n- It\u2019s an election year.\n\n- No one reads or otherwise cares\n\n- We\u2019ve collectively decided it\u2019s okay to sacrifice the financial future of younger generations and completely fuck over those in or close to retirement to extend the life of of the most vulnerable even though they are above or close to the average life expectancy in this country (78).", "created_utc": 1593218540.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hgjrl7/why_i_am_a_gay_bull/", "is_self": true}
