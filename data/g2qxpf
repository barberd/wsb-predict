{"id": "g2qxpf", "title": "They Bamboozled Us!", "selftext": "So today was the most BORING day in the market so far. Nothing happened except airlines, cruises, and SPCE fell. Then suddenly, deep in the underworld of the stock market, an announcement is made that retail investors can\u2019t get in on. COVID IS CURED! That\u2019s right. Totally cured! The economy will be reopened by noon tomorrow. \n\nI find it odd that this news broke immediately after the markets closed. Add to this, Trump is going to address the nation tonight about reopening the economy. This is too much good news all at once and it seems like it was deliberately withheld from us to make Friday the brightest green day we\u2019ve seen in a while. \n\nBut is this the last gasp of the bull trap before it rolls over and dies? Or will this continue into the future leaving all the bears in the dust?", "created_utc": 1587081800.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2qxpf/they_bamboozled_us/", "is_self": true}
