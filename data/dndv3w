I incorrectly thought that that would be my max loss.\n\nWrong, ended up losing ~$6,500.\n\nBasically, MSFT ended the regular trading hour below the right wing at $142, but above the body at $140, thus I ended up holding 2,000 shares of MSFT short after the JEDI news hit the wire and sent the stock to $145, incurring a paper loss of (145-142)*2000+500=$6,500.\n\nOne expensive lesson, that in some peculiar cases, butterfly has unlimited max loss way beyond the premium paid.", "created_utc": 1572096520, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dndv3w/til_max_loss_for_a_butterfly_option_strategy_can/", "is_self": true}
