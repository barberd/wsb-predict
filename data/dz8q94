Right now I\u2019m considering 1 contract AMD call for 11/29 just to see what it\u2019s like. It\u2019s only $37 if it goes south but potential $3k gain if It hits $43. Of which I can waste away on other stupid life choices. \nIf I do buy the contract, do I sit on it until the 29th? I don\u2019t get what you\u2019re suppose to do with them.", "created_utc": 1574286098, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dz8q94/amd_call_1129/", "is_self": true}
