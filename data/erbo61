I would much rather YOLO my earnings and get tendies, so therefore I'm currently investigating my OPTIONS.   \n\n\nI had a question about how to handle the unlikely event of standing with a profitable ITM option close to close-date.\n\nIf I buy a call on an option OTM, and it is ITM near the exercise-date, from what I can understand i then have 3 options, to let it expire, to exercise it (and buy the amount of stock that I optioned the right to buy) or to somehow sell the option to someone else.   \n\n\nMy question is, how do I sell this option to someone else instead of having to post capital to buy all of the stock?  \nIs it just like writing an option?
