So Im gonna tell you right now: $ROPE. That's right, you are most likely fucked. Most likely.\n\nSo as some of you noticed today as soon as SPY went above 7%, IV skyrocketed.  My put at 238 was hard carried by IV until freaking 242. So what does this mean? \n\nIt means your ass will be saved if you bought at the right time.
