I started playing video games till 5am and sleeping in till 4pm and I had suicidal thoughts every day. However, ever since I started my new 6 figure job in January and finally got some money to invest, Wall Street Bets has helped me cure my depression. I'm always focused on which stocks will do well and which stocks won't, which takes my mind off thinking about everything that's wrong with my life. For the first time in months, I'm actually excited to wake up early before 6 to look at the stock market and read DDs on WSB. Whether I lose or gain money, I'm happier than before cus I don't think about my tragedies anymore. On top of all this, WSB humor actually makes me laugh and I feel less lonely by participating in the daily and weekend discussion threads. Thank you so much everyone!! May you enjoy lots of tendies!\n\nTLDR: WSB cured my depression, got me excited to wake up early.\n\nPuts on Cruise lines, amusement parks, event companies, casinos, airlines, travel agencies. 20% OTM puts, 2-4 months out.\n\nCalls on medical companies and WIFI. 20% OTM, 3-6 months out.", "created_utc": 1583634462.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ff5ydb/thanks_wsb_for_helping_me_deal_with_my_depression/", "is_self": true}
