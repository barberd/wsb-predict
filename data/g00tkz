I made a post 3 weeks ago regarding how to avoid IV crush during this recent market rally. The link to that can be found here: [Don't Scream \"GUH\", Avoid IV Crush](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmshcv/when_market_bounce_inevitably_comesdont_scream/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x). That trade worked out well, and I am back. \n\nToday, I am back with a follow-up for navigating the road ahead. **This post is not about** ***why*** **the market will potentially retest the lows, but rather** ***how*** **to maximize profit and limit downside risk should the move down occur.** Just as the vega-neutral post focused on volatility trades, this one explores vol strategies further. I tried to substitute words with pictures for the illiterate inclined. \n\nFor solid DD on where the market is going, view u/Variation-Separate or u/scarvesandsuspenders recent posts. I do believe that sitting at either the 50% or potential near term 61.8% retracement will trigger the next leg down, and this post is about how to capitalize on that through volatility. \n\n**At best, you will get a trade idea (other than $SPY puts / $SPY straddles). At worst, you will gain some solid understanding of volatility and how it applies to you. My goal in this post is to take a pretty abstract concept and break it down so that we can all become more profitable.** Take 5 minutes, read, challenge my strategy, ask questions, and achieve nirvana. Let's begin. \n\n**So You Say I Should Trade Volatility, Aye:**\n\nYes. That is exactly what I am saying. While retail traders and WSBers have been yoloing FD on TSLA and SPCE (Jan 2022 calls will print), smart money has been executing the best trade of the past decade. The trade: **Short volatility, hedged with volatility insurance.** This is done by shorting $VXX (short vol), and purchasing $VIX calls (long vol) on a rolling basis as a hedge. Depending on the time frame of your $VIX calls (weekly, quarterly, monthly), this trade has performed dramatically well. \n\nThe strategy is rooted in the belief that volatility will, over time, mean revert and decrease after spikes caused by a \"black swan.\" It is logical - option premiums on the S&P 500 (for which the $VIX tracks) theoretically will never remain permanently inflated as news becomes digested. Take a look at 2008, 2000, etc - the common theme is volatility starts to **slowly** recede before the lows of the S&P 500 are registered as the catalyst causes an explosion of volatility, and as the market prices in the \"black swan,\" the market naturally performs price discovery causing volatility to come down. That is not to say volatility does not continue to spike during draw-downs in equities - it does, but typically not as dramatically unless the incoming news is categorized as dramatically more significant.\n\n* u/stonksgodown made a post regarding this phenomenon, but omitted some key factors and made some bold assumptions that I wanted to counter / elaborate on.\n\n**Realized Volatility verse Implied Volatility:**\n\nImplied volatility for the broader market can be understood through $VIX. IV is forward looking, and gives us an understanding of how much the market is expecting to move over the next 30-day period (this is a simplification, but applies). Realized volatility is actual variance in price movement over a period in time. To compare the two, solve for the realized volatility over the past 30 day period (21 trading days) by taking the standard deviation, adjusted for an annualized reading. I calculated this to get updated data, and the current output is below:\n\n[RV \\/ IV 2020](https://preview.redd.it/35274i2e4as41.png?width=483&format=png&auto=webp&s=373e3068f8df94f6e4b65be3a692bd5e1c02e40a)\n\nWhat we can see is that a pretty stark divergence has occurred, with realized vol moving higher than implied vol. This negative spread relationship is counter-intuitive. Think about it. **If IV is forward looking, it should be trading at a premium to where RV is currently trading at because we need to account for the uncertainty in the future variance of the markets.** \n\nThis is not the first time this has happened. It occurred in 2002, in 2008, and in a few periods of high volatility since the GFC. \n\n[RV \\/ IV 2008](https://preview.redd.it/ujrsn6wh4as41.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3692b766c961835a5f85953643181f87d8907ae)\n\n[RV \\/ IV Collection](https://preview.redd.it/lfgm3wfj4as41.png?width=669&format=png&auto=webp&s=316882d12d5ddaebf7eb0a59480e648999aec947)\n\nThe important theme is that, over time, the relationship eventually returns to normalcy. That is, overtime either realized vol decreases, implied vol increases, or a combination of the two occurs. This is where our previous author went astray by saying this divergence requires a spike in IV - there are many ways for this imbalance to revert to normalcy. \n\nWhen RV is below IV, the market is understating the risk of a large loss. When RV is above IV, the market is clearly in distress, and it is overstating the risk of a large loss. **Put simply: RV > IV, the market favors option buyers, RV < IV, the market favors option sellers.** \n\nThis is huge, because it clearly articulates the opportunity cost of purchasing verse selling options. But as I highlighted before, the return to a positive IV / RV spread can occur with a decrease in RV, an increase in IV, or a combination of the two, and the time frame is murky. So, Master Skywalker, what are we going to do?\n\nLet's take a look at the $VIX futures because they can show us what the market is forecasting for expected future movement of $SPX option implied volatility. The term structure for the $VIX futures is showing mad backwardation - that is, the future settlement dates are trading well below the current spot price. In WSB terms, the futures market is implying $VIX will continue to fall over the next 8 months.\n\n[$VIX Futures Term Structure](https://preview.redd.it/1xbj1x1m6as41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcb4ea8ff11c7221b9166885571b1c5f112ee503)\n\n**The Volatility Trade, Applied Right Now:**\n\nWe are presented with 3 potential outcomes:\n\n* Realized Vol Decreases (requires $VIX to decrease or trade narrowly)\n* Implied Vol Increases\n* A combination of the two over time (most likely outcome)\n\nThe issue is - Realized Vol has already happened, so how do we speculate on this? By using a similar concept to a reverse calendar spread. **The trade:** \n\nShort $VIX Futures with Settlement for Sept 2020 ($VXU20) - **Bet that RV Decreases Over 5 Month Period**\n\n* Or just short $VXX\n\nLong $VIX calls: $VIX call, 45 strike, $3.90 ask, expiring 6/17/20 - **Bet that IV Increases Over 2 Month Period**\n\nNote: I recognize that most of you do not have access to futures or even shorting for that matter, which is why I will also present a solid hybrid trade, but hear me out.\n\nWhat this does: $VIX futures with further settlement dates, while less liquid, are less sensitive to short-term spikes in the $VIX. This trade is a bet that implied volatility through September will be decreasing in aggregate. The $VIX calls with short-term settlement dates are implemented to hedge my short $VIX futures, and capitalize on any potential increase in IV moving forward should we retest the lows in $SPY. **This trade let's me bet on a short-term decrease in $SPY (and related spike in $VIX), while hedging with a longer-term bet that volatility will decrease.** It is essentially a volatility strangle with different time frames. This requires margin, and excess cash in case of margin call :)\n\n**How a Newb With a Robinhood Account Can Do This:**\n\nThe simple newb approach would be a reverse calendar spread (sell long dated calls, buy short-date calls) on $VXX, but that caps our gains, and we are not here for capped gains. If you are, jump over to r/investing.\n\nI recognize that RH does not allow $VIX, let alone $VIX futures. So let's reassess the goal of this trade: We expect $SPY to retest the lows, volatility to spike in the short-term, and I want tendies to print because of this. This movement should work toward restoring a positive relationship between RV and IV. But, maybe you, like me, have cautious conviction about this trade given the Fed, US Gov stimulus, and other erroneous factors. So, with the goal of maximizing gains, and limiting losses, we are going to hedge our exposure.\n\n**The Hypothetical Hedged Vol Trade:**\n\n* Long $SVXY (inverse volatility ETP) - inverse vol AKA $VIX go down, profit go up - **Short Vol Leg**\n* Long $VXX calls, $VIX calls , or even $SVXY puts if you really wanted to - **Long Vol Leg**\n   * Can adjust the weightings to amplify exposure to short-term volatility, i.e. for every 100 shares of $SVXY on the short vol leg, purchase 2 option contracts on the long vol leg. Find a combination that satisfies your risk tolerance. Note: $SVXY tracks -0.5x the performance of short-term $VIX futures ($SPVXSP). \n* You can also just do volatility straddles / strangles, but the issue is decreasing vol tends to move very slowly, which is why avoiding theta option decay on the short vol leg is very important.\n* **Hedging is for Pussies!** If this is you - fear not, you have some options, but if you're wrong, it is really gonna hurt. \n* $SVXY Puts\n* $VXX Calls / $VIX Calls\n* $SPY Puts\n* $SPY straddle / strangle - risk IV crush, narrow trading range, theta decay etc. \n* **Note: These are just trade strategies. These are not recommendations, and many combinations of the aforementioned products can be utilized, but be sure to understand what you are investing in.** \n\nIn this scenario, we are going long $SVXY (short vol) to capture the pullback in RV overtime, and we are long $VXX calls to capture the short-term increase in IV, and to hedge our short vol exposure. **What you just did is capture really good upside opportunity while hedging away downside risk, and eliminate the chance of blowing up your account.** The reason we are hedging our long vol is because the RV / IV relationship is imbalanced, but that does not mean we are guaranteed higher IV in the short-term.\n\n**tl;dr - I expect the market to move in the direction of retesting the lows, but Fed bailout, Fiscal stimulus, and overall complacency could prevent a retest. Thus, instead of trading $SPY, consider trading volatility as the relationship between realized vol and implied vol is fucked up, and will correct itself over time. Because of this, explore going short volatility while hedging with long volatility call options. Long $SVXY, Long $VXX Calls.**\n\nAs always, discuss, challenge, ask questions and shitpost!\n\n- \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc36", "created_utc": 1586712306.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g00tkz/when_market_crash_inevitably_comesdont_scream_guh/", "is_self": true}
