Is it Funko 2.0?\n\nIt's very odd because Zoom did get a hit due to recent news this week but didn't really drop enough to stay down and has been rsing up gradually again. But there's a chance it'll end up back at it's original shareprice range or lower if its competitors manage to convince people to Switch, and Zoom fails to deal with pissed off customers that don't care for it's many issues.\n\nWith this inconsistent market it's hard to see where it will go. You also have the issue of whether Dr.Jerome will use his frankenstein money machine to help prop up the stock, or if not him the chinese government.", "created_utc": 1588359453.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gbo1s4/do_you_believe_zoom_has_a_future_or_is_it_a_fad/", "is_self": true}
