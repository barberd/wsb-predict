{"id": "g646uk", "title": "$SHOP til we drop", "selftext": "I\u2019m keeping this simple, because like you, I too, am retarded.  There are no technicals here, just a cold, hard, wall of text. \n\nEveryone and their cousin have been rushing to stick their dick in $AMZN these past few weeks. And yeah, she\u2019s a sloppy bitch, but there\u2019s only so much pump one girl can take. So, where can you turn if you don\u2019t want some boonhickles sloppy seconds? The answer is simple, $SHOP.\n\n\u2018But Steve, isn\u2019t Shopify hovering close to all-time highs?\u2019 Why yes, yes it is Nancy Drew. Do you know why it has been soaring? Of course you don\u2019t, but I\u2019m going to tell you. And then I\u2019m going to tell you why it\u2019s going to go higher.\n\n# The Past\n\nHop in my time machreeee and travel with me back in time. The year, 2019. For his podcast \u2018How I Built This\u2019, Guy Raz is interviewing Shopify CEO Tobias L\u00fctke and they are talking about the 2008 crash. Shopify had been expecting to shutter operations amidst unprecedented economic fallout and dire unemployment numbers, but instead, they found that the surge in unemployment led to people using the extra time on their hands to scratch their entrepreneurial itch. Shopify, in turn, saw record growth.\n\n# The Present\n\nCut to today, we are looking down the barrel of 22 million unemployment claims over just the past 4 weeks\u2026 and it\u2019s going to get worse. What\u2019s coming is an unprecedented spike of unemployed folks looking to embrace their inner Rockefeller. But it\u2019s not just them \u2014 it\u2019s Farmer\u2019s Market vendors, traditional B2B businesses, Brick and Mortar retailers, people who are actually creative, and yes, retards like you and me who have turned to a life of drop-shipping N95 masks and toilet paper from that one Chinese company who until last month exclusively manufactured fidget spinners \u2014 we\u2019re all looking for avenue\u2019s to keep the monopoly money flowing. \n\nHeinz \u2014 you know, the guys who make the ketchup you fucking nerds put on your scrambled eggs \u2014 have been a B2B company since they were founded in 1869. No longer. As of last week, they are selling Direct to Consumer\u2026 [using Shopify](https://heinztohome.co.uk/). And any company not run by out-of-touch boomers is following suit.\n\nTotal retail sales in the US \u2014 5.46 Trillion in 2019.  That\u2019s a lot of scharole.  And unlike 2008, Shopify now exists all over the fucking world. Their international growth potential is astounding, especially considering that as recently as 2018 the platform was only available in English and a mere 23% of their revenue was outside of Canaduh and The United States of Freedomtown.  Shopify is now in 175 different countries. 1-7-5 \u2014 those are nearly coronavirus numbers! This past Thursday, Shopify\u2019s CTO stated that they are [seeing \u2018Black Friday level traffic everyday\u2019](https://twitter.com/jmwind/status/1250816681024331777). \n\nThey clear a monthly fee for each storefront, they are pulling down payment processing fees, fulfillment fees, and then they have their competitive moat\u2026 an entire app ecosystem so that you can pimp out your storefront like Xzibit. These guys could give jpow\u2019s printer a run for its money.  JK \u2014 not, fucking, possible. \n\n# The Competition\n\n**[Etsy](https://www.etsy.com):** Whereas Shopify offers a dynamic eCommerce platform, Etsy caters to handmade and artisanal products, and takes a cut of product sales and charges to list products.  They\u2019re like Shopify\u2019s free-spirited, crystal-infused, nudist younger brother. Shopify stands to capture much more market share due to the disruption of traditional retail, but Etsy should still see some growth as the creatives go to the platform to subsidize their Trump bucks.  If $SHOP is too rich for your blood, I think $ETSY, currently 15% off their 52-week high, also has positive prospects. That said, they come with a MUCH lower ceiling. \n\n**[Magento](https://magento.com/):** Adobe bought Shopify\u2019s largest competitor, Magento, in 2018. It\u2019s more flexible than Shopify, BUT it caters towards larger stores, is self-hosted, and requires a lot more upfront effort to get up and running. Because of the higher barrier to entry, and the fact that people are lazy bastards, I believe Shopify will capture the vast majority of new eCommerce adopters.\n\n**[Square](https://squareup.com/us/en):** Square\u2019s bread and butter are brick and mortar retailers. They thrive on storefront business.  In 2018 they acquired Weebly, signaling a break into the eCommerce space. And then, in 2019, they introduced their online store-front alternative, \u2018Square Online Store\u2019. While they get a 0 on the innovative name game, I do think they will capture a chunk of brick and mortar retailers who already use their service for in-person purchases, but their solution appears to be much less dynamic than Shopify\u2019s offering. I think they are overexposed to the traditional retail pullback, though their eCommerce solution should ensure they won\u2019t go down as hard as your mom did last weekend.\n\n**[Market Fundamentals](https://www.federalreserve.gov/):** General consensus around here is that this recovery defies reason and I tend to agree. You don\u2019t lose a quarters-worth of production, growth, and sales and keep on chugging along as if nothing happened. Eventually, the recovery gravy train we\u2019ve witnessed these last few weeks could come tumbling down. It\u2019s important to keep this ever-present risk in mind. Plus, now that a Mad Max future is out the window with unlimited cheap oil, who knows what nightmarish future we are marching into.\n\n# The Future\nWith a barrier to entry of just $29 bucks a month and easy, code-free setup, Shopify is the no-brainer platform of choice for aspiring robber barons in the impending post-apocalyptic dystopia that awaits us all. Yes, Shopify\u2019s P/E ratio is pretty fucking absurd. But you know what? When Amazon was preparing for world domination, it was expensive too, and now it\u2019s a motherfuckin meme stock with a 1.2 trillion dollar market cap.  Shopify may be caressing all-time highs, but they\u2019ve been at or near \u2018all-time highs\u2019 at pretty much any given date going back the past 4 years. Shopify has no debt and 2.4 billion in cash stuffed into their mattresses. It goes without saying that they are prepared for those depression era bread lines. Earnings are 5/06. People are stuck at home, bored as fuck or dying of the \u2018rona, what else are they doing if not buying dumb shit online. At the very least we\u2019re going to be seeing a massive spike in subscriptions as well as a host of big-name brands transitioning to the platform. \n\nWe are seeing a monumental shift not just in retail, but in how we fundamentally live. I believe Shopify is positioned for this long term. With a market cap of $70 billion, I\u2019m bullish on Shopify\u2019s prospects over the next few years thanks to the extraordinary circumstances and extraordinary times we are living in. I also suspect that we will see a further spike in the short term, as people come to terms with the pivotal role Shopify is going to be playing in the future of eCommerce. \n\nSo what do you do with this information?\n\nThe answer is simple\u2026 open your own Shopify store and start selling Depends.\n\n\n**All information in this post is personal opinion and not direct financial advice.
