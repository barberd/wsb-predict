I come to you on bended knee asking for your glorious guidance. Just to let you know what kind of ignorance you're dealing with first and what I'm actually familiar with, here's a list of vocabulary according to this newb \nYield curve: Something to do with expected returns over time maybe? Or is it the curve you have to make with your car on a round-about with a yield sign?\nBull: That animal John Cena did a voice over for in that one movie. Ferdinand maybe?\nBear: A gay man who is chubby/fat and also hairy. Secondary definition: DITKA!\nPut: As in put me down for that time share man, I know an opportunity when I see one. \nCall: Nobody uses phones to call anymore, this should be text right?\nGreeks: Can't say I really trust them. All the fraternities from *my* college had some sketchy guys in them. \nThe fed: You means feds? As in the guys who knock on my door when they find out my boy Elon committed securities fraud by following my advice? \nMy question is this: Should I buy Disney calls that expire after November 12th since that's when Disney plus launches? Joe Kreuger told me it was a good idea. He's Jim Kramer's imaginary friend who starred in a TV show about nothing. \nHELP ME AUTISTS!!!!", "created_utc": 1571257584, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/div7pe/first_yolo_questions_need_help_from_the_wsb_elites/", "is_self": true}
