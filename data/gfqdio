If someone is blocked from cancelling positions they made that day, is that hurting them? i.e. If I want to take a profit on that day from a position I just opened, I can't because I'm blocked. If I misread a chart and buy in at the top I can't close my position and get out of the loss.\n\nLosing out on profits hurts just as much as taking a loss.
