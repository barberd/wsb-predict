{"id": "fiqr2v", "title": "AMT - American Tower Corporation - Overvalued & Heavily Levered", "selftext": "AMT is a REIT that operates wireless and broadcast communications real estate, including wireless towers and distributed antenna systems. It is one of the leading owners and operators of telecommunication towers in the U.S., India, Africa and Latin America. One interesting fact is the bulk of its towers are located overseas, but the company still generates the majority of its revenues in the U.S.\n\nOver the past few years, this stock's growth has greatly benefitted from the rise in spending on the wireless carrier infrastructure. As companies invested in more leases for towers this REIT stock's price boomed into a bubble. Going forward though, the outlook is super grim now that COVID-19 is taking widespread effect in the USA which AMT heavily relies upon.\n\nMany analysts have lowered or cut their outlook and shifted towards a HOLD or sell rating.\n\nWhen it comes to insider transactions there's nothing but steady dumping for the past few months. Their EVP & President, multiple directors, SVP of Finance, EVP Chief Admin & more have steadily sold millions in shares since Oct.\n\nInvestment Thesis:\n\nAMT operates within the tower business. This tower business is very capital intensive, and returns are typically not good unless or until the tower provider can secure multiple tenants on the tower, a feat made more difficult for a competitor by the limited pool of potential customers. In the U.S., for example, the big four wireless service providers generally make up about 90% of the segment's revenue.\n\nWith COVID-19, global supply chains have been disrupted and people have been quick to discount the value of companies affected such as Apple, Microsoft, and the like of many tech companies are down at least 20%+. However, the long ripple effect that will be displayed has yet to be fully priced in when companies cut their spending levels.\n\nFor example, many wireless carriers are being forced to push back on 5G expansion plans. Earlier this month, Mobile World Congress 2020 was canceled \u2014 a tradeshow where new smartphones are introduced and where deal-making goes on. This is problematic when AMT earns only a 3% return per tower when there is only one tenant.\n\nThe International Data Corporation (\u201cIDC\u201d) updated its projections on IT spending showing growth dropping rapidly. Basically, this market research firm expects corporates to further reduce or postpone their non-essential technology investment plans.\n\nThe Sprint & TMobile merger creates another reason for there to be reduced demand for wireless towers, as Consolidation from four to three major U.S. carriers, and further consolidation internationally will reduce tower revenue as carriers eliminate redundant networks.\n\nOverall, it is clear that these carriers begin to cut back on spending and less aggressive efforts to grow internationally. It will dramatically hurt the cash flows AMT is receiving.\n\nLastly, there is a long-term risk since American Tower perpetually controls only 31% of its U.S. land, leaving it largely subject to landlords and leases. Since American Tower owns its towers, changes in land control could be complicated and costly.\n\nWe can already see the stock is nearing financial distress levels. When looking at recent financial strength we can see it on a steady decline. The Current Ratio has moved from 0.81 in 17, to 0.51 in 2018, now to 0.47 as of Dec of 19. This is due to an increasing amount of leverage and debt the company is taking on to pay the operating expenses as it struggles to attract tower tenants. Currently, it has over $21b + of current debt which it will be unable to pay in a few months given the lack of cash flow it will have.\n\nTL-DR: Slowing demand for wireless communications and data processing will hurt tower demand forcing American Tower Corporation to reduce its dividend as it faces a lower credit rating, higher costs of capital, all caused by its massive debt levels.\n\nWhen this happens, investors will sell off the stock causing its price to drop dramatically in the upcoming few months.", "created_utc": 1584224601.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fiqr2v/amt_american_tower_corporation_overvalued_heavily/", "is_self": true}
