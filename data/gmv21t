Lost 90% of my account instead of making the \\~10,000 I would have made if I had held it for literally two more minutes.\n\nI feel like throwing up.   \n\n\nEdit: for clarity, I have an algo that predicted that drop was coming and just got in way to early but held because I knew it was coming. I know having your account down 90% on one position is absurd. But I wasn't just being retarded.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/okncypp8trz41.png?width=822&format=png&auto=webp&s=e91ce7fe196decef257785c3984b211c714fb1ba", "created_utc": 1589915428.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gmv21t/speechless/", "is_self": true}
