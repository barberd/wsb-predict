Not sure if any of you saw my post about having $0.13 left in my account last Thursday, but I said fuck it and put in an additional $420, lost $198 practically instantly, told myself I\u2019m done if I lose the $222 I have left and I'm deleting robinhood. Put the $222 into amazon FD\u2019s before earnings, Jeff Bezos saved the day. Sold Friday and bought TSLA FD's. Sold today, and here we are. $222 to $31,250. ALSO, I had $71 left in my TD account and said I'm only contributing to my Roth and buying stocks in that if I lose it all. An hour after purchasing the amazon FD's I get a kind call from a sweet man at TD to tell me my position is retarded and I'm gonna blow up the rest of my account. I appreciated the call but I insisted that it was not I, but he who was the retarded one (&amp; after Amazon earnings I gave him a call back but he didn't answer nor call me back). Sold next day and bought TSLA FD's. Sold today. $71 to $6,000 in that account. Across both accounts, $293 into $37,251 in three trading days. (All time is about +$14K for those wondering)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Never fucking give up, 12,613% gain in three days  \n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x9sdeumk0ye41.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85e425ec9d41c8c06ef183c813f4ee8333a6cd27\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/73ufcc6m0ye41.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1807f10d5c092284be49be8b80c171f095dc0f0", "created_utc": 1580838268, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eytsok/believe_it_or_not/", "is_self": true}
