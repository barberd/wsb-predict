{"id": "gns1nm", "title": "WMT ER - WTF happened!?!", "selftext": "Bag held this POS after MMs ran up the 6/19 130Cs to $7.70 late April and then unemployment numbers started beating everything down.\n\n1Q2020 ER: EPS surprise beat of $0.09, revenue surprise of $2.76B, e-commerce doubles. Then I watch WMT lose a $5 gap up and close fucking red. Finally closed out at $2.31.\n\n1. Is the market pricing in 2Q/3Q/4Q already? But aren't we pricing in NIRP yet?\n2. Some say WMT always shits the bed after ER, but could it have been something else (retards taking profit from retail over to tech maybe)?\n3. Also noticed, no forward guidance = stonks go down..?\n4. Also, I swear someone or an algo out there was shorting this thing religiously.\n\nI need closure faggots.
