DLTR has seen some recent declines due to weak forecasts and higher than anticipated expenses relating to the trade war. It has a very low PE with strong revenue. It\u2019s currently projecting a -9% YoY EPS with lower revenue as well. DLTR has no dividend payout.\n\n**Technical**: Priced below 20, 50, 200 day moving average. MACD shows bullish divergence. RSI shows around 35, oversold. Options sentiments are bullish in volume and very bullish open interest. Implied movement is 7.6% or about 6.25$ Short interest is at 1.9%, with 3.3 days to cover.\n\n**Sentimental**: Dollar tree was heavily affected by the china trade war last year and the stocks suffered due to soft guidance and missing earnings. As of now the stock is current very undervalued, and there are plans to have store turnaround that focus on interior remodeling and modernizing. While the trade war impact is lessened, the disrupted supply chain may continue to affect Dollar Tree\u2019s earnings, and given their previous mistake in underestimating a macro situation, I believe DLTR\u2019s management will guide meekly, leading to a relatively flat price action.\n\n**Robinhood (3/2/2020) Fucky. Not using.**\n\n**Call Credit Spread** \n\n**Buy 3/13 90 Call**\n\n**Sell 3/13 88 Call**\n\n**Iron Condor**\n\n**3/06 76/90 call/put, with 2$ width per wing.** \n\n**Dollar tree is currently losing to Dollar General in terms of store growth and appeal. While the PE and valuation are relatively low, this would be another potentially weak earnings beater due to macro considerations.**", "created_utc": 1583261380.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fczbd2/dollar_tree_dltr_342020_bmo_pretty_bad_pretty/", "is_self": true}
