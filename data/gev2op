I am a verified SEC lawyer and have been looking into the recent filings of a few of the larger Midwestern dri//ing companies. I am sorry to tell you this, but the tankers cannot make it there, for it is far inland. But do not go to your mom\u2019s boyfriend!\nA good portion of those filings mention a little company called Plains Group, which specializes in land-based crude storage. They just beat out earnings yesterday, but it looks like you mouth-breathed too much gaseous fluid on your Robinhood screen to notice yet, because prices are down. In fact, they have barely increased since the March 12 shit-show, even though they are doing great right now. When the next round of Contango hits in about 3 weeks, oil will shit itself again and inland storage prices will spike. This means if you have June call options for PAGP, you will have enough money in three weeks to afford a designer weighted blanket. Plus, earnings just came out so June $13 call prices are dirt cheap. \n\nDisclaimer: I am just a smart guy on the internet, so do your own research on what the potential profits from this play will look like.
