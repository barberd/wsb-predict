I've mostly been playing around with very cheap contracts to try and learn how IV affects the contracts value and so on. Anyways, I bought some GME puts expiring 10/11 at a $4.50 strike.

Any advice would be appreciated and make sure to roast me ;)", "created_utc": 1568923782, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d6jk0v/need_some_option_advice/", "is_self": true}
