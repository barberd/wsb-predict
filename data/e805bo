I bought the 50.50 puts and sold them off to other bidders when the price in the stock dipped.  I did this strategy twice and I was successful both times. However, a week ago I bought the same puts for 1.20 and I bought 7 contracts. The price has been were polar and gone up and done but never loved than the strike price. A bit scared, but I believe that this will strike price of 49.30 will be met by 12/27/2019.
