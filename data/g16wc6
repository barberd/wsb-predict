{"id": "g16wc6", "title": "The Corn-spiracy: Resurrection of the Corn", "selftext": "Alright guys, I know y'all don't talk too much about commodities, but I think I found the play of a lifetime. Let's get right to the point: I am long CORN.\n\nLet's start with the facts:\n\nCorn is used to make ethanol. You know who needs ethanol? Literally everyone, stupid. All the gas you waste \"racing\" your lowered mid 2000s honda civic with glass packs is at least 10% ethanol. Ethanol helps your engine run clean, burns more efficiently, and reduces emissions. If you just thought to yourself, \"Huh, no wonder the US subsidizes corn,\" then good, I'm glad you're with me. You know who ELSE just thought of this too? China. Fucking China, and they have much more buying power than the 1k your daddy let you play around with. China decided that even though they hate capitalism and donald pumperino, they do like living, and its time to burn oil a little cleaner around there. Long China? Long CORN. And guess what? You're in luck because CORN and CFD are the new SPCE, literally and figuratively. If you weren't aware, the aerospace industry uses ethanol based fuel, so if you're long SPCE, then you're long CORN too.\n\nRight now, US corn futures (CFD) are incredibly cheap, and the premiums go for even cheaper. For my fellow RH users, Teucrium Corn Fund (CORN) is the cheapest it has ever been, with every single OTM premium selling for cents on the dollar. Now, I know what you're thinking: \"This guy's name is raisinbrantflakes so he must be long BRAN.\" Well guess what, you're fucking wrong, I've been long corn way before you got your little bitch free stock on robinhood. Bran fucking sucks, and if you think bran is better than corn, you can fuck right off. Anyways, back to the facts.\n\nIf you look at the historical data, US corn futures always rise in the event of a recession. CFD skyrocketed in 08/09 as well as 2011, staying pretty high up there during the Obama administration. Corn inverses downward volatility, and guess what big guy? We are ready to POP again baby. Take a look at all the POPS on the five year chart for CORN. You see those POPS? Fucking straight up after months, if not, years of a downward trend, and we haven't had a POP for a long ass time. Like I said, I've been long CORN for years, and yeah I'm losing money, a lot. But those POPS have easily hedged my positions. Due to CORN, I have been able to retire at the ripe age of 94. Take THAT wsbGOD.\n\nWhere's that lizard that predicted SPY? Feed that fucker some corn and watch what happens. And for all you Elon Musk dick-riders, he burns way more ethanol than he saves. ;)\n\nTL;DR:\n\nCORN $13c 5/15 for unlimited tendies!\n\nLiterally can't go tits up!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7k0mkx9rqss41.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5aa58f7a4e98cfa6a2f3089226f52b083305eb66", "created_utc": 1586875852.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g16wc6/the_cornspiracy_resurrection_of_the_corn/", "is_self": true}
