My previous call was on MTY which rallied by over 12% since my last post. (deleted by mods for some reason -  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gth3cz/undervalued\\_restaurant\\_franchisor\\_a\\_case\\_for\\_mty/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gth3cz/undervalued_restaurant_franchisor_a_case_for_mty/) )\n\nHere's a second one for ya'll. Imperial Oil (an integrated petroleum company majority-owned by Exxon-Mobil).\n\n* Why you should invest:\n\n1. Expectation of recovery in industrials which will lead to increased consumption of petroleum products.\n2. [P/B at 0.71](https://web.tmxmoney.com/quote.php?qm_symbol=imo), stock currently below book value, with the industry average at 1.52 P/B.\n3. P/E at 10.16, [integrated oil industry P/E average at 14.0](https://csimarket.com/Industry/Industry_Valuation.php?ind=603). Massively undervalued compared to the industry.\n4. While they suffered a loss of 188million in Q1 2020 due to the OPEC spat, they have sizable cash reserve of over 1.7billion dollars and a quick ratio of 1.05. They are equipped to survive for the long haul.\n5. If you're into dividends, they're still paying dividends all the way up to March at 0.76/share.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Risks:\n\n1. V-shape recovery turns into a L-shape recovery and it turns into a long winter.\n2. Continued tension between Saudi+ Russia and the US O&G pushes oil back below breakeven price again [(approx- $36/bbl)](https://www.reuters.com/article/canada-energy-oilprice-idUSL2N0XE1D620150417)\n\nSource: [Financial Reports of Imperial Oil Corp](https://www.imperialoil.ca/-/media/Imperial/Files/Annual-and-quarterly-reports/2020_q1_interim_report.pdf)", "created_utc": 1591181206.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gvrpbc/undervalued_stock_imperial_oil_imo_below_pb_and/", "is_self": true}
