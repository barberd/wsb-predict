According to some nerd math shit called Gambler's Ruin [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s\\_ruin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_ruin), apparently even if you are bigly expected to win in any bet, if you bet too much or don't size down when you start losing, you'll eventually lose all your tendies. And since you need tendies to make tendies, no one wants that.\n\nSo what is the optimal betting size then? Fortunately some other nerds have figured out this math thing called Kelly's Criterion that tells you how much you should bet. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly\\_criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion) I know what you're thinking: \"Math shit??!!?? I can barely read, much less do fucking math! Just tell me what to do!!!\" Well fortunately, even if you can't do math, you can just go [https://dqydj.com/optimizing-bet-sizes-with-the-kelly-criterion/](https://dqydj.com/optimizing-bet-sizes-with-the-kelly-criterion/) and input some numbers and it'll tell you what to do.\n\nFor example, if you think that your 6/9 420 Tesla puts have a 50% chance to hit, and if you hit it pays off 2:1 (win 200 on a 100 dollar bet for 300 total dollars) and you have a bankroll of say 1000 bux, you can input those numbers into that website and it tells you you should bet 25% of your bankroll on each trade. The key thing here is that on the rare chance that you lose, **YOU NEED TO SIZE DOWN YOUR NEXT BET TO 25% OF YOUR NEW BANKROLL**. So, if you lose, you have to bet 25% \\* 750 (remaining money) and only bet 187.5 dollars for your next bet. If you don't size down when you lose, you *will* go broke, regardless of how good you are at picking options. And nobody wants to be out money to no longer be able to trade.\n\nTLDR: SPY 1 month 5% OTM puts with 10-20% of your bankroll (depending on how confident you are), size up or down repeat weekly with new bankroll size until you get all the tendies.", "created_utc": 1583860026.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fgh551/gamblers_ruin_kelly_criterion_optimal_bet_sizing/", "is_self": true}
