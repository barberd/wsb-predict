{"id": "h8bpb3", "title": "Why \"smart\" money is using media to discourage AAL holding", "selftext": "Currently AAL has 422,894,500 shares in the float. 87% is owned by institutions or insiders.  That's 367,918,215 shares leaving 57,976,285 shares to trade. Last short interest report from June 9th showed 126,980,000 shorted shares..... That's 72,003,715 to many... There is currently 644,263 Robin hood traders who own shares. If each of them owned 86 shares they would own the remainder of the float.. That's just Robinhood, this doesn't include all other trading platforms. I haven't looked but I'm sure that other airlines are similar.\n\nIf they were smart they were covering on the last drop. All pigs left short in airlines will continue to get squeezed.\n\nDon't get me wrong the fundamentals of airlines is not looking good. Stocks don't care though because you have to have someone buy and sell and right now nobody is selling just people shorting and covering themselves.\n\nNo current position but I will open Calls Monday, date and strike pending on Monday price action.\n\nIf you haven't noticed the whole stock market is like this right now. Fundamentals are crap and everyone is shorting everything. Until a big position dumps their shares this will continue. New traders are either Yolo options players or they are Chad and Karen who just opens an account and buys the newest trend moving up and has no intention of selling anytime soon because they \"bought the dip...\" So unless Blackrock or Vanguard dump their portfolios \"smart\" money is going to keep squeezing themselves trying to pick the top.\n\nTL;DR read above lazy ass", "created_utc": 1592069204.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h8bpb3/why_smart_money_is_using_media_to_discourage_aal/", "is_self": true}
