I opened up a RH account in 2014 with $200 and started trading with it at the end of 2018 of December 28th. I was too busy trading in my main account so I had forgotten about this small RH account. It's not much of a win, but the gain % was pretty big so I thought I'd share it with the community of fellow autistic and degenerate gamblers like myself.\n\n\\*I provided a imgur link with some pictures. [2019 Stats](https://imgur.com/a/zlQd53Q)\n\nI traded mostly SPY, AAPL, DIS, AMZN, FB, NUGT, and IBM. Most trades were CALLs and did not buy much PUTs. As you can see by the pictures, I withdrew $3,000 cash so I am adding that total into the gain; hence the $47,796.80. I dabbled with some weeklys and bi-weeklys, but mostly 1 month out options. with the strike price about 3% - 7% from the target price.\n\nAfter years of trial and error in my main account, I learned that booking a profit is a win; no matter how small or if you left bigger wins behind by selling early. The more ammo (cash) you have, the more positions you can take. The upward spikes and downward cliffs were the result of Trump's tweets with Xi Xi Panda, so they were obviously not expected.\n\nPictures: [2019 Stats](https://imgur.com/a/zlQd53Q) RH's interface is crap as you can see. Not sure why there is a minus, but it is what it is. I'll be switching to a different brokerage soon.\n\nMerry Christmas and Happy Holidays to everyone here and it is a pleasure reading all your posts whether it's a win or loss. Here's to a good 2020 for all of us!", "created_utc": 1577496598, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/egk5ue/year_end_update_from_200_to_4779680_journey/", "is_self": true}
