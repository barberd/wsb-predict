{"id": "cgh7p4", "title": "Streaming war prediction", "selftext": "Something funny is going on in the live streaming industry. I think, live streaming and on demand streaming will one day merge into one mega product in the market where a commanding part of this market will be from live streams. Recently YY bought BIGO Live. I have been following these apps closely so I signed up and it was actually addictive. Today I found another in my ads. It\u2019s called Live.me. Apart from them knowing to target advertise me based on my app usage is (eeekh!) the live.me app is blatantly identical to Bigo interface. So I\u2019m conjecturing that it\u2019s one of Chinese art of war thing - divide and conquer. I expect for more of these streaming services to be popping up but if you trace the ownership, it\u2019s probably affiliated with YY, directly or indirectly. Okay so should I sell some puts 3 months out expecting their profit will skyrocket?", "created_utc": 1563821159, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cgh7p4/streaming_war_prediction/", "is_self": true}
