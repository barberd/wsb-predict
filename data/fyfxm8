The FED is spending TRILLIONS of dollars to purchase junk, corporate, and fallen angel bonds**\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Federal Reserve Board has taken unprecedented action to purchase debt securities beginning with 1) expanded repo operations and treasury repurchases on 03/03/2020, 2) investment grade bonds, commercial paper, mortgage backed securities, and IG corporate bond ETFs on 03/30/2020, 3) junk grade bonds and junk bond ETFs on 04/09/2020. This multi-trillion dollar purchasing action has had the result of pushing up the prices of these securities AND the share prices of companies whose debt is being purchased. The illegal ramping caused by this purchasing is now allowing many of the Fed's cronies on Wall St to unload their shares of debt and equity securities at prices well above their fair value at tax payer expense.\n\nThese actions will further destroy our economy and lead to stagflation.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# [SIGN THE FUCKING PETITION HERE](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/stop-fed-money-printer-fed-spending-trillions-dollars-purchase-junk-corporate-and-fallen-angel-bonds)\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRipped from u/quantize_me's thread [\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bs, Recover your losses by reporting JPow's market manipulation to the SEC](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxw3qa/s_recover_your_losses_by_reporting_jpows_market/)\n\n[Here are the types of debt](https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/economy/why-did-yes-bank-collapse-from-bad-loans-to-rbis-negligence-are-the-reasons) we're bailing out due to [Shadow Lending](https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fe5s7e/the_fed_repos_are_an_attempt_to_prop_up_the/). Thanks to /u/Joesocktwo \n\nInspired by /u/cj16's post [UPDATED: Chamath Palihapitiya (chairman of SPCE) Interview on CNBC, Tears Apart CNBC Analysts Defending the Bailout of Hedgefunds and Billionaires (Full Audio Included)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxyhri/updated_chamath_palihapitiya_chairman_of_spce/) which has a great article by Social Capital's Chamath Palihapitiya who I was very impressed with. CNBC (fuck CNBC) article [here](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/chamath-palihapitiya-us-needs-to-let-hedge-funds-billionaires-fail.html) if you don't know whats going on with the FED.\n\n\u201cOn Main Street today, people are getting wiped out. Right now, rich CEOs are not, boards that have horrible governance are not. People are...What we\u2019ve done is disproportionately prop up poor-performing CEOs and boards, and you have to wash these people out.\n\nThere is a basic principle in capitalism, where at some point have to agree what the market clearing price is for risk and an asset. and right now what we've decided to do is pause that problem. and at some point we will need to restart that process if we intend to have some form of capitalism in the united states.\n\n**What the FED is doing is basically to obscure price.\"**\n\n\"I\u2019m not disagreeing with what the Fed has to do. What I\u2019m saying is it\u2019s creating a land mine, and it\u2019s creating a bill that will have to come due,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be better for the Fed to have given half a million to every man, woman and child in the United States,\u201d he added.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMeanwhile $1,200 pp stimulus checks have not been [issued](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/coronavirus-stimulus-checks-up-to-1200-arrive-soon-how-much-will-you-get-and-when/). SBA loans are woefully [inadequate](https://www.ibtimes.com/wells-fargo-hampered-regulatory-caps-already-exhausted-ppp-lending-capacity-2953583), with many banks [closing](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/04/the-small-business-loan-programs-big-problems-explained.html) their applications or requiring existing banking accounts to have been opened months earlier making many ineligible. CEOs are getting bailed out first.\n\nWhat are the consequences? Small and Medium sized businesses are going to be fucked. Only Fortune 500 corporations will benefit from this crisis and these megaliths will become even stronger as competition is cut.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFed Balance Book >$6 TRILLION [here.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_recenttrends.htm)\n\nEvery US tax payer has $194,613 of [debt they owe](https://www.usdebtclock.org/) to the Federal Government. That's you, reading this. And that amount is increasing with every FED [repo](https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/tomo-results-display?SHOWMORE=TRUE&startDate=01/01/2000&enddate=01/01/2000) operation. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Goal: 10,000 signatures.** \n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnswer to your future shit responses: Obviously this is coordinated by Trump and our federal government. Trump appointed Mnuchin, Mnuchin is the Treasury Secretary and determines FED policy (per his [interview Thursday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSGgW7XHpw0)). Mnuchin pressures Powell to BBRRR. Trump meets with Airlines, Hotels, Banks, MMs, and tells them what's up. CEO's get's bailed out in LESS THAN 1 MONTH of slowed revenues. **Loans at 0% interest aren't loans. It is free money.** \n\nIf we get 10,000 signatures, my hope is the media will force Legislatures to step in. Similar to the [Occupy Wall Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_Wall_Street) protests of 2011. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositions or ban?
