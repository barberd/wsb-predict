How about a long term investment in a trusted company like google, Apple, etc. ?\n\nCould I use millions of borrowed money to instantly go into retirement and live off the returns ?\n\nMy retirement is in 100% VTSAX. Could I use let\u2019s say 2M of RH\u2019s money to simulate that and collect something like 300k return yearly in our current market ?\n\nSend me your autism I\u2019m in need.", "created_utc": 1573081807, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dsodls/hi_im_retarded_i_dont_know_much_about_stocks_or/", "is_self": true}
