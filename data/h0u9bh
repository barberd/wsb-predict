{"id": "h0u9bh", "title": "A Tale of Two Streets", "selftext": "Main street is not wall street.\n\nDeflation will cause a stock market meltdown.\n\nThe Fed will not be able to prevent deflation unless it is proactive. (Which it won\u2019t be)\n\nIf the stock market continues to go up, the public will be up in arms about QE because they will claim it is unnecessary. The right will also veto stimulus checks because there is a false strength in the markets and perceived bounce back in unemployment. This will be problematic.\n\nCPI is still nowhere near February levels.\n\nCCI is still nowhere near February levels.\n\nConsumer Sentiment is still nowhere near February levels.\n \n2020 inflation rate as of May:\n0.1%\n\nUnemployment is up to 13.3%. It is not going back to 4%. Probably not even 6-7%. \n\nWhile wall street and main street do not reflect one another, they do have one common piece. Consumer spending and consumer confidence. With lack of consumer spending, earnings and income will be affected in the vast majority of stocks.\n\nThe problem becomes corporate debt and the inability of companies to pay it. The Fed can\u2019t bail out everybody. It would take $10T to bail out all corporations from their debt loads. The Fed can print, but not that much.\n\nRemember, COVID is still here, and even though Wall Street thinks it\u2019s gone, people are still not going out and spending their money. Consumer savings rates were up 63% in March and jumped from 13% to 33% in April. Obviously April\u2019s numbers are inflated, but the numbers show consumer saving was on the rise as it was. Consumers will be more likely to save now that we live in a post pandemic world where we are aware that anything can happen. Even if it\u2019s just for the short term (1-3 years), the impacts will be felt. \n\nLess consumers spending (unemployment) + more consumers saving does not paint a pretty picture for over-levered companies. \n\nOther impacts on spending include lower paying positions for those returning to work. Many furloughed employees are returning to work making less than they were earning previously. \n\nQE may have worked in 2008, but there is too much debt to buy this time around. QE will not work. The assets cannot be saved. The only way to keep the system intact is cash handouts, and now. Give people enough money that they feel they can light that shit on fire and it wouldn\u2019t matter. The current pent up demand is going to fizzle very quickly, and when Q3/Q4 roll around, earnings are going to be a lot uglier than people thought they would be.\n\nWe are in for a rollercoaster for the next few years, so buckle in and enjoy the ride. I couldn\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass if you think I\u2019m right or wrong, just set a remindme for anytime in a 1-3 year timeline from now and you will see for yourself where we are as a country. Bailouts have just begun, and even JPow is shaking at the knees right now.\n\nJPow had to cut interest rates until 2022. They will continue to go more negative as the Fed tries to stimulate spending. The market rallied on them cutting rates, but I see it as a major red flag. Powell is showing the markets how fucked our next few years are, but they took it as \u201cyay more cheap liquidity\u201d.\n\nThat being said, the run up is probably going to continue through the summer into the end of Q3, maybe even Q4. When we feel like we are truly \u201cpost COVID\u201d, the excuses for lack of consumer spending will be gone and the markets will have to reprice themselves.\n\nTLDR;\nSPY put LEAPS and log out of RH for a year.\n\nDeflation is coming because the markets are showing false strength and Donald is too fucking stupid to realize what\u2019s ahead of us. \n\nOnly savior is direct payments to consumers.\n\nWill take a while for this to set in, Wall Street will continue it\u2019s delusion through the summer and maybe fall/winter.", "created_utc": 1591859538.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h0u9bh/a_tale_of_two_streets/", "is_self": true}
