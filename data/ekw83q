{"id": "ekw83q", "title": "New to options", "selftext": "I have saved up $1000 and I want to start trading options. I have paper traded since last year but mainly just equity with a few yolo calls on earnings days with variable success. I\u2019ve done the free education offered by TD so I know about debit, credit spreads etc and see options as a good way to grow my account faster than equity with such little capital. What I am wondering is would now be a good time to start due to the geopolitical tension around Iran. Many say it\u2019s short term volatility. In addition to this all the well know Bluechip stocks seem too overvalued to buy but at the same time stocks only go up so I\u2019m on the hedge about puts.\n\nAny recommendations or tips would be appreciated.", "created_utc": 1578327475, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ekw83q/new_to_options/", "is_self": true}
