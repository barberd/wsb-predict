So, for good reason I can see why Zoom is going up but I would like to provide some evidence for investors speculating on earnings growth for this company to think again. Most companies offering these services are offering free trials during the coronavirus cases or just offer free services in general. Which, will not help Zoom earn more money. Moreover, Zoom has a free service and I am positive that all students will be using the free version over the paid version. The company is already highly overpriced and I believe it is upon pure speculation and idiots buying a panacea instead of pure fundamentals and reality. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSource:  [https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/3/11/21173449/microsoft-google-zoom-slack-increased-demand-free-work-from-home-software](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/3/11/21173449/microsoft-google-zoom-slack-increased-demand-free-work-from-home-software) \n\nFundamentals:  [https://www.google.com/search?safe=strict&tbm=fin&sxsrf=ALeKk01cMYlz4fT4p1EwqB2KPVLeB8HB3A:1584043063598&q=NASDAQ:+ZM&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgecRowS3w8sc9YSn9SWtOXmPU5OIKzsgvd80rySypFJLmYoOyBKX4uXj10\\_UNDTMMDcoMs81MeBaxcvk5Brs4BlopRPkCANqtdexKAAAA#scso=\\_PJRqXoiAFaOhytMPo8u-uA01:0,\\_QZRqXuLFBNeuytMPl5Wu4Ac1:0](https://www.google.com/search?safe=strict&tbm=fin&sxsrf=ALeKk01cMYlz4fT4p1EwqB2KPVLeB8HB3A:1584043063598&q=NASDAQ:+ZM&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgecRowS3w8sc9YSn9SWtOXmPU5OIKzsgvd80rySypFJLmYoOyBKX4uXj10_UNDTMMDcoMs81MeBaxcvk5Brs4BlopRPkCANqtdexKAAAA#scso=_PJRqXoiAFaOhytMPo8u-uA01:0,_QZRqXuLFBNeuytMPl5Wu4Ac1:0) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPuts are very cheap and I expect this company to be at a $70 share very soon.", "created_utc": 1584043157.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhmhsm/why_zm_is_a_horrible_investment/", "is_self": true}
