Now, this is not the first time that this happens. I realized that it has gone several times throughout this event. PCG is essential for millions of people and even if they sign bankruptcy, they will not be delisted or neither the stock will get to $0. \n\nMy recommendation is to buy spreads for around 2 years. You will get a safe 200% up with not problem and even more. You can also buy the shares too which can be safer.", "created_utc": 1573059174, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dsj1f0/pcg_is_a_great_long_term_buy_at_these_prices/", "is_self": true}
