I understand that NORMALLY banks won't let you sell your house without paying back the mortgage because its their only collateral forcing repayment of the loan. However since this is loan is guaranteed by the federal government would the bank be okay with me selling the house and just continuing to make payments? Is there anyway I could negotiate this or make it work? \n\nIf this is  possible it would actually just be free fucking money", "created_utc": 1572949751, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/drxcs4/selling_home_to_gamble/", "is_self": true}
