The world is going to end anyway, might as well exit a very rich man.\n\nI sold out of NNVC, after buying it on Friday. I know, genius. I also bought COCP (cock penis) after they released this news today:\n\n*Cocrystal Pharma, Inc. Announces License Agreement With Kansas State University Research Foundation For Norovirus And Coronavirus Antiviral Compounds*\n\nIt might still have room to run. \n\nNext on the agenda is AHPI. They supply respiratory products, which is interesting because of this headline.\n\n*Coronavirus patients need a month or more on mechanical ventilators, and that's putting a strain on hospitals*\n\nLastly, I won't bore you with the usual face mask plays like APT and LAKE. Fuck them. How about home schooling. No one will be able to leave the house soon and our buildings will be WELDED shut. Ergo, and this goes without saying, the kids still need to learn, lest they're grow up to be idiots.\n\nChinese online edu plays are fucking running.\n\nCOE, GSX, and DAO. My favorite is DAO.\n\nFeel free to add your picks. But they better be good.", "created_utc": 1582560767, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8th9h/virus_stocks_on_fire_again_get_in_here_and_post/", "is_self": true}
