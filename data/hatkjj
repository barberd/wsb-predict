{"id": "hatkjj", "title": "Another PCG shitpost", "selftext": "TLDR for the kids that don't read good and want to do other stuff good to: is that PCG is a huge gamble, lots of good, lots of bad, only buy if you have balls of steel and are comfortable with <50% losses because god hates me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOkay I will apologize in advance, my brain don't work in linear fashion so big paragraph don't come easy to me in organize fashion\n\nOkay so we can clearly see we've been getting dunked on for the past 3 weeks. I bought it right before the pump to 13.30 (so around 12.50 or something) so I've been bag holding for some time. Feels good.\n\nRecent Bloomberg article points to the fact that with the new Fed bond buying SPV that there's a potential the PCG could qualify for free printer money, I see this as good.\n\nPCG owes victims lots of money, they plan to issue money in the form of shares with a 90 day lockout. Problem is we don't know what the issuing price will be, although it was proposed (and attacked by victim lawyer) that the issuing price be based on when the fires occurred (maybe around $30, the rough november 8th price). I don't know if the lawyer for the victims was successful in that argument, I didn't get to finish watching.\n\nThey are selling 3.25 Billion to Fidelity, Appaloosa, Third Point, and Zimmer partners. Based on the article from a few weeks ago that will be UP TO 10.50 a share. This could be bad, if they are receiving them at a percentage based discount from market, it would be in there best interest to keep the share price low. The deal is contingent on the emergence approval.\n\nLast thing I feel is semi-important is the judge is supposedly going to confirm whether the emergence is approved or denied today, but there's still details to work out and those may impact future prices.\n\n**Conclusion: Do not buy PCG calls, this is more for the fags that have calls already (myself). It hurts real bad.** ***Think of it as a support thread, the support is life support.***\n\nAlso every time this comes up someone comments \"but they just plead guilty to killing a bunch of people\". Yes you are correct and this has been known about for a while. The reason they are in this situation is exactly this. Since then They have changed management, got lots of debt monies, and HUGE upgrades to existing infrastructure (by the way the assets of the company are around 90 Billion, they are valued at like 6 Billion market cap).\n\nBiggest takeaway is that **nobody knows what they don't know.** And for that I ask that you **do not listen to me**. ( I don't know what I'm doing, what are calls?)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/UsaSmyE](https://imgur.com/a/UsaSmyE) also check this guy out (judge)\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pg-e-bankruptcy-judge-says-180857710.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pg-e-bankruptcy-judge-says-180857710.html)\n\nThat's bloomberg saying they don't know if PCG qualifies for bonds but maybe.", "created_utc": 1592408322.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hatkjj/another_pcg_shitpost/", "is_self": true}
