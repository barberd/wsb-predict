{"id": "fkxn3m", "title": "Order Execution Between Brokers", "selftext": "So, I use TDA, Merrill Edge, Fidelity, and OptionsHouse (Etrade calls it something else now, whatever)...I noticed that my OptionsHouse orders have totally different spreads while watching both live.  When I'm buying, the bid/ask shows a lower price than the other two.  By the time the other two \"catch up\", OH is even lower...\n\nThis is very consistent.  Same thing when I use Fidelity ActiveTrader Pro over the web interface....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyone else notice this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:  [https://imgur.com/a/YRu66I2](https://imgur.com/a/YRu66I2)", "created_utc": 1584567150.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkxn3m/order_execution_between_brokers/", "is_self": true}
