Since its cumbersome to rebalance their holdings, the Federal Reserve will loan banks money overnight to meet this reserve requirement. This is \"the rate\" the Federal Reserve actually sets, aka the *Fed Funds rate*. If you can borrow overnight from the Federal Reserve at 1.25%, all your other rates for shit follows from that floor.\n\n**What are these \"Repo\" operations?**\n\nVery short term loans, usually 1-3 nights, given to primary (institutional) borrowers. They are the tool the Fed uses to hit rate targets. If the Federal Reserve is loaning you big cheap money, you are free to put that money elsewhere.\n\n**What are bonds? What is the difference between yield and price? What's the 10-year treasury stuff?**\n\nBonds are loans that are traded as securities much the same way shares are ownership traded as securities. If the price to buy a bond goes up, the yield on that bond goes down, because you have paid more for the defined cash flow. *The crash in the 10 year treasury yield is because institutions are rushing to buy them instead of stocks, driving the price up and the yields down.*\n\n**Get cucked, Powell. Banks are taking your liquidity and doing fuckall with it.**", "created_utc": 1583427873, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fdyb14/an_autists_guide_to_the_macro_picture_repos_10y/", "is_self": true}
