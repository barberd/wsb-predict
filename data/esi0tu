{"id": "esi0tu", "title": "BYND &amp; MSFT Earnings", "selftext": "I bought CALLS for BYND and MSFT this week and wanted to get a second opinion from you autists. \n\nReasoning:\nBYND (Earnings : Jan 27) - McDonald's and Starbucks added Beyond Meat to their menus recently. The stock is probably oversold again(around $120) however, I do believe it go up till $150-160 before touching ground again. \n\nMSFT (Earnings : Jan 29)- Their cloud business has been rapidly expanding. Plus the JEDI Contract. Their office suite was also upgraded recently and the office suite sales are also growing because of the variety of products they offer to businesses.", "created_utc": 1579726433, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/esi0tu/bynd_msft_earnings/", "is_self": true}
