I've an equity portfolio that I've built up over the past few years of using good ole' buy and hold. I held ALLLL the way down through the crash in Q4, didn't know about options at the time and didn't want to sell as I'd incur a large tax (although never really thought it would go THAT low) and missed my chance to sell before stuff started plummeting.\n\nDon't want to make the same mistake with this trade war stuff kicking off again now so wanted to get some advice on how best to hedge my account. \n\nAny help anyone could give would be much appreciated, the account is mostly tech based (Amazon, Apple, AMD, Alphabet and Nvidia make up 70+%) so quite closely correlated with SPY, so I was thinking SPY puts? Presumably, best thing is buy them ATM for a number of months out (was thinking Dec), but if anyone has any advice on more specifics of how best to do it I'd really appreciate some advice.", "created_utc": 1565470783, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/conkkv/looking_for_help_and_advice_how_best_to_hedge_my/", "is_self": true}
