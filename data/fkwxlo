{"id": "fkwxlo", "title": "RH canceling confirmed trades after market close?", "selftext": "Robinhood has now canceled two of my confirmed trades during regular trading hours in the last week after the market close (one of them was today). Both were  (VXX, SPY) with healthy gains and both of them lost value the next day (near expiration).\n\nI of course sent them an email with screenshots but they silently ignore.\n\nAny one else in the same boat? What are you planning to do? Buy more puts and forget?\n\nEdit: It got filled during regular hours (showed the price at which the trade was executed and I got a confirmation email) but after market close it shows as canceled. It was NOT a pending limit 'good for the day' order that gets canceled as some of you have noted.", "created_utc": 1584564702.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkwxlo/rh_canceling_confirmed_trades_after_market_close/", "is_self": true}
