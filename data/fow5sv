THIS IS SERGEANT TENDY COMING IN FOR DUTY, SIR!\n\nI\u2019m writing this post after sniffing a whole bunch of jet fuel. I may be loopy!\n\nAirlines are flying planes quite literally throwing money out the window as they cross over the QUARANTINED STATES OF AMERICA!!!! \n\nLoads are coming down like your wife\u2019s boyfriend goes DOWN. Take this opportunity and buy some puts while we rebound from this stimulus package. \n\nKey figures for the degenerates:\n\n- Airline have 4-5% profit margin with 85% load factors\n\n- Load factors today are down exponentially from 85%\n\n- Airlines can\u2019t keep flying empty planes. It makes NO sense. \n\n- There will be more bad news on flight loads and flight cancelations in the coming weeks \n\n- The Airline bailout is good news... TO BUY MORE PUTS\n\n- The bailout comes in the form of a loan ... adding even more debt to their riddled balance  sheets \n\n- There are no grants in this stimulus package. In 2008, there were grants given to the airlines... that\u2019s basically free money\n\n- Every airline exec has said, \u201cthis is worse than 2008!\u201d\n\n- if it\u2019s worse... that means airline stock prices should be back at 2008 levels.. BUY PUTS\n\n- International travel for airlines is halted!\n\n- This virus won\u2019t stop overnight. Don\u2019t be silly. Ignore the news and imagine... is anyone booking any air travel any where any time at any point in the next 3-6 months. NO!!!\n\n- As corporations are airlines biggest consumers... if there is a looming recession... the last thing corporations want to do is to go back to paying for flights \n\n- Stocks don\u2019t gotta straight down in a recession... they need to go up a little so we can buy some more puts. \n\nI hope you enjoyed this.. for those who can\u2019t read...\n\nTL;DR: JETS PUTS $20 6/19 - $5.30", "created_utc": 1585163466.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fow5sv/airlines_how_to_fly_high/", "is_self": true}
