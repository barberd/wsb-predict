{"id": "f7eynh", "title": "Etsy DD - Engineering hiring is up 12%", "selftext": "Etsy has earnings coming up Wednesday and I think calls are in order based off their hiring patterns and a few other metrics. \n\n---\n\nIf you take a look at their metrics for employees hired, they are hiring a ton of engineers. Engineers means they are expanding, adding more space, and growing. Etsy isn't really a sales org because they aren't doing the selling, the users are. So how do you measure growth? You check their hiring for engineers which is up 12%.\n\nEtsy employee growth: https://i.imgur.com/uiLdskc.png\n\n---\n\nTheir best earnings report to come out was after Q4 2018. That's because people buy handmade gifts off Etsy for Christmas. This is always their best quarter for growth.\n\nYou might also think that etsy just offers bracelets made by hippies but that is not so. Their users offer services. I use them all the time. Need a resume written because you were buying puts all last year instead of calls? You can find hundreds of people selling resume services on Etsy.\n\n---\n\nTLDR; ETSY 3/20 60c", "created_utc": 1582308207, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7eynh/etsy_dd_engineering_hiring_is_up_12/", "is_self": true}
