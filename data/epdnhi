These are all great for the latest annual report. Over the past ten years, however, they're not.\n\nI saw the same phenomenon for WW, the only other company over the past 10 months of analysis, since finishing the BUS123W course, which has come close to passing through the framework. The market loved WW regardless and it's gone up 150+% since hitting the cheap price calculated according to the course framework, $17.24. So this makes me wonder if the market will ignore the long term geometric means for the 4 /FDS growth metrics for American Eagle also, and bid it up because of its great ROCE and, the the past year at least, great growth?\n\nDo you have any experience or thoughts on this?", "created_utc": 1579145846, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/epdnhi/how_the_market_responds_to_geometric_means_of_fds/", "is_self": true}
