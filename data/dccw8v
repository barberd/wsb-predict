(LEN + $1.49 to $57.21) after the Miami-based home builder reported Q3 earnings of $1.59 per share ($0.27 beat) on revenue that rose 3.3% year-over-year to $5.86B (above the $5.48B expected). Deliveries increased 7% to 13,522 homes while new orders increased 9% to 13,369 new homes. Shares of LEN are trading at a 52-week high this morning and from a technical perspective, it appears that the stock is breaking out (to the upside) from a longer-term (bullish) inverse head and shoulders pattern. Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 2:1 with the October 18th 57.50 call topping the most actives list (volume is 1,505).   \n\nAlso trading to the upside is Dow-component Johnson &amp; Johnson Inc. (JNJ + $3.12 to $133.11) following news that the drug maker announced a settlement with two Ohio counties ahead of an upcoming opioid trial. Under the terms of the settlement, JNJ will make a combined $10M settlement payment to the counties, reimburse $5M in legal fees and provide a $5.4M charitable contribution to non-profit organizations in connection with opioid-related programs in these two counties. Calls and puts are trading roughly even with the November 15th 130.00 put seeing the most action from traders (volume is 4,464).\n\n \n\nNew 52-week highs (8 new highs today): American Homes 4 Rent Inc. (AMH + $0.04 to $25.89), HCP Inc. (HCP + $0.04 to $35.75), Pultegroup Inc. (PHM - $0.31 to $36.12)\n\nNotable Call Activity\n\nA couple of drug makers are seeing some unusual call activity this morning, perhaps in response to the JNJ news mentioned above:\n\nMylan N.V. (MYL - $0.36 to $18.47): Calls are outpacing puts roughly 7:1 which is primarily being driven by a 20K block that was bought on the November 15th 20.00 call at the ask price of $1.12 (open interest is 1,413). We know this block is a new position given the open interest figure and we can assume the intent is bullish in nature since the trade took place at the ask price.\nTeva Pharmaceuticals Inc. (TEVA + $0.22 to $6.98): Calls are outpacing puts roughly 3:1 which is primarily being driven by activity on the November 15th 8.00 call (volume is 11,949 vs. open interest 829). However, the majority of the transactions on this contract consisted of various sized blocks that were being sold at various times at the bid prices of $0.33 and $0.34, which suggests that these call sellers don\u2019t see TEVA closing above the $8.00 price level at expiration.   \n \nToday\u2019s Bearish Activity \n\nLeading the point decliners list over on the NYSE this morning is Acuity Brands Inc. (AYI - $20.80 to $109.66) after the lighting and building management solutions company reported fiscal Q4 adjusted diluted EPS of $2.75 ($0.06 miss) on net sales of $938.1M (below the $1.03B expected). Shares of AYI are trading at the lowest levels since last December where it got as low as $103.48, which represent a five-year low. Puts are slightly outnumbering calls but the October 18th 135.00 call is the most actively traded contract (volume is 153).\n\nAlso trading to the downside is Stitch Fix Inc. (SFIX - $2.71 to $17.35) after the online fashion stylist site reported fiscal Q4 earnings of $0.07 per share ($0.03 beat) on revenue that rose 35.8% year-over-year to $432.1M (roughly in-line with the $432.44M consensus estimate) as net revenue per active client increased 9.0% year-over-year to $488. The company issued downside Q3 revenue guidance of $438-442M (vs. the $451.29M consensus estimate) and in-line full-year 2020 revenue guidance of $1.90-1.93B (vs. the $1.92B consensus estimate). If you read Monday\u2019s blog you might recall that SFIX was highlighted under \u201cVolume Signals\u201d for unusual put buying on the October 18th 14.00 put. Puts are outnumbering calls nearly 2:1 with the January 2020 80.00 put leading the way (volume is 50).    \n\n \n\nNew 52-week lows (163 new lows today): Abiomed Inc. (ABMD - $2.04 to $168.17), CBS Corp. (CBS - $0.77 to $39.40), Teredata Corp. (TDC - $0.49 to $29.53), Viacom Inc.-Class A (VIA - $0.51 to $25.74)\n\nNotable Put Activity\n\nSome unusual put activity (better than 3:1 over calls) is being seen in Ford Motor Co. (F - $0.35 to $8.54) which is primarily being driven by activity on the November 15th 8.00 put. Volume on this contract is 43,158 (vs. open interest of 701) which mostly consisted of various-sized blocks that were being sold at the bid price of $0.20 and $0.21, including a 30.78K block that was sold at the bid price of $0.20. We know this ~30K block is a new position given the open interest figure and we can assume that the block trader either believes that F will remain at or above $8.00 or is comfortable taking a long ~3.08M share position in the stock at an effective purchase price of $7.80 in the event that it closes below $8.00 at expiration.  \n\nWalmart Inc. (WMT - $1.17 to $116.68): Puts are outpacing calls better than 5:1 which is primarily being drive by a 12.30K block that was sold on the January 2020 105.00 put at the bid price of $1.34 (open interest is 8,501). We know this 12.30K block is a new position given the open interest figure and we can assume that the block trader either believes that WMT will remain at or above $105.00 or is comfortable taking a long 1.23M share position in the stock at an effective purchase price of $103.66 in the event that it closes below $105.00 at expiration.  \n\nVolume Signals     \n\nHuntsman Corp. (HUN - $0.35 to $22.11): Option volume is running at over 20x the daily average of 192 contracts which is primarily being driven by a couple of fairly large blocks that simultaneously traded out on the November 15th expiration:\n\n23.00 call \u2013 a 1,250 block traded for $1.05, directly in the middle of the $1.00 x $1.10 bid/ask spread (open interest is 404)\n25.00 call \u2013 a 2,500 block was sold for $0.39 (open interest is 325)\nWe know these blocks are new positions based on the open interest figures and it appears that a call front spread was established for a net debit of $0.27 (x 1,250 contracts x 100 multiplier, excluding commissions) which suggests that the block trader believes that HUN can rally higher in the coming months and close at or near the maximum gain price of exactly $25.00 at expiration.  \n\nFidelity National Information Services (FIS - $2.19 to $129.07): Option volume is running at roughly 16x the daily average of 249 contracts which is primarily being driven by a 2,878 block that was bought on the November 15th 130.00 call at the ask price of $5.50 (open interest is 2,702). We know this block is a new position and we can assume that the block trader believes that FIS will close above the break-even price of $135.50 at expiration.  \n\nBorg Warner Inc. (BWA - $1.14 to $34.79): Option volume is running at roughly 8x the daily average of 442 contracts which is primarily being driven by activity on the December 20th 27.50 put. Volume on this contract is 3,001 versus open interest of 171, so we know that this primarily represents new positioning. Nearly all of the volume on this contract is being attributed to a 1,800 block that was bought for $0.45 and (around the same time) a 1,200 block that was bought for $0.50 when the bid/ask spread was $0.00 x $0.60 (both suggesting bearish intent).  \n\nGauging Volatility\n\nThe CBOE Volatility Index (VIX + 2.30 to 20.86) has been in positive territory all day today (intraday range is 18.75-21.07) as equity markets remain in risk-off mode around the mid-day mark today (DJI - 483, SPX - 51, COMPX - 128). VIX option volume has been above average today at 364,466 contracts (#4 on the top 10 most actives list) and the activity has been call-biased (the volume put/call ratio is currently 0.50). The most actively traded contract is the November 20th 35.00 call as volume is 50,364 versus open interest of 88,079.", "created_utc": 1570034990, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dccw8v/options_market_10219/", "is_self": true}
