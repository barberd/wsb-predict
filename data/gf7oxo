Who is going in on cloudflare?  How much?  Anyone get in on any of the others?  What small DD I have done appears CF to be seriously on the rise, I have one more trick up my sleeve I'm about to pull and maybe get some serious direction on it and I'll update if it works.  It does concern me though because hot hands fallacy is TOTALLY at work here seeing all these other cloud based tech companies geyser cash it makes me wonder doesn't at least one have to take a shit?  Opinions?  How you playing it?  DD?  Positions?  Are you laying your dick on the table?  Or just one nut?  Keeping your whole package tucked away tight cause your a shallow pocketed bitch? Yea, I love redheads.  They make everything so much better.... or so much worse.  Just like cloudflare is about to do\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ru5y5yl5ucx41.jpg?width=620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=78b3dbcb8a73b9ad3ef58d020027edf00e3ab205", "created_utc": 1588862175.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gf7oxo/cloudflare_hot_hands_fallacy_addictive_tendencies/", "is_self": true}
