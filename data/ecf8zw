I also joined Theta Gang by selling a march 2020 put with strike 2.00 USD for 0.35 USD today.\n\nPlease let me know what your current ACB position and average price is, so I can feel better about my own (paper) losses.\n\nAny DD about ACB and cannabis stocks in general is also very much welcome. For example: which future events could drive the stonk price higher and which of those events are most likely to materialise?", "created_utc": 1576688343, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ecf8zw/acb_what_is_your_current_position_and_at_what/", "is_self": true}
