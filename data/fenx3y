Sure most stocks are down and these def had a justifiable reason to sell off but 50%??\n\nListen I kno tendies are to be made here. Surely we are almost at the peak of this shitshow. The ones to lose the most should be the most to be rewarded.  Not saying today was the last day of a sell off but I'm saying hold 3-6 months and by summer you can see 50-100% your investment.  Summer time is going to rock these stocks socks.. bunch of families off looking for a cheap vacation and by then either we will all be dead or the hype will be dead.\n\nEither way you're buying stocks at a 50% discount. Naysers will say nah of course but smart money swoops in when opportunity arises.
