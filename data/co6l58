{"id": "co6l58", "title": "Overstock (OSTK) possible short squeeze in play", "selftext": "OSTK is the stock to follow over the next couple of weeks if you're looking for another BYND-like situation where longs force the price up to try to get shorts to capitulate.\n\nThis looks like a potential short squeeze in motion. S3's pre-earnings update: \" [$OSTK](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24OSTK&amp;src=cashtag_click) short int is $381 mm; 17.23 mm shs shorted; 60.81% of float; 61.86% borrow fee. Shs shorted are up +4.8 mm,+38.4%, in 2019; +637k, +3.84%, over the last 30 days; but down -618k, -3.46%, over the last week. There has been some covering ahead of the [#Overstock](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Overstock?src=hashtag_click)'s earnings. \"\n\nObviously OSTK hit it out of the park on earnings and is near $25, but there was some covering before earnings, so we need to wait and see what the current short interest/borrow fee levels are next week.\n\nWe'll have to see how the short interest and numbers look in the days ahead post-earnings bump. Might be best to just keep it in mind and follow the short interest/borrow fee levels. If the shorts cover too quickly and borrow fees come down fast, there won't be much of a squeeze here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe squeeze scenario probably requires short interest to stay over 50% and borrow fees stay over 50% which would lead algs/longs to try to force this to mid-30s or higher.  My advice is to let the IV come down and see if there's some calm before another potential leg up develops.\n\nNote that in 2017 when it mooned, OSTK was just following BTC due to crypto announcements they made. There might be some of that kind of effect at play too given their blockchain work with tZero; so crypto rocketing due to currency war probably helps this thesis.", "created_utc": 1565376047, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/co6l58/overstock_ostk_possible_short_squeeze_in_play/", "is_self": true}
