You might remember my previous posts telling you to [buy calls on a company that eats the poor for money](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g8od1g/cacc_subprime_autoloans_are_totally_gonna_go_tits/), and urging you to [hoard gold like some autistic mountain dragon](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gcdjeo/dd_gld_stagflation_and_you/). \n\n\n\n\n\nFor today's installment, I wanted to show use a 10K to understand why the market might price things the way they do. A 10K is a free, publicly available document that Michael Burry said every good investor should read. Obviously, there are no good investors in WSB, but I love shouting uselessly into the void, so here we are. \n\n\n\n\n\nA 10K is usually a large document comprised of a bunch of information about a company's risks, financials, direction, and operations. Its a single all encompassing primer on the company and its vision of its future. However, today I am going to focus on one of the most accessible parts: The Balance Sheet. The balance sheet, cash flows, and a few other segments are actually not written by the company, but by an independent auditor who is required to comply with auditing standards called GAAP. This means that while a company can still engage in some fuckery, you can be pretty sure that the balance sheets and cash flow statements are basically true and correct. \n\n\n\n\n\nA balance sheet is essentially a snapshot of everything the business owns, and everything in owes. The sheet always appears in balance as **Assets=Liabilities+Equity**   Let take a look at the balance sheet for two companies you are all familiar with: America's two largest chicken tendie manufacturers: Sanderson Farms ($SAFM) and Tyson Foods ($TSN). Both are major players in the livestock/protein agribusiness sector, so why then do we see SAFM trading at around 146 with an insanely high P/E of 100.62. Tyson, in contrast, is trading at 59 with a P/E of 10. Why the hell does the market think Sanderson has 10x the potential of Tyson? Lets look at their balance sheets to find out. \n\n\n\n\n[Tyson's Balance Sheet is here](https://imgur.com/O9zBuco)\n\n\n\n\n[Sanderson's Balance Sheet is here](https://imgur.com/a/kDI8YvR)\n\n\n\n\nNow, a balance sheet is not a reflection of sales or cash flow, it is a snapshot in time. Lets look at what each major category means:\n\n\n\n\n* Current Assets: This is everything the business owns that is quickly convertible to cash. This is stuff that you could turn into money generally quickly. These are the tendies on your plate(inventories), in your hand (cash), or the ones your mom is walking down the basement stairs with (account receivable)\n\n\n\n\n\n* Net Property Plant, Equipment: This is obviously the plants, processing machines, offices, computers, and other business stuff they company owns. This is like, the oven, the fridge, the plate, the honey mussy, that all go into making your delicious tendies.\n\n\n\n\n\n* Goodwill or intangibles. This is things that aren't really....real. Sometimes it is things that really do have a clear value, like a patent on a way to process chicken, or a specific breed of bird. But sometimes it's, more wishy washy, like 'reputation' or 'brand recognition'. If you compare the balance sheets, Tyson argues that it has a ton of intangibles and goodwill, like tens of billions of dollars in goodwill. Ok buddy. Sure you do. In contrast, Sanderson's balance sheet doesn't really need intangibles and brand recognition to prop it up. It lumps those into a small 'other assets' category.  This is like mommy's love for you. I'm sure mommy loves you, but if you are relying on that to balance out your good boy points and tendies, you might have a structural issue. \n\n\n\n\n* Liabilities. This is an easy one. Current liabilities are the debt that is due this year, and long term debt is everything else. Look at Tyson, if you total it's debts, they are over 50% of assets, and most of that is long term debt. They also have a lot of current liabilities for their cash on hand. If you're an investor, this is a sign that you need to dig deeper. In contrast, Sanderson has few liabilities, and hardly any long term debt. Total liabilities are only about 20% of assets\n\n\n\n\n* Equity. This is the value of shares outstanding. It important to understand Equity is the value of the shares when they were issued times the number of shares issued. It's not the current market cap. You can see, Sanderson hooks shareholders up. Because of the little debt, tons of the company's sweet sweet tendies go straight to shareholder's pockets. No debt servicing here. In contrast, Tyson will need to spend a lot of money to service that debt, leaving less for shareholders.\n\n\n\n\nNow, if you're an investor, which company is better poised to weather the storm of economic uncertainty? Obviously, Sanderson. They can take on debt to finance operations, especially at these historically low interest rates, and once the market stabilizes, they can start buying up the assets of the competitors that have failed. Based on this P/E of 100, the market seems to believe that Sanderson is going to outlast the competition and become the literal Tendie God. \n\n\n\n\nI would love to recommend a play in all this. Common sense says the market has not fully priced in the risks to Sanderson, and Tyson will struggle to weather the market disruptions to poultry prices, demand etc. However, in this opposite bizzaro dimension, we should all do the opposite of common sense. So calls on Tyson and Sanderson.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n YOLO", "created_utc": 1588951347.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfv49n/a_tale_of_two_tendieshow_i_learned_to_stop/", "is_self": true}
