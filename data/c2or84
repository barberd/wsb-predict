I got some suggestions and most of them were shit so I changed my mind. \n\nThis company as most of you know operates in the CBD space. They currently benefit from first mover advantage and are actually able to turn a profit. These facts drew me in initially, and then I saw a few articles about expanding farm operating just to keep up with current demand. On top of that they have a potential deal with Amazon coming down the pipeline and new products coming to market in 2019.\n\nYoY net income dropped last quarter, but they did see revenue growth of 66% and currently have a forward PE of 17. Their chart is less than stellar due to the IPO hype we\u2019ve been seeing lately. \n\nI do think they retraced to a normalize level and could see some major gains. So far I\u2019ve benefitted from lucky timing, but could see this as a company worth looking at going forward.\n\nThis is as quick of an analysis I could do on my commute into work. Anyone else been looking into this company?", "created_utc": 1560988957, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c2or84/cwbhf/", "is_self": true}
