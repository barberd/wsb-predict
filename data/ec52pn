I have for sure never installed that shit. I went into my history and apparently it was added to my account about a month ago..suspicious.\n\nsecond, when I clicked the on button the audio for the ad IMMEDIATELY started playing, mid way through ad. I have my TV set to go to sleep mode and not turn off all the way..but let's say hypothetically I DID have newsy, and somehow blacked out last night in the middle of ad 4 of 8..it saved my spot IN THE AD?\n\nI think roku is doing some sketchy shit, watching random apps while your TV is in sleep mode to boost numbers. time for puts", "created_utc": 1576630381, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ec52pn/i_suspect_roku_is_fudging_usage_numbers/", "is_self": true}
