(DKNG)", "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Draftkings (DKNG)?\n\nThey are an online-only gambling company based in the USA. A lot of high profile investors like George Soros, Shalom Meckenzie and Disney have massive stakes in DKNG, and DKNG's share price is also up 75% since their IPO in April 2020.\n\nPersonally, I am interested in buying DKNG's shares as I am interested in the emphasis they have on betting on eSports, as well as Fantasy Football and even the results of reality television shows. It's pretty innovative compared to other gambling companies if you ask me. They also have a large market share in the American online gambling industry, along with FanDuel.\n\nI think that as more states begin to legalize online sports gambling, that can only be a good thing for DKNG. I think that their case is also further strengthened by what is happening with COVID-19, as more people will be thinking of staying inside rather than going to casinos.\n\nDKNG's revenues have almost doubled YoY, although they are yet to make a net profit as they are focusing on improving their tech and attaining customers at the moment.  However, I'm not sure how much I should be concerned about this, as their revenues tell the tale that they are providing a good business model for future growth.\n\nAnyway, that's my amateur DD. What do you guys think about DraftKings?\n\nThanks for reading and interested to hear your comments :)\n\nPlease note: [https://i.redd.it/jitkuv3jkav21.png](https://i.redd.it/jitkuv3jkav21.png) (I'm the smaller frog)", "created_utc": 1590574226.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/grh0j7/what_do_you_guys_think_of_investing_in_draftkings/", "is_self": true}
