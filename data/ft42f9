Absolutely no one, other than the employees, will shed a tear if/when they fail. They\u2019re facing dwindling physical game sales, the rise of amazon selling consoles and controllers that delivered to your house, and they had almost 1,000 stores shut down along with their business license suspended in Pennsylvania, which is sad for the eight people that live there (no, not the same eight people as the \u201chalf of a brain cell\u201d people mentioned earlier.)\n\nPlus, while everyone else had stock prices raised, GME went down, and I saw my previous manager, Keith, sneeze into his hand and touch a game box. Fuck you keith, I hope you stub your toe until it gets arthritis.\n\nPositions: 5/15 $3p, and still getting doggystyled by a printer.", "created_utc": 1585761745.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ft42f9/gme_is_about_to_get_hit_hard/", "is_self": true}
