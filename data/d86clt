The S&amp;P 500 futures trade five points, or 0.2%, below fair value.\u00a0\n\nSpecifically, the eurozone's flash September Manufacturing PMI declined to 45.6 from 47.0 in August, and Germany's flash Manufacturing PMI fell to 41.4 from 43.5. A reading below 50.0 denotes a contraction. In turn, growth concerns have contributed to the increased demand for U.S. Treasuries, driving yields lower across the curve.\u00a0\n\nThe 2-yr yield is down four basis points to 1.66%, and the 10-yr yield is down seven basis points to 1.69%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.2% to 98.71. WTI crude is down 0.5%, or $0.30, to $57.79/bbl.\n\nIn U.S. data, key reports this week will include the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for September on Tuesday, New Home Sales for August on Wednesday, and the report for Personal Income and Spending on Friday. The latter report will include the Fed's preferred inflation gauge -- the PCE Price Index.\n\nSeparately, FOMC voting members New York Fed President Williams and St. Louis Fed President Bullard are scheduled to speak at separate events today. Mr. Williams will speak at 9:50 a.m. ET, and Mr. Bullard will speak at 1:00 p.m. ET.\n\nIn U.S. Corporate news:\n\n* **U.S. Steel**\u00a0(X 10.45, -0.36): -3.3%, extending its recent losses after the stock was downgraded to Neutral from Overweight at JPMorgan.\u00a0\n* **The We Company**\u00a0(WE, private): Some WeWork directors and Softbank officials are aiming to push CEO Adam Neumann to step down from the helm, according to\u00a0*The Wall Street Journal*.
