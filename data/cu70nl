Its the Feds job to prop up the stock market, WTF do they think they're doing.\" All hell breaks loose; lemmings head for the cliff/exit. SPY turns red. A few autards whack off to a few tendies while the rest shits their pants.\n\n1b) Feds refuse to drop rates - Market cheers, \"Hey, the economy is doing great so feds didn't need to cut rates afterall. Looks like we bear commentator retards were wrong.\"  SPY turns green. A few autards whack off to a few tendies while the rest shits their pants.\n\n2a) Feds drop rates 1/4 to 1/2 point - Market cheers, \"J Pow in the house, ma nigga knows w'sup.\" SPY turns green. A few autards whack off to a few tendies while the rest shits their pants.\n\n2b) Feds drop rates 1/4 to 1/2 point - \"Shit, recession confirmed.\" Once feds drop rates as response to yield curve inversion, we know shits gonna hit the fan sooner or later. SPY turns red. A few autards...\n\nAll possibilities equally likely so you can be right on the direction of the cuts, but wrong on the direction of the market.
