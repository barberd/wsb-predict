{"id": "fp1ob1", "title": "DD: The day the Fed imploded", "selftext": "TL;DR: US printing way too much money, nobody will want 30 year treasuries at current interest rates, long term treasuries drop 5-10% between 4/8 and 4/9. 4/17 puts on $TLT @ $155-165.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Italian Treasuries**\n\nTake a look at the candlestick plot below for the yield on the Italian 10 year treasury yield. What happened on the March 12 that blew the yield up by 1.5x in a day? The Italian lockdown had started nearly two weeks before.\n\n[Italian Treasury 10 Year Yield](https://preview.redd.it/cr0bg467awo41.png?width=1892&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c9d9688922654083ce050fb9ddb3812be95fe7b)\n\nThe event that precipitated the Italian treasury crisis was the auction of 10 year bonds that occurred on the 12th. No buyers would take on the risk of 10 year bonds at 1.2% yield when it was obvious that the Italian economy was getting buttfucked by a bear and that Italian Fed director, Jeromino Powelazzo, was about to print his way out of a fiscal crisis. The Italians effectively lost control of their monetary policy as interest rates shot up. And when interest rates on new bonds go up, then the value of previous issues tanks. We see that realized as a 9.2% smack down to an ETF that tracks a variety of Italian bonds. Bonds aren't supposed to be volatile, they said...\n\n[Hypothetical \\\\\"growth\\\\\" of $10k in an iShares Italian bond ETF](https://preview.redd.it/b9nywnmuewo41.png?width=1639&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bffff3882f3b58b3f31d99acc4a5b8a10ff839a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What does this mean for the US?**\n\nWith congress set to approve a 2 trillion dollar stimulus bill on top of a 1 trillion dollar deficit already planned for the year, the US will see it's public debt rise from \\~17 trillion to \\~20 trillion this year. That figure depends on the amount of dollars JPow prints and if there is only one coronavirus stimulus (hint: there will be more). The treasury department is going to need to move a lot of paper to cover this ballooning debt and this debt will be riskier if only because the US has more to cover. Even if demand curve for treasuries were constant, the interest rate would have to go up to sell the increased number of treasuries necessary for this level of spending.\n\nDemand will not be the same. Inflation is imminent: JPow will be printing cashmoney depleting the value of the dollar and the global supply shock from shutdowns will result in core inflation as goods, especially consumer goods, cost more. You would have to be AIG 2008 level autistic to buy 30 year treasuries at 1% interest when inflation will likely be 3-5% in the next month.\n\nAdditionally, as other countries scramble for capital to finance their own coronavirus problems, they will not be willing to offer the US their hard-earned tendies. Some [SeekingAlpha bro adds China to the bear case for treasuries](https://seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4333042-bond-market-crash-begins-on-april-8-and-9).\n\n>Imagine you are the People\u2019s Bank of China. You have about $3.1 trillion  \n worth of US Treasuries in your basement. Your economy was stopped cold   \nby the coronavirus. Now, even though you are recovering, your economy is  \n still stopped cold because your biggest trading partner, the one who   \nprovides you with all those dollars in massive trade deficits, is in   \nlockdown. Dollar debts are being called in everywhere. Chinese   \nbusinesses need to draw down dollar reserves. The Chinese banks are   \nrunning low. You need dollars. But all you have are dollar denominated   \nTreasuries, not cash. So you need to sell Treasuries for cash very soon.  \n>  \n>...  \n>  \n>Currency swaps exist so that other central banks don\u2019t have to sell   \ntheir dollar-denominated securities like Treasuries and instead they can  \n swap currency they print (euros, yen, pounds, Swiss francs) out of   \nnothing in exchange for dollars that the Fed prints out of nothing,   \nkeeping interest rates stable in times of turmoil like these. But there   \nare no currency swap lines with the PBOC, the world\u2019s largest foreign   \nholder of US Treasuries. The PBOC is going to start selling if interest   \nrates rise at the next auction rise, and that is going to push interest   \nrates even higher, especially because nobody can afford to lend more   \ndollars to the US government right now by buying its bonds precisely   \nbecause they need every dollar they can get right now.\n\nIt's also possible that the interest rate spike doesn't happen yet. I think it is most likely to occur during the next 30 year auction, but it could be after stimulus bill #2 is announced. Here's the next treasury auction dates to consider: 04/08: 10 Year Note, 04/09: 30 Year Bond, 05/12: 10 Year Note, 05/13: 30 Year Bond, 05/21: 10 Year TIPS. Considering how quickly [JPow fired all of his bullets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjdygx/when_the_fed_steps_in/), I doubt the Fed has fully considered this possibility and that spike will be swift and devastating. The Fed is already showing how little control it has over monetary policy and when the bond apocalypse happens expect all of your puts to print. It will be clear daddy Trump can't save the economy with his money machines.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Alright, retard, you've convinced me enough to blow my allowance. How do I play?**\n\nLevel: Autistic.\n\nBuy puts on $TMF the +3x long term treasury ETF. This is dumb because the volume is not there, but possibly smart if there is crazy volatility during the week before and after the auction as panic sets in to the bond market. Since these leveraged ETFs decay when volatility goes up there are two possible sources of tendies on the put: direct destruction of the underlying bonds and high vol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLevel: New WSBer\n\nBuy puts on $TLT. This is a high volume ETF and you should have no trouble getting puts at a reasonable price. IV is currently at 23% which is a lot better than the $SPY puts you picked up today that are sitting at 70% IV. You could even consider this as a hedge of sorts for your 4/17 $SPY puts: since long bonds and stocks are uncorrelated at least one of the puts should print if you picked non-retarded strike prices. And if the T-Bonds explode in a severe way, both will print. Double tendies. Mega tendies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLevel: Pretend Market Maker\n\nPlay volatility while remaining market neutral. You have more money than my wife's boyfriend gives me in allowance and you can make big plays. Buy a bunch of long-dated calls and puts at the same strike on TLT. Resell them as IV blows through the roof.  There's other ways to do this that are probably smarter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**A Plea**\n\nIf you make money off this DD, I ask that you give 5% profits to your local homeless shelter. If the Fed GUHS here it will be very very bad for the US. Help your fellow man out.
