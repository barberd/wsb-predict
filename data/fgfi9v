{"id": "fgfi9v", "title": "TUP is going UP DD", "selftext": "Tupperware is a household name that's been beaten down over the last few years. The stock was trading over $100 less than 5 years ago, and is currently hovering just above $2. They dropped 60% after having to file for a delay on their earnings. \n\nThey have a healthy balance sheet and a P/E of 1.25. Compared to Zoom's P/E of 3000\nSome debt covenants are looming to be due at the end of the month, and could be one the reasons why the delay on their earnings. \nIt's a take over candidate, Newell or P&G are two names that come to mine.\nDrop in oil means a decrease in the costs for making plastics.\nPlastics are one of the COVID plays, as US has become far too reliant on cheap chinese plastics, whereas TUP has several manufacturers in the US. Once again, a buy out target for companies with Chinese supply chain issues\n\nThey recently did a rebrand of their site and did a pop up in NYC in December trying to target the hipster demographic that has eluded them the past decade. \n\nBut it's not just storage containers that they make but also have diversified into beauty and personal care products.\nhttps://www.tupperwarebrands.com/company/brands\n\nAs the virus spreads, far less people will be eating out. Plastics and food containers are the play here. \n\nTL;DR $5C April 17 only .05 cents\nConsider also some longer term Calls which are also cheap.\n\nPersonally, I'm making this an earnings play, so i'm jacked to the tits on March and April calls. Hoping for good guidance numbers or potential sale exploration. Easily worth over $10 in terms of a sale.", "created_utc": 1583853932.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fgfi9v/tup_is_going_up_dd/", "is_self": true}
