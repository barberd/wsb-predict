A question was asked where they think sp500 will close EOY and the about half of the serious answers seems to be above 2800, with a chunk of them being well beyond 3000.  These are long term investors who max out their 401k, Roth. IRAs, and survive on beans and rice in the hopes of retiring early. Basically these people believe there will be no lasting effects of the entire world shutting down for months and potentially millions dying. I'm not saying we're ending the year sub 1500 of anything but to think we'll be back at ATH territory means there are really people out there that think the recession is cancelled. Yes, my puts are hurting and my expire worthless. Yes, I am an autist. But how can this many people be oblivious to the impact this is going to have in the world??\n\nOn a related note, where do you retards realistically see the market closing EOY.", "created_utc": 1586290473.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fwrrlx/for_those_of_you_that_refuse_to_believe_there_are/", "is_self": true}
