Now I'm about to move back to my parents.\n\nSince I'm filing for bankruptcy anyway I thought of just trying out RH anyway. Since I got nothing more to lose I just wanted to ask how to leverage the fuck out of Robinhood (as much as possible). Can there be any legal consequences for me beside bankruptcy? \n\nAlso I think that I'm a good investor, I knew of many firms before they actually boomed, so j just need access to capital and then I'm going to make a good return anyway.", "created_utc": 1576214391, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e9znzr/exploit_for_highest_leverage_filing_for/", "is_self": true}
