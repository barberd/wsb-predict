{"id": "g9za2w", "title": "Activision: Still A Lot More Room to Get Some Sweet Tendies", "selftext": "As the title suggests, Activision still has a lot of room to grow and surpass all-time highs. I'm going to try to make this relatively short so you autists can digest this.\n\n**Business Model**\n\nActivision was built to thrive in this pandemic; a majority of their revenue comes from in-game purchases. I think a common thing people do is make an apple to oranges comparison between gaming and streaming/subscription platforms like Netflix, but this isn't exactly accurate. With increased traffic, Activision actually stands to profit more and increase their revenues due to the nature of their business model. On top of that, COD was the best-selling game in 2020 and second-best in March after Animal Crossing, and COD Mobile has also picked up some serious momentum recently from the pandemic.\n\nHere's a link to an article where the results of findings on increases in gaming time and in-game purchases are found: [https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/24/activision-will-get-boost-from-record-game-sales.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/24/activision-will-get-boost-from-record-game-sales.aspx)\n\n**Bullish Signs from Management**\n\nThis is going to sound like a silly reason, but I found this to be a good sign from management. Recently, the CEO got a lot of press attention for giving all 10,000 employees his personal phone number. Unless you're a true autist, you don't hand out your personal phone number to your employees if your company is doing poorly or you are about to layoff a bunch of people. Also, Activision is hiring a ton which is always a good sign when we are seeing all these other companies having layoffs.\n\n**More Games in the Pipeline**\n\nActivision is adding to its mobile pipeline this year and planning to release Overwatch 2 and Diablo 4 in the future. On top of that, the COD franchise is stronger than ever (it is returning to its old glory). This bodes well for Activision going forward and will definitely show up in their upcoming earnings on May 5.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nEarnings next week will be a catalyst for it to test its all-time highs, and after boomers realize opening the economy means they can't go to their local Applebee's to sit down with their boomer friends and get drinks, they will want to invest in \"the thing all those young folks do.\" Also, this thesis holds true for EA and take-two as well who make a majority of their money as well from in-game purchases (granted less than Activision percentage wise) but you might run into liquidity traps/wide spreads. I would stick with Activision and Zynga (due to its increase in traffic to Facebook).\n\ntldr: more traffic, means more revenue for Activision which means hitting ATH\n\nATVI 06/19 $80C\n\nZNGA 06/19 $8C\n\nJD 06/19 $50C", "created_utc": 1588120262.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9za2w/activision_still_a_lot_more_room_to_get_some/", "is_self": true}
