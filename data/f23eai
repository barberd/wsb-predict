Don't get me wrong, I love MSFT, but you wouldn't buy MSFT puts would you? Right, which is exactly why you'd do the next best thing -- buy AAPL. \n\nBUT WAIT\n\nWhy buy AAPL? They have dozens of business sectors bleeding their wallet and rely on iPhone and MacBook sales to pump up their numbers. Hmm.. now if only there were a company that releases the most used software on AAPL in a market they are so entrenched in that literally no one can topple them. They would have to be so widely used that they get literal passive marketing from everyone online because there aren't any other tools to use other than theirs.\n\nAnd they would have to be so pervasive that even your 10-year old nephew knows their products, but doesn't quite know their name.\n\nIt's a new era. Boomers are dying. The only big bois left will be those that pervade the infrastructure of the masses and those that create that infrastructure.\n\nThis is the MSFT and ADBE era\n\nDon't get left behind\n(If you doubt me, take 1 look at their charts and 1 look at MSFT and go short it)", "created_utc": 1581396867, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f23eai/you_havent_heard_of_adobe/", "is_self": true}
