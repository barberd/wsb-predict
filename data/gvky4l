Here comes my next play with a similar amount of heads up, ORCL. Lets see if we can beat the previous gains (CLDR is going to be tough to beat honestly that was huge).   \n\n\n**TL;DR** \\- Oracle(ORCL) has earning coming up on 6/17 (After Market). ORCL is yet another! cloud company that also provides database software solutions. As all of our previous plays they are benefiting even more from the current situation. Further multiplied by multiple companies looking to invest in more cloud infrastructure, remote engineers and so forth. Huge potential to rocket up in the next few weeks. Plays - **ORCL $55c & $60c 7/17**\n\n**What is Oracle?**  \nOracle is in the big leagues with the likes of Microsoft, leading the cloud and database space. Oracle Corporation provides products and services that address enterprise information technology environments worldwide including cloud, software as a service and data base tech. They are investing heavily and maybe even leading the autonomous database through AI which is growing more critical every day to to the exponential amount of data needed to be stored, analyzed and used.   \n\n\n**Financials** \n\n* The company generated around $40 billion in revenue and over $10 billion in earnings every quarter (27% profit margin) for the past year. It's also met or beaten analyst expectations for EPS over the same time period. \n* Oracle's revenue stability comes from its cloud computing and licensing services, which account for over 70% of company revenue.  \n* Strong and stable dividends.\n* Short Term and Long Term Liabilities - ORCL short term assets of $33.4b exceed short term liabilities of $15.74b significantly.   \n\n\n**Play**\n\nORCL $55c & $60c 7/17\n\nI am also thinking about getting in on the same positions for 6/19.\n\n**What are your thoughts?**", "created_utc": 1591149839.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gvky4l/heads_up_on_orcl_discussion/", "is_self": true}
