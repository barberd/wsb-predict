{"id": "d39s9m", "title": "Morning Briefing (9/12/2019)", "selftext": "# ECB cuts rates; President Trump delays Oct. 1 tariff rate increase for two weeks\n\nU.S. futures are up but are well off their highs that followed President Trump's announcement that he will delay the tariff rate increase on $250 billion of Chinese imports by two weeks. Currently, the S&amp;P 500 futures trade ten points, or 0.3%, above fair value after trading as high as 0.9% soon after the news.\n\nThose goods are currently taxed at 25% and will now increase to 30% on Oct. 15 instead of Oct. 1, which would have coincided with the 70th anniversary of the\u00a0People's Republic of China. President Trump said his decision was a gesture of goodwill at the request of China's Vice Premier Liu He in front of the anniversary. China exempted certain U.S. products from a higher tariff rate yesterday.\n\nFutures have recently ticked higher in the wake of the ECB's policy decision. The central bank lowered its deposit rate by ten basis points to -0.50% as expected. In addition, the ECB said net purchases of EUR 20 bln will be restarted in November and will end shortly before the bank begins to raise key interest rates.\u00a0\n\nOn the data front, investors will receive the Consumer Price Index for August (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) and the weekly Initial Claims (Briefing.com consensus 218,000) and Continuing Claims report at 8:30 a.m. ET. The Treasury Budget for August will be released at 2:00 p.m. ET.\u00a0\n\nU.S. Treasuries are slightly higher following the ECB decision. The 2-yr yield is down three basis points to 1.64%, and the 10-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.71%. The U.S. Dollar Index is up 0.1% to 98.71. WTI crude ($55.22, -0.53, -1.0%) extends its losses from yesterday after Saudi Arabia said OPEC+ will not consider deeper production cuts until its next meeting in December.\u00a0\n\n* **Oracle**\u00a0(ORCL 55.23, -1.06): -1.9% after guiding Q2 EPS slightly below expectations and announcing CEO Mark Hurd will take a leave of absence for health reasons. Oracle also added $15 billion to its share buyback program.\u00a0\n* **Baker Hughes, a GE Company** (BHGE 21.80, -0.49): -2.2% after **General Electric** (GE 9.33, -0.03, -0.3%) said it plans to reduce its stake in the company to 38.4% from 50.4%, raising$2.7 billion in the process, according to\u00a0*Reuters*.\n\nReviewing overnight developments:\n\n* Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region ended Thursday on a mixed note.\u00a0Japan's Nikkei +0.8%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng -0.3%, China's Shanghai Composite +0.8%, India's Sensex -0.5%, South Korea's Kospi Closed for Full Moon Festival, Australia's ASX All Ordinaries +0.2%.\n   * In economic data:\n      * China's August FDI 6.9% ytd (last 7.3%)\n      * Japan's July Core Machinery Orders -6.6% m/m (expected -9.0%; last 13.9%); +0.3% yr/yr (expected -4.5%; last 12.5%).
