{"id": "hcik1q", "title": "Weird price movement correlations w/ options", "selftext": "I trade Bank of America options mostly. Today there was way more volume towards BAC calls side than the puts and the stock itself was trending down until around 2 pm. Then from 2-4pm almost the entire banking sector basically reversed and all trended up the rest of the day to close. \n\nI watch a few other banking stocks at the same time and found that my BAC $26, 6/26 Call price was barely moving from .32 while Citigroup\u2019s call options were moving relatively fast in reflecting changes in the price of its stock. So I sold the BAC call.\n\nI bought C $53, 6/26 Call option at 2:24pm for 1.28 and then sold it at 3:16 for 1.51. That is almost an 18% rise. During the same period of time the BAC $26, 6/26 Call only went from like .32~.36 or about a 10% rise. I mean the thing I\u2019m confused about is that the BAC option vs. the Citigroup Option only rose about half( ~10% vs. ~20% ).\n\nWhy did the BAC call option only rise about half the percent that the C option rose in the same time frames from ~2-3:30? There wasn\u2019t any real difference in either stock price rising in the same time frame. \n\nOn another note the $26 BAC call option had volume of around 5,000 by 2pm while the C call option only had only maybe 300. \n\nIts really confusing me why the BAC call didn\u2019t rise nearly as much percentage as the C call option.
