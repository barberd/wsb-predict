{"id": "gud3iv", "title": "Questions on the Passive Investing Bubble", "selftext": "Passive Investment Bubble has been in the back of my head since hearing MB talk about it and I want to know if I'm crazy for seeing stuff like below and thinking it makes sense..\n\n How do index funds actually work.. like what path does the money take??  (not talking about ETFs here)\n\n\\-I buy shares of an index fund during market hours (9:30am to 4pm) on Monday\n\nsay FXAIX or VFINX as (track the S&P 500)\n\n\\-I have effectively just handed over say $1,000 of my money to a fund manager and said I want however many shares this buys me\n\n\\-Monday after the close (after 4pm) the NAV of FXAIX is calculated by the fund manager (which should match the change in the S&P 500 that day)\n\n\\-Now what happened to my $1,000 ??\n\ndoes the guy buy $1,000 worth of the actual companies in the S&P 500 index Monday evening??\n\nDoes this happen after hours or pre-market??\n\nDoes all money designated for index funds *NOT* trade during regular market hours??\n\nIf so is it safe to say the passive investing bubble began in 1997 (see chart) in article below..??  \n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-approach-has-been-a-slam-dunk-for-stock-market-profits-now-that-its-broken-a-new-trend-has-emerged-2020-05-27?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-approach-has-been-a-slam-dunk-for-stock-market-profits-now-that-its-broken-a-new-trend-has-emerged-2020-05-27?mod=home-page)\n\nCuriously.. 1998 is also called out in this article [https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1fg0jnvbpc536/History-Made-U-S-Passive-AUM-Matches-Active-For-First-Time](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1fg0jnvbpc536/History-Made-U-S-Passive-AUM-Matches-Active-For-First-Time) \n\n\"At the end of 1998, the amount investors held in active U.S. stock funds was 6.5 times that in index funds. Two years later, with the launch of Barclays Global Investors\u2019 iShares exchange-traded funds, passive started chipping away at the dominance of active managers. But even then, the amount held in active funds was still 5 times that of index funds.\" \n\n\"Assets in passive domestic stock funds have grown to $4.3 trillion, the same amount held by active managers, as of the end of last month.\"   (April 2019)\n\nThoughts??", "created_utc": 1590982189.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gud3iv/questions_on_the_passive_investing_bubble/", "is_self": true}
