If I put down 2k on an option im expecting to make 500$ + and wont sell till then.\n\nMy first option was AMD a few weeks ago and I went all in and made 400% that same day, I could have made more if I pulled out but I just kept seeing it go up so much and got used to it. Fucked me up forever now. Never satstified.\n\nAnyone else like this? Hard to walk away when you get a taste of how much you could make .\n\nFor example today  [https://gyazo.com/6c82354fda51aab2eeebc5adc685bd66](https://gyazo.com/6c82354fda51aab2eeebc5adc685bd66)  and I still didnt sell.
