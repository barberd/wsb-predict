Their earnings call was coming up and I did some digging through the 10k and news reports. This company has been flat for ages, they have manufacturing based out of the midwest/north east states (pretty fucked due to covid), Spain (fucked), and Ontario (Province taking a fairly hardline stance on being closed so also pretty fucked). \n\nThen I thought, who the fuck in their right mind is still eating Tootsie rolls? So I did some analysis on their big brands, I have NEVER heard of half of their candies and the only ones worth mentioning are Junior Mints (which are pretty dope). Turns out they sell a good portion of their Junior Mint candies through movie theaters (fucked), and the vast majority of their yearly sales comes from Halloween (probably the holiday that is the most antonymous with social distancing). \n\nTheir cash/balance sheet seems fine so they will likely weather the storm BUT, you have a flat/declining company with productions that are mostly fucked due to Covid and their biggest sales event of the year likely going to take a big hit.... so HOW THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT TRADING ABOVE WHAT IT WAS IN JAN???? This motherfucker rallied all through the dip in Feb/Mar. \n\nThen it dawned on me.... I haven't checked out of fear but I am 100% certain that 95% of their shareholders are old fucks who have owned the stock since 1995, those fucks will NEVER sell. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have TR 35p 5/15 but god damn am I regretting this. Anyone else looked into this?
