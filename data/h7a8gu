This indicates that institutions are hedging their longs with puts. (This is an assumption.  As noted in the comments, VIX is comprised of all option buying activity: volatility goes up when options are in demand, which means they are being purchased.  Institutions are typically long stocks and purchase puts against their longs as insurance/hedge)\n\nDIX is up slightly from yesterday, still above 45%.  This indicates that buying activity didn\u2019t go down.  Pretty flat.\n\nGEX tanked, which indicates that volatility is expected to be higher, because low GEX means more put buying, instead of call selling against longs.\n\nThis tells me that institutions have no idea what\u2019s gonna happen, but they\u2019re preparing for something big.  If this was just a dip in their eyes, VIX wouldn\u2019t have shot up so high, and GEX wouldn\u2019t be so low.\n\nIt looks like this comes down to whether the new retail traders who bought in with stimulus checks are going to continue panic selling.  They were responsible for most of the rally, and they will be responsible for the selloff.  They are unpredictable.\n\nIf you think retail has paper hands, buy puts.\n\nIf you think retail has diamond hands, it\u2019s a great call buying opportunity.\n\nThoughts?\n\nEDIT:\nThere seems to be some misunderstanding of how prices move.  We all know retail does not account for large portion of the money in the market.  What causes prices to *move* is activity of market takers.  If tons of sell orders come in all at once, it will move the price significantly downward, because the bids will continually be filled lower and lower and lower.  Institutions tend to add liquidity and not place market orders, so they aren\u2019t contributing to activity as much.  In fact, many of them are in dark pools so that they don\u2019t contribute to the movement at all.  As an example of how a rather insignificant amount of money compared to the total market can move it greatly - a few billion of dollars were pumped into the market in april with market orders, and just a few billion USD at once pumped SPY excessively.", "created_utc": 1591921656.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h7a8gu/vix_dix_gex_611/", "is_self": true}
