{"id": "dz5fpa", "title": "PTON DD, not the fake shit", "selftext": "For those of you that are too focused on bitch mommy and when your nuggies are getting out of the oven or how you can cover up the stench of your pissy jugs, im about to change your life. PTON, or Peloton for those of you that cant stop playing Fortnite long enough to operate a finance site, is a company that sells stationary bikes that play musack. What many people dont know, and this is true, is that when the bike first came out, they sold them for 800 US dollars. They had very shitty sales. The CEO, who is an absolute genious (very smart fellow), decided, fuck it, these wealthy whores only like spendy stuff, lets double that shit to 1600. Guess what? Sales went to Mars. So, whats on tap for this POS stonk? My guess, they say fuck it again and move the price for these coat hangers up to 5 grand. Problem solved. Lets face it, Chad's wife is willing to spend 5 grand on a purse barely big enough to hold a pack of my smokes. If her friends come over for wine at 10am and dont see a bike \"to work out on\" , her status is in question. Long PTON and whoever owns the Bravo channel", "created_utc": 1574271793, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dz5fpa/pton_dd_not_the_fake_shit/", "is_self": true}
