We see people turning $5k into $50k or more. We also see people losing every last dime. And it's certainly entertaining to viewers on the outside. But I thinks it important for us to get a true understanding of what is going on in the minds of people on this sub who make such huge bets. People are putting their livelihoods at risk and sometimes even taking their own lives. And it might be important to ask...\n\nWhat are you trying to accomplish? At what point do you stop, if ever?  What is your end goal?
