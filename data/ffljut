I tried day trading but i lost about 2k from TSLA, so i switched over to calls/puts and have been going through this sub the past week. I need your intelligent minds to help me spread out my money on different companies. I have almost 9k, 10k if i do RH instant deposit. Im not asking you to do my hw for me but i am asking for assistance. Based on what ive read this weekend, these are the plays that makes sense to me\n\n\t\t   Strike              Qty\t  Price    Total\n**DKS**     $40 Call 3/13     20     0.30     600\n**XOM**     $40 Put 3/13     20     0.35     700\n**RDSA**    $40 Put 3/13     10     0.90     900\n**XOP**        $8 Put 3/13   200     0.02     400\n**MRO**       $5 Put 3/13   100     0.06     600\n**CCL**     $25 Put 3/13    10     1.05    1050\n**WYNN**  $91 Put 3/13      5      3.95   1975\n**HTZ**     $7.5 Put 3/13     20    0.45     900\n**DG**   $182.5 Call 3/20    10    0.50     500\n**SJM**    $115 Call 3/20    10    1.20    1200\n**UBER**   $28 Put 3/20     10    0.73     730\n**EWI**     $26 Call 3/20      5    1.15     575\n**WTI**     $2 Put 3/20       20    0.20     400\n**CAR**     $19 Put 3/20     10    0.80     800\n**VAL**     $1 Put 3/20     100    0.05      500\n**DO**\t$1 Put 3/20     100    0.05      500\n**RIG**\t$1 Put 3/20     100    0.03      300\n**XOP**\t$8 Put 3/20\t\t\t0\n**RUN**\t$24 Call 3/20    50    0.15      750\n**RUN**\t$25 Call 3/20  100    0.10     1000\n**DIS**\t$100 Put 3/20    5    1.19       595\n**ABBV** $92 Call 3/20    5    1.43       715\n**INO**\t$6 Put 3/20      10    0.45      450\n**AAL**\t$10 Put 4/3      10    0.63      630\n**INDA** $29.5 Put 4/9   10    0.75      750\n**GIS**\t$60 Call 4/17     10   0.71      710\n**INDA** $27 Put 4/24     20   0.40      800\n**PK**    $12.5 Put 4/17   10     0.45    450\n**UVXY**     $15 Put 4/24\t10\t0.74\t740\n**SBUX**  $67.5 Put 5/15  5\t2.44\t1220\n**LVS**     $40 Put 5/15    5\t1.78\t890\n**LH**     $220 Call 5/15   5\t1.8\t900\n**LVS**     $40 Put 6/19    5\t2.43\t1215\n**GIS**     $65 Call 7/17   20\t0.46\t920\n**F**            $5 Put 9/18  20\t0.36\t720\n**PG**     $140 Call 1/15   5\t3.2\t1600\n\t\t\tTotal\t27685\n\nTotal is 27k, so that wont work. I was thinking of just sticking to 10 companies and hold off on long term ones like F, LVS and PG. I think these would be my choices:\n\n**DKS** $40 Call 3/13, **XOM** $40 Put 3/13, **XOP** $8 Put 3/13, **MRO** $5 Put 3/13, **CCL** $25 Put 3/13, **WTI** $2 Put 3/20, **CAR** $19 Put 3/20, **RUN** $25 Call 3/20, **INO** $6 Put 3/20, **AAL** $10 Put 4/3, **INDA** $29.5 Put 4/9, **GIS** $60 Call 4/17, **INDA** $27 Put 4/24\n\nCan you experts chime in please? Should i stick to oil puts instead?", "created_utc": 1583711350, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffljut/callput_review_before_i_loose_money/", "is_self": true}
