{"id": "e7hu24", "title": "PTI, could be a long term 10-20 bagger easily", "selftext": "Sharing some DD for a potential major jump on PTI coming up literally next few days (data can drop any day now)  \n\n\nPTI works on CF and has recently come up as a competitor to Vertex, a 57B dollar company that recently had Trikafta approved, a triplet (three drug combination) solution for CF patients which has shown a 10% and 14% effectiveness for homozygous/heterozygous patients in general.  \n\n\nVertex is projected to have around 4B in revenues in several years as it corners the market for CF drugs  \n\n\nIssue is, their pricing is very high meaning almost all of Europe is unable to have access to the drug, and there are requirements for effectiveness (certain gene markers or mutations present) which determine if you're even eligible to benefit.  \n\n\nIn comes PTI, a small 180M market cap biotech that has been working on competing solutions, with a stated mission to increase access to affordable solutions for CF patients. The company has published results previously which showed an effectiveness of 8% from a doublet (two drug combination) which is already rather close to Vertex's triplet solution. Additionally they presented recently at Piper Jaffray Healthcare Conference where the CEO almost giddily spoke about the results and recent efforts they have to commercialize the doublet. The important part goes back to the fact that the european market has no solution available like Vertex' Trikafta triplet due to affordability, and is desperate for solutions for their CF population (Jeremy Corbyn literally posted/tweeted about this recently). The doublet, even today is best in class with at least twice the effectiveness of other doublets available. Europe is \"beseeching\" them to come their ASAP and they are already working with a team to fast track this to be commercialized in the european market. Doublets AIUI are traditionally also easier to get approved because less drug combinations.   \n\n\nThey are about to release phase 2 results from their doublet and triplet formulations which show data from an extra two weeks. Previous results were from 14 day treatments AIUI, and their competitors results have to date been based off of 28 day trials (though there is a bit of a plateau effect associated with these sorts of drugs AIUI so typically 14 day vs 28 day doesn't see a significant jump in efficacy).   \n\n\nPTI however has been adjusting their approach because last time they presented the results in March it wasn't exactly how Vertex had done the trial and hence wasn't well received, so the stock dropped. This time it's in line with how Vertex had done their studies. \n\n[http://ir.proteostasis.com/news-releases/upcoming-events](http://ir.proteostasis.com/news-releases/upcoming-events) listen to the webcast  \n\n\nhere's what is priced in  \n\n\nWhen the news that trial data would drop in Q4 2019 vs 2020 Q1 dropped, it ran up a bit to the 2.50 range and floundered there  \n\n\nWhen the CEO spoke during the conference about the doublet and the huge potential, as well as dropping the news that data will drop in next few days (that was Thursday) it ran up even further spiking to 4.20 before settling around 3.50  \n\n\nThere's two main things we need to see in the data  \n\n\n1. Does the doublet at 28 days exceed the triplet performance from Vertex? \n   1. If it even matches it, GG game over, Vertex is fucked since hands down a doublet is better than a triplet from a quality of life POV and this has wider potential for adoption\n   2. If it doesn't but is higher than the previous 8%, or still shows 8%, then we're in a great set up still for long run\n2. Does the triplet match or exceed Vertex triplet performance?\n   1. If it matches or exceeds it, also GG for Vertex since this company's drug is a serious threat to their entire business\n   2. If it doesn't match or exceed it then we could see this stock tumble in short term and shorts could force it down back to 2$ range in my opinion\n\nIn any event, either the doublet or triplet must exceed the vertex triplet performance for guaranteed mooning.  \n\n\nOn the other hand, if doublet gets close, I'll back the truck up and load up if this drops, because it's gonna be a gold mine just based on doublet alone   \n\n\nLong term potential, they can corner the European market without even needing to compete with Vertex because they aren't even offered there. If they go this route which CEO already indicated is full swing ahead, this thing has much less political fighting to deal with. If they go the triplet route (unlikely to be prioritized first in my opinion), then Vertex will likely play dirty or try a hostile takeover to kill the drug and maintain monopoly pricing power\n\nBuyout potential in my opinion is high but unclear when and whether the company would sell as their mission is to offer CF patients more options and improve their lives. They definitely wouldn't sell to Vertex in my opinion, but they may not sell to others if they don't have ability to go head to head against Vertex  \n\n\nIn comes Abbvie, this company has recently positioned more investment into CF and last year bought an asset from Galapagos for about 250M$ (note this was literally a failed phase 2 trial asset) just to be able to learn about potential solutions to solve CF  \n\n\nThey recently have made more and more signals indicating a desire to get into CF (likely due to the huge market potential for commercialization)\n\n [https://news.abbvie.com/news/press-releases/news-type/corporate-news/abbvie-announces-collaboration-with-cystic-fibrosis-foundation.htm](https://news.abbvie.com/news/press-releases/news-type/corporate-news/abbvie-announces-collaboration-with-cystic-fibrosis-foundation.htm) \n\nI could see Abbvie go for PTI as a buyout long term if doublet shows good adoption and/or either doublet or triplet exceed Vertex performance.  \n\n\nNow what are the chances the data is good in the upcoming days?  \n\n\nFor one thing, despite their shares and stock appreciating recently, PTI has not made any offerings or raised cash (a rational choice if you think data will cause shares to tumble). The CEO seemed pretty positive when speaking about results and excited about their potential future at the webcast, and on top of that, the delta between PTI doublet and Vertex triplet is only 2% for homozygous patients at the moment (8% vs placebo vs a 10% vs placebo)  \n\n\nThis stock could easily soar to be worth 100$ in the long run (3-5 years), Vertex is a 57B$ company, at 220$ PPS, PTI if they have best in class doublet or best in class drug can garner at the least 1B in revenue long term given Vertex with a non European focus is projecting 4B by 2023 in revenue  \n\n\nPTI today is 178M at 3.50, this thing is easily worth 1-2B in next year in my opinion  \n\n\nYou can go for some short term calls if you want, though calls aimed for 2020 are likely safer  \n\n\nI'm riding $15k in shares in my 401k, $10k in shares in my brokerage account, $3-5k in a mix of December and long term calls.  \n\n\nI fully expect to see this company blow it out of the water long term, so I'm fine if my short term december calls die and I take some losses, I'll load up and buy more and wait it out (probably first time I'll ever have long term capital gains lol)  \n\n\nFeedback comments welcome, this shit was way too long a write up  \n\n\nTl;dr data drop any day, can be major positive squeeze, there is a huge short volume on this stock that can force it to spike up, if it spikes up I recommend selling 30-40% for inevitable pull back and then loading up more", "created_utc": 1575743274, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e7hu24/pti_could_be_a_long_term_1020_bagger_easily/", "is_self": true}
