Do you seriously think any court will accept them closing down their services for an ENTIRE TRADING DAY?\n\nBest case scenario is that they're too incompetent to show up, so you get a default judgement and the judge gives you your missing tendies.\n\nWorst case scenario, they send a lawyer up there, and you have to argue your case. But this still fucks Robinhood over, because they're spending money on lawyers. If we all do this, we can easily bankrupt the company.\n\nTL;DR: sue RH in small claims court, get tendies or bankrupt RH.", "created_utc": 1583247417, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcvpu1/sue_robinhood_in_small_claims_court_if_your_loss/", "is_self": true}
