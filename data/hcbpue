{"id": "hcbpue", "title": "Merrill Lynch Financial Advisor Call", "selftext": "I got an unprompted call from ML today asking if I would give them a few minutes to discuss my financial planning as many colleagues at my company have decided to use them for financial planning. They asked where I get my current financial advise and I told them all about the sweet tendies I made from WSB and how I just sold all of my IVV and FXAIX that I\u2019ve held long term to buy as much TVIX as I could.\n\nThat being said, I accepted their call. Any last minute advice to blow their mind with?", "created_utc": 1592610713.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hcbpue/merrill_lynch_financial_advisor_call/", "is_self": true}
