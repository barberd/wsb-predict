{"id": "fy2dbi", "title": "Let's take another look at Movie Theaters - Heavy Fundamental Analysis/DD Inside", "selftext": "TL;DR at bottom \n\nHere's some fundamental analysis for you folks.\n\nEPR Properties (NYSE: EPR) is a REIT that owns 'experiential' real estate. Basically their entire portfolio is comprised of theaters, theme parks, water parks, and other entertainment venues like TopGolf, etc.\n\nBasically all of the sectors that are just teeming with people these days & the foreseeable future. Yup..\n\nTheir largest tenant is AMC theaters, who contributes to a whopping \\~20% of their total rental revenues. Their exposure to the Theater industry as a whole is a crazy \\~45% of rental revenues.\n\nLet's stay on AMC for a bit. Today, more research analysts & articles came out pointing towards imminent bankruptcy @ AMC \\[1\\]. Their stock traded down -22% today. AMC has also publicly communicated that they have not paid rent for April \\[2\\]. I won't go too deep here, but some numbers for AMC:\n\n\\- Net leverage is 6x (very high), on 14% margins.\n\n\\- Last year they churned out $6.5Bn in revenues and only had free cash flow (after servicing debt, etc.) of \\~$60 million.\n\nYes, FCF margins were a paltry 1%. Even if you add back their discretionary capital expenditures, it takes the margins up to 9%. Assuming revenues are consistent throughout the year, they can't even afford to take 1 month of 0 revenues, but they aren't consistent. Summer is the busiest/most lucrative time of year for them, and it aint' happening.\n\nThe theater business has 0 brand loyalty, there are no real barriers to entry here. You go to the theater with the smallest path of resistance.\n\nBack to EPR. EPR's other tenants are Regal (#2 tenant, 12% of revenues), Cinemark (6% of revenues), and a whole assortment of similar tenants. Their total exposure to the Theater industry is 45% of their total rental revenues \\[3\\].\n\nSo - why the fuck did EPR trade up +12.5% today & why is it up +26% in the last week?\n\nLet's tackle the main argument justifying this - the stock was oversold (still down -67% over last year).\n\nFirst off, for people who do not know the REIT industry, especially the triple-net space, here's a crash course on how they're valued. Price is literally driven by 2 themes: Interest rates (dividend yield spread to bonds) and M&A.\n\nFor Triple Net REITs specifically, the valuation is literally entirely driven by M&A. Why? M&A leads to more rental revenue, which drives increases in dividend which ripple outwards. For those who want to do more reading, you can read about Price to NAV premiums that was prevalent in the space. In a nutshell, this means that the implied valuation of the Company based on its stock price exceeded the valuation implied by pricing in the commercial real estate space for their portfolio based on speculation that M&A through the year will take them up to the appropriate NAV.\n\nSo, I think it's safe to say there's no M&A in the near to medium term. I won't peg a % value on this, but for all the folks that say 'ok revenue is going to be down \\~45% (assuming just the theaters are not paying rent), why is the stock down more than this?', hopefully this is a good direction why.\n\nLet's look at some numbers.\n\nEPR had free cash flow of \\~$400mm last year, adding back their interest expense, total cash flow to service debt, etc. of \\~$550mm.\n\nInterest expense on debt: \\~$140mm/year\n\nDividends on preferred shares: \\~$15mm/year\n\nSo free cash flow can drop by 72% and they're still solvent right? Wait. This is a REIT we're talking about. They *have* to pay dividends. Their stock is based on speculation on increasing their dividend. **EPR is a monthly dividend payer.**\n\nThey raised their dividend in 4Q'19. **Their dividend/year obligation is now a \\~$370mm expense per year.**\n\nTo sustain their current dividend, they can only afford to lose \\~**4%** of cash flow in addition to servicing their debt & preferred dividends. They banked on M&A, etc. to increase/sustain this level through 2020. Pre-corona, management was talking about venturing into the casino REIT business. None of this is happening now.\n\nBack to shit autists will understand. The upcoming news slate for them looks more grim than promising.\n\nEarnings are on 4/28, they announced their April dividend last year on 4/17, so I expect similar timing this year, all of which will look more grim.\n\nThis Company will look to cut its dividend based on my math. Even if they sustain it, it will be a leveraged dividend payout which I believe will not be received well especially if more news on the AMC fiasco pans out to the downside further. As a side note, in my personal professional experience, the first thing thrown out / adjusted in any restructuring are the leases.\n\nAnother potential catalyst is a move in their credit rating. They are a BBB- Company, which is on the cusp of investment grade. If their main tenant goes bankrupt, how does this bode for their rating? One notch downgrade is in the junk/HY territory. What are the implications to its equity if this is the case?\n\nLastly - I've spent my free time during this quarantine primarily watching shows & movies on Netflix. The last place I want to go to once this quarantine is over is to a movie theater to watch another fucking movie.\n\n**EPR 5/15P Any strike price below $20**\n\n\\[1\\] [https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/amc-theatres-bankruptcy-appears-analyst-says-1289514](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/amc-theatres-bankruptcy-appears-analyst-says-1289514)\n\n\\[2\\] [https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/08/amc-tells-its-landlords-were-not-paying-rent-anymo.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/08/amc-tells-its-landlords-were-not-paying-rent-anymo.aspx)\n\n\\[3\\] [http://investors.eprkc.com/Cache/IRCache/8bb277bd-1b8d-f52d-cec7-7bdced7e9d0c.PDF?O=PDF&T=&Y=&D=&FID=8bb277bd-1b8d-f52d-cec7-7bdced7e9d0c&iid=113645](http://investors.eprkc.com/Cache/IRCache/8bb277bd-1b8d-f52d-cec7-7bdced7e9d0c.PDF?O=PDF&T=&Y=&D=&FID=8bb277bd-1b8d-f52d-cec7-7bdced7e9d0c&iid=113645)", "created_utc": 1586472161.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fy2dbi/lets_take_another_look_at_movie_theaters_heavy/", "is_self": true}
