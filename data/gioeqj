Google search companies. Good ones are cloud companies but people don't realize there are subsets of cloud companies. Find those companies and look at their earnings and play those earnings for a 90% of making profit... Stop buying the week of earnings and instead buy 2-4 weeks before earnings.. I know its hard holding the options but the wait is always worth it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you wanna play stocks like TSLA AMZN etc then thats ok but best chance if you do it with lots of $$ avaliable and you would have to daytrade and actually know you shit because its legit more of a gamble then anything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMade a thread last week of a few with people commenting a few. Pretty much all of them went up since post and many have upcoming earnings aswell.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfjdab/cloud\\_service\\_tech\\_talks\\_with\\_upcoming\\_earnings/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfjdab/cloud_service_tech_talks_with_upcoming_earnings/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you see a company being talked about nonstop in daily threads there is a 90% chance that you shouldn't follow.
