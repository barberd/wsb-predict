The pic the next day showed 2,140 put contracts owned (options on 214,000 shares) at 28.62 cents\n\n**Feb 21, 2020  ACCOUNT = $84,000**\n\n[https://twitter.com/glipsman/status/1230896559757262848](https://twitter.com/glipsman/status/1230896559757262848)\n\nshows 2,140 SPY PUTs (no expiration shown but comment says they were $200 June PUTS) with cost basis of $0.2862, market value $81,320 (see replies)\n\nhad 70K in GLD and 58K in ZM (and had shorts so you can't just add it all up)\n\n**Mar 18, 2020  ACCOUNT = $6,532,169**\n\n[https://twitter.com/DanielleFong/status/1240301853688107008](https://twitter.com/DanielleFong/status/1240301853688107008)\n\nshows purchases of 430 June 30 SPY $200 puts from March 17th (previous day) in the lower left\n\nPuts are worth $17.344, up 60X from previous month.\n\n3,499 June-30-2020 SPY PUTS with net cost basis of 2.4534 (cost would be $858,444.66). market value of $6,072,512. The net cost basis shows she didn't just hold, she's been buying or trading.\n\nno other meaningful positions except for the June-30-2020 PUTS\n\n**April 6, 2020  ACCOUNT = $2,100,962**\n\n[https://twitter.com/DanielleFong/status/1247260622246383616](https://twitter.com/DanielleFong/status/1247260622246383616)\n\nSaid \"this is what a good day looks like\" because if you look at how far her account has dropped in the last 3 weeks. losing $400K seems like a good day compared with some of the worst days.\n\nfirst pic shows 5,024 June-30-2020 SPY PUTS with net cost basis of $4.344 (cost would be 2,182,425.6\u202c), market value of $1,979,456\n\nsecond pic shows purchases of 3,324 June-30-2020 PUTS at around an average price of $4 (cost would be $1,329,600). Trading and not just holding.\n\n**April 7th  ACCOUNT = ???**\n\n[https://twitter.com/daniellefong/status/1247859562167898113](https://twitter.com/daniellefong/status/1247859562167898113)\n\nSays she only took out $250K for family and to invest. Says she thinks the puts will be worth $20 (still? really?)\n\n**May 29, 2020  ACCOUNT = $130K plus $250K withdrawn**\n\nShe had $84K in her account on Feb 21st. Other than her SPY puts, she had about $60K in her account on April 7th.\n\nShe kept trading/buying PUTS, short term traded and dumped other positions and might have added money since the start but that isn't known. June 2020 $200 SPY puts are now worth $0.14 which is half what she bought them for originally. If she held the 5,025 PUTS from April 6th, they are now worth $70K.\n\n**June 30, 2020  ACCOUNT PREDICTION = $60K plus $250K withdrawn**\n\nEnd of June the SPY puts expire worthless dropping her account value to $60K which is less than when she started. But she says she withdrew $250K so she has that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo bad vibes intended. There was lots of speculation in the other thread. Wanted to look it up myself.
