I hope everyone on this subreddit made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 22nd, 2019.\n\n# **Week ahead: Earnings, GDP expected to show sluggish growth as investors await rate cut  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/19/earnings-gdp-to-show-sluggish-gains-as-some-see-big-rate-cut-coming.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Sluggish economic and earnings growth will be a theme in markets in the week ahead, as investors await a Fed interest rate cut at the end of the month.\n*****\n&gt; More than a quarter of the S&amp;P 500 companies report earnings in the coming week, the second big week of the second quarter reporting season. FAANG names, like Alphabet and Amazon, and blue chips from McDonald\u2019s to Boeingand United Technologies are among the more than 130 companies reporting.\n*****\n&gt; There is also some key economic data, including Friday\u2019s second quarter GDP, which should show a slowing to 1.8% from the first quarter\u2019s 3.1% pace, according to Refinitiv. On Thursday, durable goods are reported and will include an update on businesses investment. There are also existing home sales Tuesday, new home sales Wednesday and advance economic indicators Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; But there will be no Fed speakers, after a parade of central bank officials in the past week, including Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The most impactful comments, however, came Thursday from New York Fed President John Williams, who set off a debate about how much the Fed could cut rates at its July 30-31 meeting \u2014 25 or 50 basis points.\n*****\n&gt; Even as the New York Fed later said Williams comments were not about current policy, market pros took heed of his words about how central bankers should \u201cact quickly.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Fed dominates\n&gt; Fed officials do not speak publicly in the days ahead of policy meetings, but market pros will find plenty to debate. Fed funds futures were predicting a 43% chance of a 50 basis point cut in July, after shooting as high as 70% Thursday afternoon.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cFor sure, the Fed is going to dominate for next week. I think we\u2019ll get at least a 25 basis point cut. I\u2019m thinking we\u2019re not going to get 50 basis point cut...The Fed has been burned when it\u2019s been bold,\u201d said Tony Roth, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust.\n*****\n&gt; Roth said he believes the market is already pricing in a quarter-point cut, and he does not see the Fed\u2019s rate cut as much of a longer-term catalyst for stocks. If it trims by a half percentage point, he expects just a short-term pop.\n*****\n&gt; Economists believe the Fed will cut interest rates even though recent data has improved. That\u2019s in part because Powell has stressed the Fed is focused on the global economic slowdown, trade wars and low inflation, and that it will do what it takes to keep the economy expanding.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe only real catalyst that would really help the market would be if there was a trade deal with China,\u201d Roth said. \u201cI think the likelihood of that is less than &gt; 10%. We\u2019re very pessimistic on the possibility of a real deal with China prior to the [2020 presidential] election.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; So, in the void ahead of the Fed\u2019s meeting, the market will be watching earnings. As earnings rolled out this past week, stocks took a rest from their record-setting streak, as some companies lowered forecasts and most beat earnings and revenue estimates.\n*****\n&gt; As of Friday morning, 77% of the roughly 80 companies reporting had beaten earnings estimates, and 65% topped revenue forecasts, according to Refinitiv. Based on actual reports and forecasts, earnings per share for the S&amp;P companies are expected to be up 1% in the second quarter. That is up from expectations that the profit growth would be slightly negative this quarter.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf you look at the numbers, we\u2019re above the averages for top and bottom line beats, but at the same time when you look at revisions, every day we\u2019re getting revisions for third and fourth quarter, and they\u2019re coming down.There\u2019s a real worry of an earnings recession, when you get out into the third and fourth quarter and out to next year,\u201d Roth said.\n*****\nRoth said he\u2019s currently neutral on risk assets, and he sees a slowdown brewing in the smallest U.S. companies that could spread up the food chain.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe do see those fundamental cracks in the economy in small business and the small business labor market, and on top of that you have these big macro risks out there,\u201d such as trade and the upcoming election, Roth said.\n*****\n&gt; Slower economy\nAs earnings growth was muted in the second quarter, so was the pace of economic gains. If growth comes in as expected, it would be the first quarter where growth was under 2% since the first quarter of 2017. Economists are watching to see how consumer spending fared in the quarter, after a recent pickup and also whether business inventories are declining.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe data we need is not Q2. What\u2019s at risk is the growth and magnitude of the Fed rate cut. I don\u2019t think Q2 is going to have much impact on the Fed\u2019s thinking,\u201d said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. \u201cIt\u2019s really how Q3 is progressing. It seems to me the economy softened in April and May and picked up in June with jobs data, retail sales and manufacturing sector.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Chandler said investors will also be focused on the European Central Bank, which some economists believe could cut its overnight deposit rate to negative 0.5% from negative 0.4% currently when it meets Thursday. Chandler said odds are about 50% for the rate cut, which many also expect in September.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhile we\u2019re waiting for the Fed to figure out whether it\u2019s 25 or 50 basis points, and we\u2019re waiting for the ECB to get all its forms sorted out ... the emerging markets are pushing ahead,\u201d said Chandler, noting Russia and Turkey could cut rates in the next several days, after similar moves in the past week by South Africa, South Korea and Indonesia.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt just makes the story more global. You\u2019re seeing the trade numbers from China, Japan, Singapore and South Korea weaken. You\u2019re seeing exports form China suffer. Exports from all of Asia are suffering,\u201d he said. \u201cThe big surprise for China and Japan has also been on the import side. The declines in their imports is really someone else\u2019s [drop in] exports.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Rate cuts and currency wars\n&gt; Dollar strength has been a consequence of the trade war, and Fed action could help turn it around.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIf the Fed fails to move, you\u2019re going to end up with an increasingly stronger dollar,\u201d which impacts corporate earnings, Roth said.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe dollar is quite strong and is increasingly going to be a headwind for U.S. companies. It hasn\u2019t appreciated that much in 12 months, but if we see a divergence in monetary policy between the U.S. and the rest of the world, you would see a carry trade develop where people would want to buy assets in the U.S.,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; The dollar index was slightly higher on the week, but Wall Street has been focused on President Donald Trump\u2019s negative comments on the currency\u2019s strength. As Trump has criticized the Fed, he also complains that other central banks manipulate their currencies to give them an edge in trade. Trump has said the Fed should already be cutting rates, something it hasn\u2019t done since December 2008.\n*****\n&gt; A number of Wall Street strategists have said they now believe it is possible that the U.S. government could intervene to weaken the dollar, but that would be unlikely.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/8bQTV6V.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/VTxqFGv.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/WrQUoRV.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/2hFiohV.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OoGmE9d.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2CHYLC5.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NeqxQgh.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NsR6Mul.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for next month:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AxpixDx.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/C6gLEmQ.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/gE39Fcz.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/fPy6jGK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/Dt3m9no.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Lagging Small-caps: Seasonal and Economic Factors Weigh\n\n&gt; Small-caps measured by the performance of the Russell 2000 have been lagging since mid-March with the gap in performance widening in June and continuing into July. At yesterday\u2019s close the Russell 2000 was up 15.35% year-to-date compared to a gain of 19.87% for the Russell 1000. Based upon historical trends this is not unusual for this time of the year nor during times when U.S. economic data is mixed.\n\n&gt; In the following chart the one-year seasonal pattern of the Russell 2000/Russell 1000 has been plotted (solid black line with grey fill) along with 2019 year-to-date (blue line). This chart is similar to the chart found on page 110 of the 2019 Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac. When the lines are rising small-caps are outperforming, when the lines are falling small-caps are lagging. Small-caps exhibited typical seasonal strength during the first quarter but have been fading ever since. In some years, small-cap strength can last until mid-June however, that is not the case this year. Going forward, small-cap underperformance is likely to persist until early in the fourth quarter with possible a hint of strength at the end of August.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c97818f9fc5794abe9d3a1a2f7d7a86f/2d71c769f6761948-99/s500x750/53d382992f13bd99136d3b251827f09ddca22a28.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Robust Summer Rallies Trim Fall Pullbacks\n\n&gt; It\u2019s usually about this time of the year, when trading volumes begin to slump and markets meander that we begin to hear talk of the infamous \u201cSummer Rally\u201d featured on page 74 of the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac 2019. The \u201cSummer Rally\u201d is usually the weakest seasonal rally of them all.\n\n&gt; We looked at the current Summer Rally and found it to be above average already, up 10.2% from the Spring low on May 31, and that does portend well for the Summer and Fall Corrections. We lined up the Summer Rallies ranked from weakest to strongest since 1964. Over the past 55 years prior to this year DJIA has rallied and average of 9.1% from its May/June low until its Q3 high. The Fall Rally averages 10.9% and the Summer and Fall Corrections average a loss of just under 9% for a net average gain of a few percentage points over the summer and fall.\n\n&gt; As shown in the table below, when the Summer Rally is greater than or equal to the 55-year 9.1% average, the summer and fall correction tend to be bit milder, -6.2% and -8.2%, respectively. Summer Rally gains beyond 12.5% historically had the smallest summer and fall corrections. One prominent exception being 1987.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/aa18216f6df1de6ac90759ac5a0b385f/79600709b9fc3830-aa/s1280x1920/f59022462ad7775809b9c5f641596fc2c4fba59d.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Earnings (and Guidance) Likely to Make or Break the Rally\n\n&gt; Once again today, DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ closed at new all-time highs. With today\u2019s modest gains, DJIA is up 17.3% year-to-date. S&amp;P 500 is even better at 20.2% while NASDAQ is still best at 24.5%. Compared to historical average performance in pre-election years at this time of the year, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 are comfortably above average. NASDAQ\u2019s impressive 24.5% gain is just average (since 1971). NASDAQ\u2019s Midyear Rally delivered again, but officially ended last Friday. The seasonal pattern charts, above and below, along with July\u2019s typical performance over the last 21 years suggest further gains during the balance of July and the third quarter could be limited. For the market to make meaningful gains in the near-term earnings will need to decent and forward guidance will also need to be firm.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3332e35ed31c0d2cc96388c4874b7940/ae2c899522e4f89b-5f/s500x750/4b0be35b9ebf5994fd0ba98fdd9ad19e5308d9ad.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ab6465c9a919dccdf14ae6211b737e61/ae2c899522e4f89b-f8/s500x750/f3c268d9e5c3880ed81d794c9e014ebca127e228.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ab2826ccdc393155d3d0a27a87b59c30/ae2c899522e4f89b-5f/s500x750/4c8831924ff381f4ae7e9cf5c26460a9a7048e96.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# \"We Don't Need Your Stinking Data\"\n\n&gt; Yesterday was another one of those days that makes you scratch your head. In a relatively busy day for economic data, Initial Jobless Claims came in within 25K of a 50-year low, and the Philly Fed Manufacturing report saw its largest m/m increase in a decade. That follows other data last week where Retail Sales were very strong and CPI and PPI both came in ahead of consensus forecasts. The trend of better than expected data since the June employment report on July 5th is reflected in recent moves of the Citi Economic Surprise Index which has rallied from -68.3 up to -41.5. Granted, it\u2019s still negative, but what was looking like a real dismal backdrop for the economy just three weeks ago seems to be showing signs of improvement.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/071819-Citi.png))**\n\n&gt; On top of the economic data, two notable interviews from FOMC officials Williams from New York and Vice Chair Clarida moved markets. Given the strong tone of economic data, one would expect both officials to try and tone down rising market expectations regarding any aggressive policy moves at the July meeting. Well, markets don\u2019t always make sense.\n\n&gt; In their respective interviews, both Williams and Clarida not only didn\u2019t tone down expectations, but they added fuel to the fire. Williams noted that \u201cit pays to act quickly to lower rates\" and \"vaccinate\u201d the economy \"against further ills.\" Clarida was even more direct when he said that \u201cResearch shows you act preemptively when you can.\u201d In other words, the data-dependent Fed is casting the data aside and ready to move anyway. In his interview on Fox Business, Clarida almost got a chuckle when asked whether there was any chance the Fed wouldn\u2019t cut rates in July.\n\n&gt; The dovish turn from the Fed was immediately reflected in market expectations for rate policy at the July meeting. Back in June, market expectations for a 50 basis points (bps) cut at the next meeting peaked out at under 50%. Then, in the days following the June employment report, expectations dropped all the way down to 3%. In the last ten days, though, the trend has completely reversed, and as of yesterday\u2019s close topped out at 71% versus just a 29% chance for a 25 bps cut. Probabilities for a 50 bps cut came in a bit overnight but are still at about 50/50. Yesterday alone, though, expectations for a 25 bps cut and a 50 bps cut more than completely reversed from the prior day, and remember, that\u2019s after what was a good day of economic data! Can you imagine what expectations would be like if the data was actually bad?\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/071819-Rate-cut-Odds.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# US Beats World When It Comes to Stocks\n\n&gt; The Bloomberg World index is a cap-weighted index made up of nearly 5,000 stocks from around the world (including US stocks). While the S&amp;P 500 has been hitting new all-time highs over the last week, the Bloomberg World index remains 7% below highs that it last made back in January 2018.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bworld.png))**\n\n&gt; Below is a chart showing the ratio of the S&amp;P 500 to the Bloomberg World index since the World index's inception back in August 2003. While the World index outperformed the US for five years in the mid-2000s, the US has been outperforming since the end of 2007, which includes both the Financial Crisis and the bull market that has been in place since the 2009 lows.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/USvsworld.png))**\n\n&gt; Along with the relative strength chart between the two indices above, below we show the price change of the S&amp;P 500 versus the Bloomberg World index since August 2003. Through today, the S&amp;P was up 203% versus a gain of 142% for the Bloomberg World index.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/percentchange.png))**\n\n&gt; Since the November 2016 election, the S&amp;P 500 is up 40% versus a gain of 26% for the Bloomberg World index. Notably, the World index kept up with the S&amp;P through early 2018, but weakness for the World index in mid-2018 and a failure to bounce back as much as the US this year has left the World index well behind.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/sinceelection.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Best Performing Stocks Over the Last 12 Months\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is up over 20% YTD, but over the last 12 months, it is up just under 10% on a total return basis. And within the S&amp;P 1500, there are only 44 stocks that are up more than 50% on a total return basis over the last 12 months. These 44 stocks are listed below.\n\n&gt; Innovative Industrials (IIPR) -- a cannabis REIT -- has been the best performing stock in the S&amp;P 1500 over the last year with a total return of 302%. In second place is eHealth (EHTH) with a gain of 269%, followed by Avon Products (AVP) at +174.8% and Coca-Cola Bottling (COKE) at +128.58%. Coca-Cola Bottling is probably one of the last names you would have guessed as a top five performer over the last year! Other notables on the list of biggest winners include Advanced Micro (AMD), LendingTree (TREE), Starbucks (SBUX), AutoZone (AZO), Chipotle (CMG), Hershey (HSY), and Procter &amp; Gamble (PG).\n\n&gt; Some names that aren't on the list that you may have expected to see? AMZN, NFLX, MSFT? Nope. None of the mega-cap Tech companies are on the list of biggest winners due to serious weakness from this group in Q4 2018.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/totalreturnbest.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# 2% Days Few and Far Between\n\n&gt; Although the last two trading days have seen exceptionally narrow daily ranges, today we wanted to take a quick look at the S&amp;P 500's frequency of 2% daily moves (either up or down) in the post-WWII period. The chart below breaks out the frequency of 2% days by year, and years with more than 25 one-day moves of 2% are notated accordingly.\n\n&gt; Overall, there have been an average of 11 daily 2% moves in a given year. After five straight years from 2007 to 2011 where we saw an above-average number of 2% days, the last seven years have only seen one year with an above-average number of occurrences (2018, 21). Remember, in 2017 there wasn't one single trading day that saw the S&amp;P move up or down 2%!\n\n&gt; So far this year, there have only been four 2% days, but with the most volatile part of the year on tap, we are likely to see that number increase in the months ahead. Don't expect the relative calm that we have seen in the last few trading days to last forever. Volatility is unpredictable and usually comes up and surprises you when you least expect it!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/071619-2-percent-Days.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending July 19th, 2019** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 07.21.19**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cyNLfH0eOE))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$FB** \n&gt; * **$AMZN** \n&gt; * **$TSLA** \n&gt; * **$BA** \n&gt; * **$T** \n&gt; * **$SNAP** \n&gt; * **$PIXY** \n&gt; * **$HAL** \n&gt; * **$TWTR** \n&gt; * **$KO** \n&gt; * **$F** \n&gt; * **$V** \n&gt; * **$LMT** \n&gt; * **$GOOGL** \n&gt; * **$INTC** \n&gt; * **$CAT** \n&gt; * **$PYPL** \n&gt; * **$BIIB** \n&gt; * **$UTX** \n&gt; * **$IRBT** \n&gt; * **$XLNX** \n&gt; * **$UPS** \n&gt; * **$ABBV** \n&gt; * **$CNC** \n&gt; * **$NOK** \n&gt; * **$CMG** \n&gt; * **$MMM** \n&gt; * **$RPM** \n&gt; * **$SBUX** \n&gt; * **$JBLU** \n&gt; * **$BMY** \n&gt; * **$GNC** \n&gt; * **$MCD** \n&gt; * **$CDNS** \n&gt; * **$CADE** \n&gt; * **$NOW** \n&gt; * **$AMTD** \n&gt; * **$HAS** \n&gt; * **$HOG** \n&gt; * **$ANTM** \n&gt; * **$WM** \n&gt; * **$CMCSA** \n&gt; * **$FCX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/AxpixDx.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/nbxFajQ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/wDSrEig.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.22.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/CMtV2wY.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.22.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/XMDLX1P.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.23.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/omY8irw.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.23.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SNZsXSr.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.24.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/VZpnvNK.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Z1aYu3T.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.24.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/baG5LHw.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/u5ltfBM.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.25.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/Vrmxs5A.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/b5Clktv.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.25.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/vCFpMWf.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/rK5oZyA.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.26.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EKjq3DH.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.26.19 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Amazon.com, Inc. $1,964.52\n&gt; **Amazon.com, Inc.
