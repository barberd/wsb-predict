{"id": "bko4ca", "title": "A Quick Question", "selftext": "So here\u2019s the deal guys. I have $18k in my account, made $2K off PBYI and another $2k off GUSH. I want to continue to grow this into $25k to beat the PTD rule. I don\u2019t care for options. I got lucky once with $SEEL as well. Should I continue to do ETF\u2019s like under $10 bucks and swing them? What\u2019s the best strategy anybody can give me? The most I lost was on $150 on $UGAZ because I had no idea what I was doing. Any ideas or strategies for my relatively small account?", "created_utc": 1556994322, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bko4ca/a_quick_question/", "is_self": true}
