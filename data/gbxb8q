His tweets today arguably gave everyone fair warning of these pending sales (\"selling almost all physical possessions\").   Shares are physical possessions. \n\n3/  These funds will be plenty to defend himself and the officers and directors from lawsuits when [$TSLA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&src=ctag) fails. Furthermore, this tweetstorm will help in the legal battle.   \nCalling out your shares as overvalued negates significant claims from anyone buying or holding the shares. \n\n4/  It is now common knowledge that EM is selling his possessions and thinks the shares are overvalued. How can anyone sue? Furthermore, his tweets might result in his dismissal as CEO in the very near term (30 days?). Provides enough time to clean up any internal smoking guns. \n\n 5/ Most bears know that bringing in the fresh eyes of an outside CEO will hasten the rapid demise of Tesla.   The accounting, regulatory, and other fraud has been massive.   When this goes it will go fast.   However, the global pandemic and factory closure provide perfect cover. \n\n 6/  So in summary,  EM gets billions out while telling everyone he is doing it, the company will ultimately go BK and can blame COVID-19 the fascist behavior of the government, and his persona will likely keep him out of prison and comfortably in his G650. \n\n 7/ It is the perfect setup and window. He must do it right now or risk lose everything. Can't wait until later in Q2, his window will close. This is much safer than trying to do another offering. With this as the plot, his tweets make perfect sense, and are diabolically brilliant \n\n 8/ Lastly, I believe he is still restricted from selling pursuant to the last equity offering, until May 13th. This can be waived by GS however.  Perhaps GS asked him to \"disclose\" via twitter that he was selling and that the shares were pricey?  all jmho and pure speculation. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTSLA 400P 8/20", "created_utc": 1588384114.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gbxb8q/tsla_could_this_be_the_reason_elon_musk_is/", "is_self": true}
