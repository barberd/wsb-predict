That's right, this forum was originally created on sharing analyses of stocks and such strategies.  Here's my homework:\n\n\\- Their revenues have declined by -16.02%/year (geometric average) in the last 5 years.\n\n\\- They are ramping up long-term debt like crazy, you might think it's not a big deal but this impacts the free-cash flow to equity (FCFE).  FCFE averaged -3.3/share last year which is terrible!\n\n\\- They are increasing their dividend every year giving the illusion that everything is fine but it's masking that it's a sinking ship.  \n\n\\- P/E ratio is around 27 but the industry median is only 16.  \n\n\\- Current Price: 99 / Price target: 79 (-20% drop)", "created_utc": 1573256329, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dtnxkx/short_candidate_yum/", "is_self": true}
