Their only competitors is [Atlantis Events.](https://atlantisevents.com/) \n\nApparently cruise-ship charter terms are very hard-line and non negotiable. Pandemic is actually one of the clauses in the contract that is specifically called out - no refunds for a pandemic to the charter companies:\n\n> The Charter Contract\n>Charters are not part of a cruise line\u2019s standard week-to-week business of selling cruises to the general public. It\u2019s a carve out, run by its own department with its own executives, budgets, sales force, sales goals, operations team, etc. And this one aspect of our relationship with the cruise lines is the one that\u2019s causing most of the confusion as it relates to all that\u2019s going on with Covid-19. Because cruise lines have carved out charters as a separate business, we don\u2019t get the same benefits the general public would get in regard to the rebooking terms and conditions the cruise lines are offering to their standard (read non-charter) passengers. We are being held to a different set of terms. And frankly, they\u2019re not very forgiving.\n\n>In fact, \u201cpandemic\u201d is a specific call out where most of the cruise lines ultimately bear no responsibility whatsoever \u2013 creating a sort of \u201clike it or lump it\u201d scenario. So we\u2019re having to have very complicated conversations \u2013 ones where relationships are worth their weight in gold \u2013 with multi-billion dollar corporations whose charter business is a locked revenue stream for them, not subject to the ups and downs of standard sales (since the contracts are guaranteed so far in advance). These cruise line\u2019s guaranteed charter revenue is sometimes used to balance losses the company might face elsewhere (for instance, during these Covid-19 days where they\u2019re having to give so much back to their non-charter guests). So the cruise lines hold to those contractual guarantees with a tight grip, holding nearly all the cards over the charter companies.\n\n>It\u2019s a really tricky position for us to be in \u2013 caught in a strange in-between. These large corporations can afford to have a bad year. Sure, their shareholders might not like it, but they\u2019re built to withstand even major business disruptions. But make no mistake about it, the cruise lines will lose countless millions here. But\u2026 and it\u2019s a big but\u2026 they are all likely to weather this particular storm. Charter companies like VACAYA are in a much different spot \u2013 unable to amortize losses across fleets of ships sailing week in and week out like the cruise lines can. We are an event company \u2013 with set events throughout the year. So we have to approach these challenge in a different way. And our challenges are myriad.\n\nIn general, chartering has become massively popular. There's all kinds of cruise ship charters - nude cruises, star trek, huge EDM parties, etc. Cruise ships have tons of guaranteed revenue from the charters. Unlike other businesses they had the foresight to prepare for pandemics.\n\n\n# TL;DR what call-strike-etc\nCruise lines are over sold. Buy cruises - they can weather this pandemic and were smart enough to put it in their contracts of their guaranteed revenue. \n\nRCL LEAPS 21 JAN 22, maybe at the money?\n\nRCL220121C20  - trades for 13.00-16.90/share, RCL is $22.30 at the time of this post.
