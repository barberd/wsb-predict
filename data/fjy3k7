I have calls right now but am selling sometime tomorrow.\n\n**Positions or ban** https://imgur.com/c3vjRgs\n\nThis weekend in Chicago I saw the biggest cesspool of young 20 something year olds at bars and parties for saint Patrick\u2019s day partying drunk af all day. Some of them even had the balls to go to brunch the day after and continue partying after floating around in a sea of disease. That\u2019s a compounding effect. No one took it seriously UNTIL TODAY. Now everyone is finally staying home. But the damage is done.\n\nThis weekend will be the reckoning in Chicago (and New York, Paris and any other city center that didn\u2019t take it seriously the past weekend). We are so unprepared here. Try googling \u201cwhere to get corona virus test\u201d. THERE IS NO SIMPLE ANSWER OR LOCATOR (at least for Chicago). You have to dig for an answer. So what do you do? Go to a hospital. They will be flooded this weekend. Pray for your medical professional friends.\n\nBLOOD WILL RUN BLACK.\n\n\n\n**List of commenters that have confirmed their city also didn\u2019t give a fuck (will continue to update):**\n\nDenver | edit: most college towns in Denver as well\n\nSmall town somewhere\n\nOK ALL OF FLORIDA of fucking course god damnit Florida cities listed so far...
