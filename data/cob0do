{"id": "cob0do", "title": "Shiller PE Ratio", "selftext": "Hey guys... here's the Shiller PE ratio. Basically just a PE ratio formula (price to earnings) calculated by this Shiller guy. High ratio means more expensive equities compared to earnings.\n\nIt's updated in real time and shows us the relative prices of equities. \n\nRight now we're on the high side. \n\nNotably, we haven't had a Shiller PE below 15 since before 1990. So we may have a new \"low\" of around 20 PE ratio, who knows. But it's good to bookmark this page to follow along as we move forward.", "created_utc": 1565397034, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cob0do/shiller_pe_ratio/", "is_self": true}
