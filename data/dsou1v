Explained (gone sexual)", "selftext": "I get you guys are autistic and all, but let me tell you how the market works sometimes. \n\nConsumer optimism and hype can inflate companies well beyond (ha bynd ha) the market cap/price that those companies deserve.

The answer is that wallstreet expected an even larger beat than what actually happened. Such is the case with ROKU.\n\nHere's an IRL comparison to help you understand. \n\n  It would be like me pulling down my pants and showing your mother my 8 inch cock.
