I never had an account with them because I don't trust companies run by hipsters.\n\nYou may be aware of the original Robin Hood, the legendary heroic outlaw originally depicted in English folklore who is known for stealing from the rich and giving to the poor.\n\nWell Robinhood the app, does the exact opposite. This is probably not news to anyone here, about how a huge portion of their revenue comes from selling order flow to HFT firms, etc.\n\n&gt;According to a [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-15/robinhood-gets-almost-half-its-revenue-in-controversial-bargain-with-high-speed-traders) report last year, Robinhood brought in more than 40 percent of its revenue in early 2018 from selling its customers\u2019 orders to high-frequency trading firms, or market makers.\n\nBut did you also know that the **trades aren't even conducted on the market**?!?!\n\nYou're just trading with other Robinhood retards.\n\n&gt;Robinhood has faced criticism over its reliance on high-frequency traders, especially considering a founding ethos that some have categorized as \u201canti-Wall Street.\u201d The company sends customers\u2019 orders to high-frequency trading firms like Virtu or Citadel Securities instead of a stock exchange like the NYSE. **These trades are executed in what\u2019s known as a dark pool, which as the name suggests, lacks some transparency.**\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/18/a-controversial-part-of-robinhoods-business-tripled-in-sales-thanks-to-high-frequency-trading-firms.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/18/a-controversial-part-of-robinhoods-business-tripled-in-sales-thanks-to-high-frequency-trading-firms.html)\n\nSo what's a dark pool? It's basically like a parallel exchange, disconnected from the market. So you aren't trading on the market, you are just trading with other losers.\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dark-pool.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dark-pool.asp)\n\nFuck robinhood, they think you're too stupid to realize you're getting fleeced!", "created_utc": 1576362530, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eaqdpz/til_robinhood_is_literally_a_dark_pool_and_steals/", "is_self": true}
