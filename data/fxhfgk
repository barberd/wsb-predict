{"id": "fxhfgk", "title": "Opening by May 30th is a Joke", "selftext": "The model that everybody seems to get tits up excited about is this one.\n\n [https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america) \n\nIt's by a group that was initially funded by the Bill and Malinda Gates foundation. It is predicting that the last death in the USA will be recorded around May 30th. Everybody can celebrate, buy the fuck out of their favorite stocks, and have one hell of a gay bull orgy fest on May 31st when the bars finally open.\n\nAnd it's wrong. Here's my argument.\n\nFirst, the model is based on recorded deaths in the USA. We know for a fact that recorded deaths is incomplete data. Basically, there is A LOT of evidence that there are people who died of pneumonia recently that have not been tested for the COVID-19. \n\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/coronavirus-death-toll-americans-are-almost-certainly-dying-of-covid-19-but-being-left-out-of-the-official-count/2020/04/05/71d67982-747e-11ea-87da-77a8136c1a6d\\_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/coronavirus-death-toll-americans-are-almost-certainly-dying-of-covid-19-but-being-left-out-of-the-official-count/2020/04/05/71d67982-747e-11ea-87da-77a8136c1a6d_story.html)\n\nThey stopped testing a lot of patients because there is very little healthcare value in doing so. The tests should be focused on people it can help. \n\nGarbage in, garbage out. The model isn't factoring in the hundreds or possibly thousands of deaths that haven't been confirmed. It also doesn't know about the thousands \n\nSecond, unless we have sufficient testing, confirmed cases and deaths are meaningless. This is the opinion of Nate Silver. The guy who predicted before the 2016 election that Trump had a 33% chance of winning the election when everybody else said he had a 10% chance. \n\n[https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/coronavirus-case-counts-are-meaningless/](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/coronavirus-case-counts-are-meaningless/)\n\nThird, if you download Nate's \"covidia\" excel model, and look at the default values for this model, you'll see that after the peak you have to wait 95 days before the virus effectively dies out (less than \\~300 new infections, which is 30x the population of \"covidia\"). That's with an anemic R0 value of 0.6 (meaning social distancing reduced how contagious the virus is by about 5X, which is pretty reasonable). \n\nWe haven't seen a peak in detected cases. Even if it was last Saturday, according to Nate's mental exercise model,  we're still looking at July 4th before there are only 300 new cases. AND those 300 cases are still enough to start a new outbreak. Realistically, we need to wait a couple more weeks past the last confirmed case for it to die down.\n\nFour, do you think the stupid fuck Trump is going to force you to stay home with \"only\" 500 confirmed cases in the USA? What about DeSantos who only closed Florida after there were 163 deaths and 8000 confirmed cases. Would he keep Florida closed with \"only\" a thousand non-recovered cases? Yeah, the lack of science in our politicians is going to fuck us. To stop a second wave, we have to stay in quarantine for weeks AFTER the last confirmed case. Basically, our politicians are spinless globs of cherry jello. \n\nFive, the second-third-fourth-fifth wave. If we don't wait long enough to open up and reverse social distancing, the R0 value goes back up. Even with contact tracing and all the titillating stuff South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan have done, they still have an increase in cases. Contact tracing and lots of testing is not sufficient to drop the R0 value below 1.\n\n [https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) \n\nSix, you don't need a full lockdown to fuck our economy sixteen ways sideways. Our economy was 11 years into a bull run. The market was begging for a recession, but Donald Pump couldn't help but inject all his magic juice into his bubble for reelection. You get debt, you get debt, you get debt, EVERYBODY GETS DEBT. Debt doesn't create a strong economy. The stupid fuck doesn't realize that you can't just declare bankruptcy and the economy goes on hunky dory. \n\nThere was WAY too much optimism in the economy. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's only bad if too many people are buying Mercedes on subprime refinances on their house. It's bad when people are spending $100k on credit or in subprime business loans to remodel a restaurant in the fucking mall.  \n\nWe're at the first wave of bankruptcies and business failures with the 2% increase in unemployment. The second and third and fourth waves are down the line, even if we could get back to work on May 30th. Delta and Lufthansa get this shit. There is a reason why they are putting planes in long term storage and grounding planes indefinitely. Hint: It's not because they think in 2 months they will be flying the same volume they were 2 months ago. Someone in their management has been through these shit storms and know it's going to last longer than the virus.\n\nI'm almost certain what we got on this new bull run is a lot of money managers saying \"we hit the bottom, everything is ON SALE! We're going to have a V shaped recovery.\" Money managers are basing those opinions on exactly 1/4 of their morning jizz stain. Listen to any economist and they say \"indicators say we got a V recovery coming.\" More, they have no fucking clue. The reason, they don't base their opinions on Jizz. Instead, they base them on the indicators in the economy. And they simply don't have any data to point to a recovery. \n\nSo that leaves me with our bull run. It's based on Hope. Hope that there will be a V shaped recovery. Hope in investing is the fastest way to get you fucked. Wallstreet is like a dark alley with rapists everywhere. Hope won't stop them.\n\nDisclosure: I'm short a shit ton of oil and hotel stocks. Short BA. I got a couple covered calls on WMT and AMD. I also have a few spreads on airlines and real estate because this market went fucking sideways with it's FOMO. I'm also holding about 40% of my portfolio in cash. Basically, I'm stupid fuck, so don't take my word for any of this.", "created_utc": 1586388831.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxhfgk/opening_by_may_30th_is_a_joke/", "is_self": true}
