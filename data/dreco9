I had to pause the project when I lost my @$$ on some AMD FD's. I did well (Thanks PG&amp;E) and just like any responsible adult immediately finished putting my winnings into Gold. Can't go tits up.\n\nI want to thank my fellow autists @ [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) for giving me the advice I needed to lose my money and no good advice to make it back.\n\nThis is a 2011 Honda CBR250R that is anything but stock.  \nIt even has lasers! When the blinkers are on it shines the lasers into the area where I am going.  \nThe rear laser actually does get drivers to stop tailgating.\n\nI purchased the stolen gold from the Mexican government. It was being sold as evidence from a case and I got it for under $60. I was amazed when nobody else bid on it and did the greatest thing I could think of. 6 Layers of gold minimum with what felt like 20 gallons of clear coat.\n\nThe panels were originally too reflective and the gold was absolutely blinding. So I re-layered the clear coat after hitting it with some sandpaper to tone it down a bit. Still came out amazing.\n\nFun Fact :  \nBringing it home from the shop I stopped to fill it and got jumped by a cougar.  \nWoman well over 60 filling at the opposite pump walked up and said, \"I don't normally go for bad boys but, with an all gold motorcycle I might reconsider it.\"  \nAll I could say was, \"Thanks.\"  \nShe replied, \"Let me know if you change your mind.\"  \nI was dying laughing all the way home.  \nMaybe too much attention getting with this bike.  \n\n\nNever forget :  \nAutism is a spectrum and I've gone around twice.", "created_utc": 1572852971, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dreco9/you_amazing_bastards_made_this_possible_i_love/", "is_self": true}
