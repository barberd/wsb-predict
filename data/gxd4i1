I have found the key to the land of infinite tendies and present to you a once in a lifetime opportunities to make your portfolio start looking like one of Jerome's printers.\n\nAs many of you autists know, $DOCU reported earnings on Thursday afternoon, with adjusted earnings being 12 cents a share, with revenue rising 39% to $297 million (beat estimates by 20%). Compare this to a year earlier, DocuSign earned 7 cents a share on sales of $214 million. Despite these amazing beats, the stock saw an AH and early morning pump by nearly 5% followed by a quick sell off from those who were trying to capitalize on gains. EOD 6/5 has interesting patterns though, as the stock nearly climbed $2/share on the last 5 minutes of power hour, suggesting that perhaps some insider trading could be happening and good things might come next week.\n\nAs a SaaS company, $DOCU has little costs and major upside gains. Currently major companies are already starting to shift into using $DOCU as a product.\n\nWedbush, along with other analyst companies, announced today that it has changed the price target for $DOCU to $165. This is extremely interesting news as these reports came out in the latter half end of the trading day, suggesting that interesting behavior might happen in the next week or so.$DOCU isn't just a coronavirus stock like other shits $ZM which will fall right after COVID-19 ends. Imagine going back to work, would you like to use the pen on your cum crusted carpet underneath your desk to sign 500 papers or would you rather just click \"OK\" 500 times so you can get back to buying FDs? The demand from here on out will only go up, and with little competition and very nice growth, I do not see $DOCU going anywhere but up.\n\nPOSITIONS:6/19 $145c(severely underpriced contract due to IV drop this morning, -40% change despite only -0.30% movement in underlying asset)\n\n7/17 $155cmore conservative bet for mid-long term growth\n\n9/18 $220c\n\nnot an fd, but a fucking ad (autist's delight)  \n\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1591391279.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gxd4i1/get_your_cocku_into_doku/", "is_self": true}
