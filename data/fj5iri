{"id": "fj5iri", "title": "DD- Citrix (CTXS) Calls", "selftext": "I worked in IT at 50k+ employee engineering firm. Everybody is free to work from home beginning Monday that can. We have certain programs like CAD or Revit on local servers. The latency is too shitty running off standard VPN to effectively run those programs, so we're having to up our virtual machines to run near the local servers.\n\nWe tried calling Citrix multiple times to up our VMs, but couldn't get through because all the lines were clogged with other companies doing the same. We spent $20M with them in 2019 and couldn't even get through to a salesman this week. \n\nI'm going to wait for another circuit breaker dip this week then CTXS $115c for May 01. Their quarterly earnings come out in April. I'm a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b with SPY puts, but CTXS is going to have awesome sales this quarter with every company trying to support work from home. Get some cheap calls for their April quarterly earnings release. VMware (VMW) is likely another decent company for some calls.", "created_utc": 1584295497.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fj5iri/dd_citrix_ctxs_calls/", "is_self": true}
