Could have made a fortune there - should have gone with my gut. either way - here are my plays for the rest of the week.\n\nATVI 66c 5/8 (reporting tomorrow after close)\n\nCVNA 89c 5/8 (reporting Wednesday after close) I read their 10k for 2019 and it was damn impressive. I think Jan, Feb were good to them and i think because of their business model they don't see as big of an affect as companies think.\n\nPinterest 25c 5/8 (reporting tomorrow after close) Had a great year last year in terms of DAU. You know how much stonks love DAU. After what i saw last week, i think the combination of increased engagement and Pinterest finally learning how to monetize their platforms plays well for them going into earnings.\n\nCVS 66c 5/8 (reporting before open on Wed) I'm not sold on this one yet. Still doing my DD but the homie u/kennytran32 hooked it up\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThoughts?", "created_utc": 1588683645.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gdxakc/plays_for_today/", "is_self": true}
