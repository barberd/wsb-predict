{"id": "gxw2li", "title": "My BA analysis", "selftext": "As we all know BA has rallied in the past few days. I think it is going to 188 and here is why.\n\nFrom pre crash to the bottom of ba, Ba bounced off the 50% retracement;  https://imgur.com/a/8EwwfZL \n\nSo it bounced- where is it going? From the recent lows from where it started to go up, to the highs from yesterday the retracement; https://imgur.com/a/RLpqygd; lands it at around 188. That is why I think it.\n\nReason it might not work- BA has extreme strength right now and Fomo buyers might blow through the resistance because a lot of times lines dont mean anything.\n\nTldr: BA 200P 6/12 or 6/19 to be safe, tp around 188 and stop if a 4hr candle lands above 225. If BA gaps up to 220, ignore this post.", "created_utc": 1591467367.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gxw2li/my_ba_analysis/", "is_self": true}
