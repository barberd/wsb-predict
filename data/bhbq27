Large amounts of ER will be released, causing some of us joy, and some, probably many of us, sorrow. It is in these hours that we must put faith in the powers that be, namely Jeff Bezos, for it is he that will guide our near futures to either the glorious land of tendies, or broken portfolios. May we be blessed in our bets, our YOLOs, our sometimes very carefully researched plays, or sometimes our \"DD is for nerds.\" Blessed be our market buys, may they strike low. We are chad options traders, we are the most glorious of traders, 100% or not at all. In this, we pray.  \n\n\n  \n *Our MM Father, who art in Wall Street, hallowed be thy Name,*\n\n  *thy tendies come,*\n\n  *thy plays be done,*\n\n  *on RH as it is in TDA.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Give us this day our daily tendies.*\n\n*And forgive us our FDs,*  \n\n*as we forget those who we told to do the same.*  \n\n *And lead us not into FOMOs,*  \n\n*but deliver us from YOLOs.*   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*For the yachts we seek,*  \n\n*and shit plays we reap,* \n\n*it literally can't go tits up.
