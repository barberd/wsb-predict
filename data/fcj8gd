But everything just kept going up. I mean the DOW went up about 5% today but I don\u2019t get why airplane stocks went up as much as they did. They did tank premarket and in the early hours but came from way behind and now most of them are green for the day (or very close to it). Does all the flight cancellations and travel bans do anything to the stock? Unless today was some dead cat bounce (which I\u2019m hoping it is), what is the strategy for the next couple weeks?", "created_utc": 1583184106, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcj8gd/lets_talk_airplanes/", "is_self": true}
