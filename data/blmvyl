{"id": "blmvyl", "title": "UBER IPO TinFoil", "selftext": "Hey guys, with the UBER IPO fast approaching I was doing a bit of research. Looking at LYFT, their current market cap is 17.3 billion. The IPO prospectus values UBER's share price at $44-$50 for 180,000,000 shares, which is 79.2-90 billion market cap. Now I understand that UBER leads LYFT in the ridesharing market, but this is only by about 40% according to market share. However, UBER's prospectus IPO market cap is over 400% that of LYFT's current market cap. Even with UBER eats I do not see Uber having this large of a market cap. I say short Uber from the IPO, but I'd like to hear your guys opinions thanks!", "created_utc": 1557207267, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/blmvyl/uber_ipo_tinfoil/", "is_self": true}
