When M\\*V goes up P\\*Q goes up and likewise the converse.\n\nAs things stand, V is decreasing due to the factors you mentioned above, but FED and congress are mitigating this decrease by supplementing with M or the amount of money in circulation through stimulus and printing (the fed \"prints\" money through loans - as does your bank). So ideally, the M\\*V side of the equation stays - as is - long term. Short term you will see inflation (increase of circulating money) while things balance out but that inflation comes where the loans are distributed and that is among corporations (the rich). We see this inflation in stock prices which are going UP. Companies who are good enough to get loans or stimulus are seeing an increase in stock prices because the amount of money in circulation among these companies is higher. It's like zimbabwe and bread. Nothing about the value of bread changed but because there was more money the price of bread shot up.\n\nLower savings rates/consumption (lower V) is an issue if the FED and congress doesn't offset it but they are offsetting it. Everything is relative. Every other country is currently affected by this pandemic so the FED feels freer to print money as does congress and they will continue to feel free to do so, so long as other countries are in the same position.\n\nThe only way this would become an issue is if it is sustained long term and other countries recover faster than we do - in this case the continued printing of money negatively effects the $ relative to other currencies. This is why it's important that we alone do not suffer a second wave that is relatively worse than other countries this would be a \"shock\" we are not prepared to handle. You'll hear J Powell discuss, as much, in hearings.\n\nAs for job cuts, this is temporary and workers will be rehired they will just be rehired at reduced wages. Those that don't get rehired will be those that belong to dying sectors (think of it like a forest fire - it sucks but is necessary for growth). J Powell discusses this too ( the wealth gap is expected to increase - poor will get poorer rich will get richer). Those who are doing well will be rewarded and those who are not will be screwed. Its late so I'm not gonna edit this for typos but hopefully you get why this DOOMSDAY fall in stocks is unlikely without a \"shock\" to the system.\n\nWorst case scenario we see mass defaults if things aren't balanced correctly -- these defaults will be due to deflation or the amount of lay offs/ lack of income being so significant that V \\* M decreases enough to make loan repayment impossible. This would occur because loans print money by providing the borrower with principal that didn't previously exist... however, it comes with at the cost of interest which grows over time (think of it as theta - interest will fuck you harder and harder over time). Since only principal exists at time of loan creation, the expectation is that the borrower will produce the interest through labor or by increasing productivity/GDP. Less circulating money, however, means that the amount of principal in the system decreases (deflation) and those with debt get fucked/ default while those with capital get more bang for their buck. Anyway, if you care to learn more about this lmk. Otherwise I won't get into it cause it feels like a digression.\n\nBUT JOB LOZZES:\n\nRight now struggling companies which shit books are experiencing deflation or lack of money. They are combatting this with layoffs. Yea, they could just cut wages and allow people to keep their jobs but when you cut wages you get this bullshit:\n\n\"Am engineer, took 10% paycut (Admin just sent out an email midmarch like \"Lol wagecucks\"). Friends on unemploy from gig economy beating my salary now, and I still have to go into office.

No struggling company wants to deal with that - they want grateful workers who are happy not to have been fired. We live in a system of exploitation - get over it.\n\nAnyway, these job losses are temporary and people who want to be rehired now will have less of a problem finding a job at reduced salary ( make this clear in your application). If your job was cut you were not very essential to the company sorry - truth hurts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR -\n\nCan we stop the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b bs? STONKS aren't going down unless the second wave is much worse than expected and relatively worse than other countries.", "created_utc": 1592547053.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbve7m/shutup_and_learn/", "is_self": true}
