Before going long on these, I was previously up about $11k with ES and NQ via scalping. For some stupid reason I decided to go long and hold. P/L day on the way down was over -$41k.\n\nI was so close to closing everything that day because it got so ugly and I was beginning to feel uncomfortable. It was the literally the last day before things started rebounding. That would have sucked, and was the main reason why I didn't close sooner. Don't do that. Either have a stop loss long before shit gets bad, or a mental one.\n\nCurrently I am long 1x ES and 2x NQ at the moment and will see how things go. May add or reduce. Plan to get back into scalping/swing trading futures rather than just holding too long.\n\nAlso still been [selling weekly naked options on AMZN and TSLA](https://i.imgur.com/rpoLBDW.png) since it's free money, but that's a different story.", "created_utc": 1561704332, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c6gwgf/q2_futures_update_and_summary_from_down_6559750/", "is_self": true}
