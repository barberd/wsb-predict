Nikola's official YouTube channel runs YouTube advertisements on their videos. Now you may say ~$1200 dollar YouTube ads is a lot considering that it probably is all of the revenue they will see not only for this year but for the foreseeable future, but I would counter that with for a company of ~250 staff they had to do it so that they could afford coffee for their staff. \nAlso just need to mention Toyota can blow NKLA out of water with 50 of their fuelcell engineers and 25 million budget. No need for a new company that is valued at 25 Billion. Fuelcells aren't revolutionary. \n#theranos2.0", "created_utc": 1592357564.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hahdh6/wsb_investigative_report_on_a_lie_about_nikola/", "is_self": true}
