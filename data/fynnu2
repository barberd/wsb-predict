Buy a call / put exp within a week (Low capital, you can go further out if you have larger rolls)\n3. Leg INTO a debit spread with the one you're selling matching the price of the one you sold or @ a higher price (get paid to take the trade)\n4. Max profit is strike1-strike2 + difference between your sell/buy price\n\nSpy 4/17 200p @ .11, JPM 110C 5/15 @ .25, Spy 4/24 285C @ 1.51, Sell Spy 4/24 286C @ 1.61\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 1) Identifying The Current Trend\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rtnr36kzn1s41.png?width=1257&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3b3b5f918e39fef177ca35c0790afca79dc0458\n\nThis is the easiest part in my eyes, if price action is choppy I'll use a tick chart which gives us these pretty trends up & down. Moving averages can be used as crossover signals or gap fill signals, which I prefer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Highlighted gap fills.](https://preview.redd.it/v64fwnbsp1s41.png?width=520&format=png&auto=webp&s=44e3f35ab2fb6da42891b0058da94ba2401061a9)\n\nThis is a pretty simple one to trade, using 14 & 30SMA on the 30 minute chart, when a candle breaks above or below either, it is around 80% likely that it will trade into the other moving average. This will be your buy signal to buy your first leg of the spread.\n\n2) Buying into the spread\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Buy blue, Sell Purple](https://preview.redd.it/fpenc15fq1s41.png?width=625&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e7d3bcb39daea8f4e9cf4c2ea42e00a94817229)\n\nFor example, I'd buy into the 275 put @ 1.15 then sell into the 273 put @ 1.50.\n\nThis would net me 35$ into my account **guaranteed.** Then leave 200$ on the table if the trade goes my way. Max profit 235$, max loss is -35$ (guaranteed as said before).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is what I've been using to fund OTM puts on spy, my current trade running is shown below:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Bought the 285 @ 1.51, sold 286 @ 1.61 ](https://preview.redd.it/z8of62dfr1s41.png?width=501&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ae1340bfbddf130d6c6cca80d40262fd56c17f1)\n\nThe best part about this is, lets say the trade keeps going your way. LET IT RIDE, you just go into a good trade at a good time, you can sell the even further strike call and leave 1k on the table and instantly profit 300$ into your account. Doing trades like this when you're able to get into a trend early will set you up to get LUCKY. The more trades you make the more chances you have to get **LUCKY**. TA isn't about predicting, It is about finding good entry points to where the trend is most likely to go. If you get lucky you let it ride, if it doesn't go your way you cut losses early.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny questions are welcome, If you guys need more clarity then let me know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExtra Trade Ideas : USO ATM Strangle to play oil news, TSLA 700$ calls 2 weeks out, SPY 200$p 2 weeks out until the market dies, they're cheap asf rn why not play lottos every 2 weeks. It's about getting lucky remember?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT : Since people don't believe these gap fills on SMA's are actually useful, Lets see a plethora of examples.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/26tgwn5cy1s41.png?width=1269&format=png&auto=webp&s=c793ff0533934d561e4f1f497f6f79f17437f64c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/16ah516cy1s41.png?width=1243&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a6d432ba8010830a13e8278b871ae2108b3c112\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8gucus5cy1s41.png?width=1244&format=png&auto=webp&s=bceb707d736c46f59b6c112bdb69bd3ee5f433fb\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x32gb46cy1s41.png?width=1248&format=png&auto=webp&s=57660a41527384a5e85badcb38f9cc4eac53a7ae", "created_utc": 1586549376.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fynnu2/how_to_get_free_money_as_an_autist/", "is_self": true}
