{"id": "dzsqtu", "title": "Update on Robinhood Engineering interview process", "selftext": "As some of you may know, when shit hit the fan with Robinhood\u2019s infinite leverage, I was contacted by Bloomberg due to an SEC filing post (which I\u2019ve hidden) and another post of mine which demonstrated how Robinhood\u2019s temporary \u201cfix\u201d was server-side using my options API was directly linked to a newer article. Because of that post I was contacted by Robinhood for an engineering spot since they seemed to like my project. \n\nThe first interview went well, just getting to know about the team, etc. Second technical interview went pretty well, albeit I hate coding on the spot, got super anxious, and was much slower than I would have liked. I received a third call and was told the position was filled internally but that it was a difficult decision and that\u2019d they\u2019d keep in contact for further openings (may just be super nice letting me down easy, who knows). \n\nAnyways I\u2019m sorry I failed you, but being contacted by them gave me the confidence me to apply to a ton of jobs recently that before I thought would be \u201cout of my league,\u201d and after about 10 interviews in the last two weeks I\u2019ve finished up some further technical interviews and have a few good prospects so I don\u2019t have to off myself at my current job which I\u2019m bored of.
