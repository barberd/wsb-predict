Real estate? companies? supply chains?\n\nthings might get worse this week and we might see even lower numbers by Friday\n\nTL;DR lol retards in WSBs who are saying that hitting $273 doesnt mean anything or not closig than open doesnt mean anything, were going to see another red day tomorrow, if you dont believe me then load up on SPY calls\n\nEdit: When SPY opens at new lows and closes at lows and not green then there is very VERY high probability we are going to see another red day tomorrow, no ones knows for sure but theres something like an 80% chance that itll match today or at least be similar and drop a little more", "created_utc": 1583784526.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fg0wuk/spy_after_hours_hit_new_lows_at_273_get_ready_for/", "is_self": true}
