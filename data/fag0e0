I'm the sole savior of the Stock market today. Instead of a medal of freedom, I'll just take MSFT puts instead, pls.\n\nI got cancer from the market today. So, make a wish, I'm requesting Dwayne the Rock Johnson to cradle me as we watch my options plummet the second after I purchased. I want to die being rocked by the rock while my trades get rocked by some fucking air that thinks it can lung fuck people for eating a zubat instead of just using ember on it like we did with the wobuffets back in '45.\n\nI don't have Tumblr so I don't have a gofundme for being fucked so hard my dick fell off and have \"accidentally\" sat on it the way im fucking myself. \n\nP. S. \n\nI'm typically straighter than the dip in my portfolio. We've all had our experiments before. \n\nWe good?
