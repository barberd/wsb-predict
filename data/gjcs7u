{"id": "gjcs7u", "title": "New Relic: Your Next Big Trade", "selftext": "Autists, last time I gave you Activsion, and this time I bring you a super niche trade that will make you all the monies ahead of earnings tomorrow. It's no other than New Relic, competitor to big time winner Datadog.\n\n**What New Relic Does and how do they make money?**\n\nNew Relic helps track performance for various software applications and services. They make money by charging for the number of hosts. For those who aren't in tech, this means that they make more money as internet traffic increases as long as their customers are getting part of that increase in traffic. If their customers have more traffic, they will have most hosts which means New Relic makes more money ([https://newrelic.com/products/application-monitoring/pricing?utm\\_medium=PS&utm\\_term=2021-Q1&utm\\_offer=new%20relic%20pricing&utm\\_device=c&utm\\_type=Brand-Website-Brand\\_Keywords-AMER-Search&utm\\_source=GAMER-BRAND-000&gclid=CjwKCAjwte71BRBCEiwAU\\_V9h8IhrQa2iUf5k6IArpxYPRp2V8\\_S-s55nVhztoHLswlwA-X1sjUq3hoCs4gQAvD\\_BwE](https://newrelic.com/products/application-monitoring/pricing?utm_medium=PS&utm_term=2021-Q1&utm_offer=new%20relic%20pricing&utm_device=c&utm_type=Brand-Website-Brand_Keywords-AMER-Search&utm_source=GAMER-BRAND-000&gclid=CjwKCAjwte71BRBCEiwAU_V9h8IhrQa2iUf5k6IArpxYPRp2V8_S-s55nVhztoHLswlwA-X1sjUq3hoCs4gQAvD_BwE)).\n\n**Is there proof New Relic is going to do well?**\n\nIn fact, there is! Datadog (my most recent trade) went up 30%+ since last week, and Dynatrace, another competitor, has also been up since. This is mainly because the application monitoring industry as a whole wins from the increase in traffic, not only specific companies.\n\n**Why New Relic?**\n\nIn full disclosure, New Relic is down this year because before coronavirus they projected revenues would go down. However, since that time, the landscape has changed a ton, and I do not believe their slowing in revenue applies anymore, especially since their reporting will include the months of March and April. It's especially a good time to buy considering they went down a ton today, and you can get them at a discount. Additionally, New Relic has been moving more towards future industry trends, which they have lagged in in the past. Competitors have been ahead of the curve to adopt AI and ml as core parts of their monitoring services and over the past year New Relic has invested a lot in making sure they do not fall behind.

Dynatrace and Datadog have already reported and beat earning expectations. I forsee New Relic doing that same, and I think it is a good time to invest to buck on the trend in a company that is not valued as highly as its peers.\n\ntldr: more internet traffic; buy New Relic\n\nBox 09/18 $20C\n\nWIX 06/19 $175C\n\nNEWR 06/19 $65C\n\nNEWR 06/19 $70C\n\nJD 06/19 $49C\n\nSPY 06/15 $283P\n\nSPY 06/30 $279P\n\nSPY 06/30 $280P\n\nEdit: Since y'all want proof of positions, here: [https://imgur.com/a/G8H5VdJ](https://imgur.com/a/G8H5VdJ) ", "created_utc": 1589420622.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gjcs7u/new_relic_your_next_big_trade/", "is_self": true}
