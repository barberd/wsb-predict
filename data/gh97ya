They saw the opportunity in our dumbasses desiring a complete economic fallout and an ever greater Great Depression. All they had to do is push the market up and watch the naive Bears capitulate.\n\nI've seen a few posts mention WSB is starting to turn Bullish, which I agree. It's hard for the retail investor/autist to not want to be a Bull especially since the big boys fucked them over and they stupidly jumped in to a Bear position at the end of March playing catch-up (FOMO really). \n\nOnce everyone is talking about DOW 30,000 or SPY 400 or NASDAQ 10,000(FOMO in the opposite direction), the Institutions and Brokers will know exactly what to do. They're just waiting for our money to present itself for the taking by accumulating in one direction again. They need to cover their losses too!\n\nMy advice is just to wait. Opportunities will present themselves over time. Maybe don't just look at the stock markets all together and try to find specific sectors/commodities that have long term potential.\n\nTLDR: You'll probably go bust (SPY 1000 Calls 5/15)\n\nEdit 1: Anybody that downvotes is butt-hurt from their losses\n\nEdit 2: This post must stay at 69 upvotes, if it goes higher I'm capitulating", "created_utc": 1589143556.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gh97ya/the_market_will_move_in_the_direction_that_fucks/", "is_self": true}
