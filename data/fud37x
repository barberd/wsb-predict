{"id": "fud37x", "title": "Long Calls PTON - Peloton Earnings Play", "selftext": "Peloton earnings is 5/5. I\u2019m going long and here\u2019s why:\n\n**Part 1: Anecdotal Demand Evidence:** Let\u2019s start with some anecdotal evidence on demand for home gym equipment. Take peek at stock levels for Rogue, Titan, random amazon sellers, etc. Everything is sold out or back ordered 1+ months. For what they do have in stock, shipping is delayed because they have hit their shipping operations capacity. Peloton likely won\u2019t have issues with stock out as they likely build a huge stockpile of inventory for their massive holiday sales season  (228 revenue period ending sept 2019 vs 428 revenue period ended Dec. 2019 \u2013 huge amount of sales at end of year)\n\nDont @ me about people not dropping big cash on gym equipment during a recession. Rogue is sold out of their $7500 monster banshee rack and every other piece of overpriced equipment they sell including the $1000 concept 2 bike they distribute.\n\n[https://www.roguefitness.com/concept-2-erg-package](https://www.roguefitness.com/concept-2-erg-package)\n\n[https://www.roguefitness.com/rogue-monster-rm-8-banshee](https://www.roguefitness.com/rogue-monster-rm-8-banshee)\n\n**TLDR Part 1:** People are loading up on home gym equipment like never before - Uppies\n\n**Part 2: Revenue Conjecture:** Q2 report gave the following guidance for Q3 sales: Peloton said Third-quarter revenue of $470 million to $480. Q3 captures Jan \u2013 March. Sales probably started sky rocketing end of February into March so let\u2019s say they meet their low end target Jan \u2013 Feb and blow past in March by 50%. That puts revenue at $548 million or an increase over expected by 13%. This calculation is pure conjecture but it is supported in a few ways:\n\n* App download 5x normal: [https://seekingalpha.com/news/3555563-peloton-gains-on-report-of-download-spike](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3555563-peloton-gains-on-report-of-download-spike)\n* Social media following (Instagram) has a huge spike in march: [https://socialblade.com/instagram/user/onepeloton](https://socialblade.com/instagram/user/onepeloton)\n* Deliveries delayed:\n   * [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fke06p/long\\_calls\\_on\\_pton/fks95ll/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fke06p/long_calls_on_pton/fks95ll/?context=3)\n   * [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnku24/insider\\_sold\\_41m\\_of\\_pton\\_at\\_26\\_instead\\_of\\_buying/fla1o9s/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnku24/insider_sold_41m_of_pton_at_26_instead_of_buying/fla1o9s/?context=3)\n\nDelayed deliveries is key here and means they are exceeding the capacity of what they have resources for - means they are selling way more bikes than expected.  If the comments are true on deliveries getting pushed from standard 2 weeks to 6 weeks, they are at 3x capacity, or selling three times as many bikes per day than they expected and hired delivery drivers for.  I doubt they are 3x in every market so I'm not gonna read into that 3x number too much but it is certainly directional on demand increase and points to the fact that my 50% increase for demand in March is probably on the conservative end.\n\n**TLDR Part 2:** Social media following up, app subscribers up, deliveries backed up- points to sales up = stock uppies\n\n**Part 3: Bad News is Good News:** They recently cut tread deliveries which WSB seems to view negatively, but I believe that to be a net positive for *this* earnings report. From my readings of their quarterly reports tread is the lower margin product so all existing delivery resources are now devoted to fulfilling the huge demand on bike deliveries, the higher margin product.\n\n\"Our Connected Fitness Product gross margin decreased slightly for the three months ended December 31, 2019 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to the increasing mix of deliveries of Tread which currently carry a lower gross margin than our Bike\"- Q2 report\n\nSo same headcount resource cost for delivering, but devoted to delivering huge spike in demand on higher margin product = higher net income.  Its not specifically broken out in the earnings reports, but I don't think tread was ever a huge portion of their revenue to begin with- maybe 15-20%.  Bike is their core product and will completely offset any losses incurred from cancelling tread.\n\nAdditionally, tread deliveries went until about March 18th, so they are really only going to be missing 2 weeks of sales on this report, which could still in theory exceed the tread revenue of the previous report due to higher than expected growth of demand as tread is a fairly new product.\n\n\"As of December\u00a031, 2019, approximately 3% of our Connected Fitness Subscribers owned both a Bike and a Tread\"- Q2 report.\n\n**TLDR Part 3:** All focus has inadvertently been shifted to higher margin product and will more than offset the 2 week loss in tread sales, uppies\n\n**Part 4: Bonus Uppies:**\n\n* \u201cManufacturing Partner Acquisition - In October 2019, we completed the acquisition of one of our long-time, Taiwan-based bike manufacturing partners, Tonic Fitness Technology, Inc., or Tonic.\u201d \u2013 Q2 report\n\nCost benefits from this acquisition should start hitting the balance sheet this quarter. I\u2019m no expert but I would think that owning your supplier = paying the profit margin on manufacturing to yourself = higher margins on your existing highest margin item (bike) = higher net income. (Not to mention greater control over inventory, quality, scheduling, shipping, etc).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* ***\"Launch in Germany -*** In November 2019, we took another important step in our international expansion with the launch of Peloton in Germany. With our entry into Germany, we are in the three largest fitness markets in the world (United States, United Kingdom, and Germany). Germany also marks our first time offering non-English language content to users on our platform courtesy of our new German cycling instructor who has already begun producing classes from our temporary studio in London. To support our sales efforts in Germany, we have opened several retail showrooms across the major metropolitan areas of Germany and began a full-scale national television and digital media campaign in January 2020 to build brand and product awareness. \" -Q2 Report\n\nYeah guess what countries are also largely stuck at home?  Whatever sales PTON projected for UK and Germany when they made the Q2 report are likely blown out of the water.  For reference, the German Peloton instructor is Erik Jager. His IG followers (hauptstadttrainer on IG) are up 13% over the last 14 days and huge spike in March overall.\n\n[https://socialblade.com/instagram/user/hauptstadttrainer](https://socialblade.com/instagram/user/hauptstadttrainer)\n\nWhats a huge driver of Pton instructors following?  People buying PTON bikes and using those workouts.\n\n**TLDR part 4:** Cheaper manufacturing costs on their biggest seller \u2013 stock uppies.  Germany and UK stuck at home - huge incremental unforseen demand opportunity on top of what they projected for international.\n\n**TLDR in summary:** To me all signs point to beating revenue expectations by a double digit %. A few signs point to better earnings per share than previous quarterly reports.\n\n50% PTON 5/15 32c  - For risk balance\n\n35% PTON 5/15 35c - Bacuse the stock went to $35 before Q2 issued decreased Q3 revenue guidance so its a safe target\n\n15% PTON 5/15 40c because YOLO\n\niTs pRiCed iN", "created_utc": 1585936638.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fud37x/long_calls_pton_peloton_earnings_play/", "is_self": true}
