{"id": "gf8qf4", "title": "ZM: why the market may be substantially underestimating the upside", "selftext": "When I saw everyone shitting on Zoom as an undifferentiated hype stock at WSB, figured there may be a contrarian play, so started doing some digging. Just my view - disclosure, obviously long shares and calls, a few FDs included. Earnings coming up in early June and think there's 2-3x price appreciation potential in the next 6-12 mos. \n\nTLDR: Zoom undervalued at anything less than $200 a share as market discounting new subscribers. Sorry for the bullet formatting, I tried. \n\nHigh level thesis: \n*\tMarket underestimating the impact of daily participants growth from 10MM/day at end of 2019 to 300MM/day as of early April\n*        \tWhile education and other venues have received free access, this does not explain the broader growth. There are 60-70MM people in US at school age. Assuming 25% using Zoom at 5x instances a day, that yields 80-100MM of the 290MM growth from education\n*      \tBoth new and existing enterprise Zoom users have likely rapidly increased adoption in the last 90 days, adding more paying users per company than previously assumed (e.g., a firm with 50 employees that may have shared 4-5 licenses or used a free version is now ramping usage)\n*\tHigh free cash flow, subscription revenue business provides visibility into earnings potential on an annualized, runrate basis\n*      \tSubscription based model that is a small cost per employee, especially compared to traveling for in person meetings (e.g., annual subscription a fraction of the cost of one business trip per year)\n*      \tMarket will price ZM on a quarterly runrate basis derived from paying users, which will be reported in early June along with MD&A on new users through that date\n*\tContinued COVID issues will drive subscription and paying user growth\n*      \tEarly state reopenings will drive companies to delay return to work and travel due to risks of virus continuing to circulate (e.g., many financial firms banning travel until 2021); consensus for a 2nd wave in the 2H of 2021\n*      \tDespite reopenings, dual income households unable to go to work due to childcare constraints as schools, daycares, and camps closed until the fall or beyond\n*      \tCOVID accelerating long term shift toward remote working; commercial air travel to remain challenged for next 6-12 months (Evercore surveys point to investors\u2019 belief that business travel does not recover until 2H2021) further entrenching people being comfortable working from home or doing remote meetings\n*\tCompetitive moat built through brand, GUI, and early mover advantage\n*      \tZoom is a name brand in the business community; technology not just an app but becomes entrenched in conference room set-ups, internal company procedures and IT stack\n*      \tCost of service is de minimis for recent competitive activity from Google or Facebook to matter ($120/user/year not worth behavioral change/shift requirements)\n*      \tZM preferred due to GUI, user friendliness (prior to it being banned, Google\u2019s own employees overwhelmingly preferred Zoom and company considered buying Zoom)\n*      \tOther larger tech companies have challenges in switching Zoom users (FB: personal privacy and bridge to enterprise applications; GOOG: niche user base and need to be in GOOG ecosystem; MSFT: clunky user interface embedded in complex Teams universe, slow to roll out upgrades)\n\nIn terms of the risks / bear case for the story, common questions and concerns are the following:\n\n*\tValuation too high: \u201c1000 PE,\u201d \u201cridiculous revenue multiple\u201d to be addressed shortly. Net net there is visibility into near term runrate $2B in annualized EBITDA, which at a 50x multiple (appropriate given growth), implies substantial price upside\n*\t\u201cMuh competition\u201d: addressed above. Solutions provided by FB are geared toward social users (who are not paying and ZM doesn\u2019t want anyway); MSFT is too clunky and ZM viewed as a complementary application; GOOG: not everyone wants a gmail account and even Google\u2019s own employees prefer Zoom. Thankfully for the bull case, all these threats are now out in the open and \u201cpriced in\u201d\n*\tAll the growth will go away post COVID: 1) COVID not going away anytime soon (see: second wave, mutations, too early openings, residual fears; 2) post conversion, video conferencing will still be used, particularly to save on corporate travel and will replace conference calls that were done prior to COVID. Additionally, companies will want this capability in place for risk mitigation/business continuity. Given this, the subscription users will stay in place and continue to convert from free users 3) the education (K-12/college) users who will go away weren\u2019t paying and will plant seeds for future growth as they join the workforce 4) the growth in users was 30x in the course of 30-60 days\n*\t\u201cMuh security concerns and Zoom bombing\u201d: acquisition of KeyBase + Eric\u2019s 90 day plan appears to be allaying concerns. Separately, the security concerns appear to be hyped up by competitors vs. actual threats \u2013 a number of reputable firms continue to onboard Zoom and NYC schools has reversed its decision. Just note that FB channeled Russian hackers on its platform that changed the outcome of US elections and appears to not effect its valuation. \n\nValuation: the gutcheck \u2013 stock has appreciated ~2x pre-COVID though daily participants have grown 30x. All else being equal, market is discounting a substantial portion of upside growth. However, it is important to note that FYQ2 (the next quarter being reported for period ending 4/30) will not nearly reflect the runrate performance given most of the recent surge happened late in the quarter. \n\n*\tContext of where we are and what we know about the numbers\n**\tIn the most recent quarter ending January, Zoom generated $188MM in revenue and $10MM of EBITDA. It is important to note that Zoom operates at 82-83% gross margin (that means each incremental dollar generates 80 cents of profit or EBITDA assuming no scale up of backoffice and overhead). Said differently, it is very cheap for Zoom to support incremental user growth as is with most software/subscription businesses\n**\tOn an annualized basis pre-COVID, Zoom was generating roughly $800MM in revenue and $40MM of EBITDA. The low EBITDA margins are due to the SG&A/overhead that has yet to be (but soon will be) leveraged\n**\tExiting the most recent quarter, Zoom had 10MM daily participants, which translates into ~$75 of annualized revenue per daily participant (includes both paying and non-paying participants). Note that this 10MM includes those who used the platform for free prior to COVID, so if the same mix of paying and non-paying participants continued, you\u2019d see an unbelievably large ramp in revenue and earnings\n**\tZoom grew to 200MM daily participants in early April, then 300MM toward the end of April\n**\tObviously, you can\u2019t just take the 300MM x $75 a year factor, which would translate into $24B in annualized revenue \u2013 it is likely a larger percentage of free users joined, including college and K-12 students. The question is what %? That\u2019s what I will lay out below. \n\n*\t Valuing the growth potential \u2013 anything less than $200/share is drastically undervaluing Zoom\n**\tThe question is then of the 290MM new daily participants, how closely does that match to the profile of the preexisting 10MM daily participants. That is what we will then apply the $80/annualized revenue figure\n**\tBeing conservative, let\u2019s just assume 20%. That implies 58MM out of the 290MM new daily participants that match the mix of paying/non-paying as pre-COVID users and that the rest of the 230MM will not pay at all\n**\tThat yields to an INCREMENTAL annualized revenue figure of $4.4B ($75/year x 58MM)\n**\tBack to our gross margin point, Zoom generates 82-83% gross margins\n**\tInstead of doing a straight calculation on that as flow through, let\u2019s assume another 20-25% cost on the incremental revenue in additional SG&A as well as costs to serve the incremental free users\n**\t$4.4B x 60% = $2.2B in annualized operating profit (EBITDA)\n**\tSo how do we value ZM on that basis? Question is comparable TEV / EBITDA multiples for fast growing software/SAAS businesses:\n***\tCRM: 55x LTM EBITDA (35% revenue growth), 8x revenue (more mature, lower margin biz)\n***   TDOC: not profitable; 20x LTM Revenue\n***\tDOCU: not profitable, 20x LTM Revenue\n***\tTWLO: not profitable, 17x LTM Revenue\n**\tAssuming a 15x revenue multiple for ZM on runrate revenue ($5B total runrate) = $75B TEV, or $250 share price on 300M shares\n***\tAssuming a 50x EBITDA multiple like CRM: $108B TEV, or $360 share price\n***\tAssuming a 30x EBITDA multiple: $65B TEV, $215 share price\n**\tNow, assume 50x EBITDA and what the value would be if greater than 20% of the new users looked like the profile of Zoom\u2019s existing users, should it be 30 or 50%: \n***\t30%: $580/share at 50x EBITDA, $350/share at 30x\n***\t50%: $1,015/share at 50x, $600/share at 30x, $400/share at 20x (at larger TEV, multiple will be lower as more growth has been realized\n\nSo there you have it.
