P/C ratio of .27 (kinda low I think maybe) lots of interest in 40c. This would place it right where it was before the nasdaqs and the dows took a fat poo poo pee pee. Today some may 1 40c being bought up, as well as a large high volume green dick at open making me think that some men on wall street are looking into this. The short dated weekly calls arouse me especially because earnings are pre market tomorrow. IV is nice and low.\n\nTL;DR PFE 40c whichever date you broke asses can afford to buy 10 of.\n\nAlso, bonus fun play if you're a zoomer who loves lisa su babey from AMD. MRVL is AMDs side piece bitch. If you're bullish on AMD but poor check them out.", "created_utc": 1587999657.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g92amv/unusual_options_activity_pfe/", "is_self": true}
