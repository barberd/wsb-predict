{"id": "chufc6", "title": "Market discussion going into the weekend", "selftext": "Few variables in play. They\u2019re like sharks swimming around waiting to bite your fucking arm off. If you\u2019re not looking. \n\nThe debt ceiling that just passed the house\n\nFucking Draghi and the ECB\n\nGDP numbers tomorrow\n\nLightzer and gang flying to China on Monday\n\nAnd then, Fed day. 25 or 50 (most likely 25) \n\nDebt ceiling increase - bullish or bearish on markets? Crisis averted, yea. But is this inflationary or deflationary since they essentially just stole mommy and daddy\u2019s credit card. Again. Does the dollar fall on this? How is it on equities? \n\nECB - still trying to digest what the fuck these Europeans are doing. It\u2019s like the fucking twilight zone over there (well, everywhere really). They didn\u2019t cut rates but maybe will in the future? Did he pump fake the fuck outta the markets today or what? Metals down, dollar up. \n\nGDP numbers - does this really matter? Unless it\u2019s something extreme will it still be somewhat bad news is good news? \n\nChina trade negotiations - lightzer and gang go to China, it\u2019s like an autistic but also really smart bill and ted. When will news leak of progress if any leak? And how much of an affect will it have on markets? \n\nAnd last but not least, Fed Day - ok, i\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re all cocked and loaded for 25 basis points. BUT, will the market go full trust fund baby that can\u2019t go to the hamptons when or if Powell says this won\u2019t be a full easing cycle? If we do on the outside chance get 50 basis points will it be freaky friday or will we rally? We\u2019re already showing relative weakness with the mixed earnings, especially after today and Boeing, Tesla, CAT, and all those other motherfuckers eating it. I\u2019m just wondering and trying to prep of this is the catalyst to pull the rug out from under us. \n\nWhat say the collective autism channel?", "created_utc": 1564093145, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/chufc6/market_discussion_going_into_the_weekend/", "is_self": true}
