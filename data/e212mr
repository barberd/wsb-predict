Structurally similar to existing antipsychotics but targeting the dopamine d1 receptor and other shit.\n\nPros is that it has less side-affects like weight gain. So schizos will jump on this coz nobody wanna look fat.\n\nStock has gotten very high volume lately. See this\n\n[Long put spread](https://twitter.com/EdenRahim/status/1198982657528324096?s=09)\n\nAbout 20k bear put spread yesterday. Looking like someone is protecting larger position.
