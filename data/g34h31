I found that strange during a peace time lock down and figured these guys would get a much needed break. \n\nIf you think our military is weak I will let you know we have technology and weapons that would make your hair stand up on the back of your neck. \n\nNow let\u2019s jump back to the 70\u2019s where the ME is the worlds oil supplier and the OPEC cartel is running us in to the ground. We \u201cbefriend\u201d them and by giving them lots of money. We actually gave them the first US mint press to every leave the treasury in history. \n\nWe slowly gained control with money over the oil, then  we had to get worried about China coming back those commie f*cks along with the Russians. They were going to become huge problems with nukes and technology in the future. \n\nThose countries been in the news lately? We printed money to infinity but we are the peg currency for the world. China has printed more money than any government including Zimbabwe at this point and they are going tits up. \n\nLet me explain: if we made the paper US dollar illegal, just like we make gold illegal 100 years ago, that would mean tha the dollar that we have been printing is not worthless, it\u2019s contraband. \n\nThe secret service tracks money. Remember those Blue Face Hunnids? Those are the easiest tracked currencies ever made. Bitcoin? Every illegal transaction has a time stamp and amount and that info is public. The NSA is recording every phone call in the world right now and the criminals, drug dealers, human traffickers, and terrorist networks can\u2019t operate without cash and being connected. How do you think Mexican supply chains for drugs are doing\nright now? Do you think they are smart enough to not be tracked by the NSA. \n\nMy prediction: My special forces buddies haven\u2019t spoken to me in months. They all have top secret security clearances so 99% of what they know that can\u2019t tell me or anyone anyway. I think they are preparing to go in and end the evil that has ravaged America for so long. \n\nThe second paper currency is declared illegal navy seals will be visiting drug warehouses filled with cash and kill enemy combatants holding illegal treasury notes property of Uncle Sam. If you are a terrorist in another country a tomahawk missile will hit your f*cking forehead from 30,000 feet. Every drug dealer in America\u2019s supply chain will go to prison. Money laundering laws are the strictest in US history. \n\nNow, let\u2019s get back to our new \u201cfriendly\u2019 communists that killed 100 million people last century. \n\nChina and Russia are printing money fighting over oil and I just told you oil isn\u2019t worth anything. \n\nThe MBS bond market is about to go up in smoke and will make 07 look like child\u2019s play. Now we couldn\u2019t give it all to our communist friends but we tried, sorry DB you\u2019re idiots. \n\nSo China has bankrupted themselves following is the arrogant commies they are right off a cliff. \n\nWe know where every one of their citizens are in real time and know their face and identity. Now do you get why google was helping them spy on their own citizens? They let us build a commie tracking system and if someone says the CCP out loud they will be killed by us immediately. Forever. \n\nWe just won WW3 and no one even knows we were playing. Especially the Chinese and Russians. They are now the most over leveraged debt pools in the world. \n\nHow are we doing? We are buying up assets like gold, oil, private label bonds, with WORTHLESS paper and about to do the greatest magic show of all time to USDe. If you make a million in your brokerage you\u2019re good! If you sell drugs, you\u2019re going to a dark place for a long time or the lights are about to be shut off by the Chris Kyle\u2019s of the world. \n\nWhy do you think JPM moved to a standard where you can only do a loan with chase if you are already a client? Because you need to have legal currency in the bank electronically. \n\nCongrats guys, we now have surveillance on our commie enemies 24/7, 365 and they are bankrupt. They will sign on the line that is dotted or they will all die immediately. It took Japan a while to catch on to, but they surrendered when we needed two cities in 15 minutes. Because everyone since the British has surrendered to us and we don\u2019t f*cking lose. \n\nAmerica\u2019s weak? We just took out every evil organization and government in the world and they have NO clue. Now that\u2019s some fucking monopoly.\n\nIt\u2019s going to get worse before it gets better but know that we won and will be able to fix everything fucked very quickly....because our enemies are holding the bag. \n\nUSA USA USA \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8", "created_utc": 1587138319.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g34h31/how_we_just_won_ww3/", "is_self": true}
