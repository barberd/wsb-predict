{"id": "f3hcur", "title": "Roast me if you want but I think Webull is robbing me", "selftext": "I\u2019m fairly new to selling options but I\u2019ve had my share different answers on when the premium would be reflected on my net account value (since it isn\u2019t added to my account when I first sell it)\n\nAfter being tired of receiving conflicting answers on the reddit/internet I called directly Webull customer service - their answer was quite simple. When the option is closed or when it expires out of the money you will receive the premium.\n\nI took the answer as truth and in real time (I recorded my phone screen), I closed an option for a profit over $300.  \n\nMy Net account value did not increase.\nMy cash balance did not increase either.\n\nI\u2019m fact my net account and cash balance decreased since I spend $45 to close out my position even though it was for a \u201cprofit\u201d\n\nTo summarize, I sell an option then the premium is  not reflected on my net account value. Customer service says it will only be added once the option is closed. I proceed to close an option for profit and the premium gains are not reflected on my net account value. Customer service says they don\u2019t understand either and I have to call back tomorrow.\n\nI am quite concerned here for everyone - maybe it is only me OR my guess is that is a glitch when Margin is in play (the profits just reduce your margin balance: meaning it goes from -$800 to -$500 never actually receiving the profits) \n\nThat sounds like stupidly huge glitch but I don\u2019t know how else to explain it and neither can customer service. I have to call them back. \n\nRegardless of the outcome I will be moving my money out of the platform and I advice everyone to look into this if they want to keep using Webull for trading options", "created_utc": 1581629855, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3hcur/roast_me_if_you_want_but_i_think_webull_is/", "is_self": true}
