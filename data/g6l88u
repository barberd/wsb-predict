Almost all the retailers I work with are up +50% on sales, some of them closer to +90%. My company is pretty much flat because we lost a fuck ton of food service business(restaurants, hotels, schools, ect). People aren't consuming less food, all of that business from the food service sector is going to retailers. They've pretty much had two months worth of Thanksgiving(big retail holiday) business. \n\nI read somewhere(low quality DD) that Kroger's CEO was quoted saying they're up 30% on sales, my guess is that they're up a lot more than that. Regardless, +30% in sales doesn't look priced in to me.\n\nNot holding a heavy position yet because I could see the market as a whole dropping in the short term.\n\nAveraging into 5/29 $32c's and 6/19 $34/35c's", "created_utc": 1587642504.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6l88u/kroger_should_smash_earnings/", "is_self": true}
