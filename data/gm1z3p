Sold half on Friday with 150% gain and bought in 6/19 115c. Today it moons and the 6/19 110c got 500% gain, 150c got 200% gain. I continued to sell half already.\n\nSame applies to HD and NEWR. Got decent gains and sold half. I realized that selling half and keeping half is a good way to keep yourself mentally stable; otherwise you would always regret for losing too much by diamond hands or gaining too little by paper hands.", "created_utc": 1589810418.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gm1z3p/hail_disney_dis_gain_porn/", "is_self": true}
