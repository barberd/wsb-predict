(look to Italy, we are following them in cases & they have more hospital beds than us)\n\nTesting has been non-existent! West Virginia has tested only 80 people, Texas has only tested \\~300. \n\nWhat is insane is Italy tested an entire city and found **75%** of **confirmed cases show no symptoms!!! The USA is about to get hit hard.**\n\nEvery store is shutting down, theaters closed, it all is coming to a halt. \n\n**We are moving straight into a recession:**\n\nThe economy is halted & nobody is allowed to shop or go out, things are going to plummet, Goldman Sachs & every other bank now sees a recession as the base case. \n\nAdvertising spend is non-existent and people are being laid off in the coming days.  Unemployment numbers last week were already worse than expected.\n\nTL-DR: **Buy $200 PUTS --> 30-60 days away!** (also, side note: the only way this might not happen is if Trump hands out $$$ to everyone, in that case, you get refunded money if the puts didn't work out) -- It's a win-win - \n\n[current positions if curious](https://preview.redd.it/80jxu863k9n41.png?width=423&format=png&auto=webp&s=29e73bbef776dc35c7a1f975fb5cc965fa639ca4)", "created_utc": 1584464286.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fk8oxk/the_market_can_only_go_down_from_here/", "is_self": true}
