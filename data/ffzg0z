I did a little digging around and discovered that Lysol is manufactured by a company called Reckitt Benckiser which is on the London Stock Exchange and trades adr's in the US. Interestingly enough, Reckitt Benckiser was tanking well prior to the coronavircus pandemic and posted a $6.5 billion loss in their most recent financials due to buying a subpar baby formula company. The insane levels of Lysol sales may just turn this baby around and lead to massive tendies in the same manner it has for the medical mask companies.  \n [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-27/reckitt-benckiser-takes-6-5-billion-charge-over-formula-deal](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-27/reckitt-benckiser-takes-6-5-billion-charge-over-formula-deal)", "created_utc": 1583779275.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffzg0z/people_are_going_berserk_buying_disinfectants/", "is_self": true}
