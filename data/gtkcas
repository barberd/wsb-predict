If you like gambling and winning, then you'll like $ENZ. $ENZ is the $5 straight flush shit bet, and we're gonna hit it. It's time we get behind $ENZ before they board the board the rocket \ud83d\ude80\n\n*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and this is entirely my opinion. The numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up. Do your own research, figure out for yourself if you're in or out.*\n\nEverybody is fixated on the vaccine rn, think $MRNA's crazy action. Scrubbing the data, vaccines are at least a year out. Donnie Pump and the news completely disregard [actual results](https://www.statnews.com/2020/05/19/vaccine-experts-say-moderna-didnt-produce-data-critical-to-assessing-covid-19-vaccine/) from vaccine trials from companies like $MRNA. This past week, the $MRNA bubble popped, and the market finally realized that. The pumpers took their tendies. Now the market is looking for other plays bc it knows vaccines are gonna be harder to pump.\n\n[$MRNA fake news finally catches up](https://preview.redd.it/czza7ovtdy151.png?width=1292&format=png&auto=webp&s=aaf7f819d0dba6d90999f019dd0215d39e8b9b64)\n\nQuick tests inbound. They're available sooner than vaccines and they'll profit sooner and more reliably because of it. A bunch of these tests received emergency use authorization from the FDA, $ENZ is one of them as of May 20, 2020. ENZ got a little pop on this news for their [diagnostic test](https://www.enzo.com/corporate/press-releases/enzo-announces-issuance-of-us-patent-for-methods-of-using-proprietary-compound-sk1-i-in-patients-exploring-options-for-development-as-a-potential-treatment-for-covid-19-enzo) and [antibody test](https://www.enzo.com/corporate/press-releases/enzo-biochem-launches-proprietary-test-for-detection-of-coronavirus-sars-cov-2-igg-antibody-under-fdas-emergency-use-authorization) released near Apr 23 and May 20, respectively.\n\n[ENZ small pops on big news](https://preview.redd.it/997w4cnody151.png?width=1294&format=png&auto=webp&s=ecf814e5fee9e6a68687449c821faaa911e4f0f8)\n\nAs far as quick test competitors, we've got:\n\n* $ABT's ID NOW - 15 minute turnaround is great, but [15% false negative is terrible](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-informs-public-about-possible-accuracy-concerns-with-abbott-id-now-point-of-care-test-301059882.html). Already popped.\n* $RHHBY (Roche) - actually an antibody test competitor, but they've got 300B market cap compared to ENZ's 140M. They're not gonna move like $ENZ. Already popped, priced in.\n* Diasorin Simplexa - worse false negative rate than ID NOW, dunno how to trade it anyways\n* Cepheid, owned by Danaher ($DHR) - another worthy competitor. Also huge 120B market cap, already priced in.\n* $CODX - below\n\nCheck out $CODX. This mf is selling $10 tests and getting crack-ass analysts to give it a [$35 price estimates](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/05/28/2040258/0/en/Co-Diagnostics-NASDAQ-CODX-Analysts-Set-Price-Target-Between-30-and-36.html). If you're into it, go for it, but that puts them at $1B+ mkt cap. Do some math on their reports:\n\n>The company claims in its most recent news release that the [gross margins for its Logix Smart Covid-19 tests](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1692415/000149315220008931/ex99-1.htm) are extremely high at 71%. It also says that it is preparing to manufacture 20 million tests \u201cto fill existing and expected orders in the near future.\u201d\n\nEven if these guys tested 10% of US and Europe population (reckless penetration estimate), that's $760M revenue and $539M profit. Nevertheless, I'm a retard and bought 19/25c 6/19 spreads on $CODX two weeks ago after it came back to earth, and they're flatlining.\n\n[CODX two spikes after emergency use approval \\(Feb\\) and distribution news \\(May\\)](https://preview.redd.it/q7xdfbi9ey151.png?width=1290&format=png&auto=webp&s=11b254fefdd706c61a0104855073c7c5060245a2)\n\n$ENZ will be on a similar path as $CODX once their tests gain the traction and attention they deserve\n\nEverything is priced in, except ENZ. Maybe there are other small companies working on COVID tests or vaccines, but ENZ is the next champ.\n\n$ENZ isn't even on Seeking Alpha's radar yet for [COVID plays](https://imgur.com/a/ivSd5Nm) so get in while the spaceship is still fueling under $5/share with a sub $150M mkt cap.\n\n**TL;DR** \\- $ENZ's [diagnostic test](https://www.enzo.com/corporate/press-releases/enzo-announces-issuance-of-us-patent-for-methods-of-using-proprietary-compound-sk1-i-in-patients-exploring-options-for-development-as-a-potential-treatment-for-covid-19-enzo), [antibody test](https://www.enzo.com/corporate/press-releases/enzo-biochem-launches-proprietary-test-for-detection-of-coronavirus-sars-cov-2-igg-antibody-under-fdas-emergency-use-authorization), and [eventual treatment](https://www.enzo.com/corporate/press-releases/enzo-biochem-launches-proprietary-covid-19-diagnostic-test-under-fdas-emergency-use-authorization) will soon gain traction when they start announcing distribution deals for their better COVID-19 tests. Their product's success is suppressed by today's ineffective quick tests and unpromising vaccines. Once the clouds clear, this lil guy will have lift off.\n\nThere is literally no option volume yet and call open interest is \\~2000. If you're retarded enough to buy options (and for the bots) IDFK\n\n$ENZ 8/16 5c or $ENZ 1/1 7.5c\n\nFor the love of fuck, get shares and just buy in bunches of 100. I'm looking for 300% gains min, but I'll probably death grip this shit until EOY or I see 500%. If that happens, I'll boof the tendies. Open to ideas.\n\nMy average share cost is $2.88, and I've got 10,000 shares. If you're a lil' bitch boy, biotech swings are guh as fuck sometimes, and this probably not for you.
