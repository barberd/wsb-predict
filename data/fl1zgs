Millions of young people gave their lives in WWI, WWII, Vietnam, Korean War, Gulf War, Afghanistan, & Iraq. And in the earlier wars, Americans sacrificed. They didn't ask for handouts. But now, at the first sign of trouble everybody has their hand out. How the hell did this happen?\nI'm all for lending a hand but why are corporations asking for handouts? Large corporations don't deserve handouts especially the ones who have out-sourced American jobs, screwed over Americans in every which way, don't pay taxes by hiding profits through off-shore tax shelters, moved HQs to foreign countries to get out of paying taxes, utilized every loophole to follow the letter of the law instead of the intent, or have already started to let people go even though they make 100M in profits. I'm writing about large corporations, not the small businesses which are dying because of the large corporations.\n\nOne of the things that the govt did yesterday by agreeing to pay monies to regular people, I think, is to say, \"hey we gave you money so we're going to give money to the airlines, casinos, cruise operators, theaters, media companies, etc.\" They are giving people $2000. That might seem like a lot of money but if you think about it, it's not alot. It's enough for just a month and this virus is not going away in a month.\n\nWe know unemployment is going up, twitter \"laid off\", and people will be desperate which leads to desperate actions...Is it possible that shit can really hit the fan?\n\nIs that why CEOs are ultra rich individuals are looking to get out of the USA? \n\nyour two cents...any sociologists, philo, pscyh, or human naturist?\n\nTDRL : NOC JAN21 520C    UUP  AUG20  30C   **I am not your financial adviser and these are my plays and SHOULD NOT BE COPIED SINCE THEY SHOULD NOT MOVE. IF THEY DO WE ARE SCREWED.**\n\nSPY ITM Any Short term Put for quick swing (Watch out for theta though)", "created_utc": 1584583709.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fl1zgs/coming_apocalypse_riots_fires_looting_breakdown/", "is_self": true}
