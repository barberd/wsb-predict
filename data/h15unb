I have 7 of them and want them gone but because of the low price they can only sell in 5 cent increments. So I can only put my sell order in for .05 and not .01.\n\nI'm now very afraid that they will expire and I'll end up having to fulfill the contract and end up negative in my account. I'm not sure if this is how it works (Autist \u2714).\n\nHow do I get out of this position??\n\n**Edit** No longer living a life a fear.
