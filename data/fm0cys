{"id": "fm0cys", "title": "DD: SPY End of Month Rally", "selftext": "There  is growing speculation of a large market rally towards End of Quarter  (March) due to Pension Funds re-balancing funds.  Estimates $150-200B in  flows to stocks. Currently more than $1T in money market funds on the  sideline.\n\n**KEY QUOTE FROM TWEET:**\n\n>With  this flow generally starting roughly 5-days before month end and   peaking at the end of the month, it should build by mid next week.\n\n[https://twitter.com/themarketear/status/1240964553858564097](https://twitter.com/themarketear/status/1240964553858564097)\n\n[https://twitter.com/themarketear/status/1241017721430716417](https://twitter.com/themarketear/status/1241017721430716417)\n\nTLDR:  Monday may still be bloody, but watch out for an aggressive rally into  end of month from the big boys. In fact, an extra bloody Monday makes  this call even stronger. Position Accordingly.\n\n\\*AFTER BLOODY MONDAY\\* SPY 260C 4/17+\n\nEDIT: To be clear, I'm not calling this a major reversal of the down trend, the end of the bear, or anything like that. **I'm talking about a week long counter-play into the end of the month**.  Then stocks go back down. \n\nTo each their own.", "created_utc": 1584730080.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fm0cys/dd_spy_end_of_month_rally/", "is_self": true}
