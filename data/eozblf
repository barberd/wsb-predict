{"id": "eozblf", "title": "Long BYND. Crypto confirms", "selftext": "Hola, fellow autists! Now that BYND is all the hype again, I figured I would make my contribution since I did not post my gains from BYNDs previous bull run. Since the market will go up infintely, BYND couldn't have picked a better time to start pumping. Anyway, I have identified a 1:1 correlation in BYND and BTC (Bitcoin...no shit) from early 2019. The charts are nearly identical and the time frames almost begin at the exact same month only separated by a year. This is clearly not a coincidence. The high price seen earlier today was a bit of an overshot, but this does justify the correction.\n\nGiven the correlation, the price can be calculated to be $162 in about 85 days (4/8/2020). There will be a bit of consolidation between here and there so plan your call and put options accordingly. In the near term, price should consolidate at current levels and in about 37 days will rip to around 150 and then only a month til moon! Any critiques on this technical analysis would be greatly appreciated.
