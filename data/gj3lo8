{"id": "gj3lo8", "title": "Home Depot earnings May 19", "selftext": "We\u2019ve seen lots of anecdotal reports of Home Depot locations being quite busy.\n\nAre they really selling more or are they just busier due to the changes in consumer behavior? (Lines outside, more online orders for pickup, low ticket DIYers).\n\nEveryone is stuck at home and doing home remodels so they go to HD to get paint or gardening supplies. But high dollar sales come from contractors / professionals and appliances, both of which are likely to be lower.\n\nA few Realtors in my area (Central Texas) said that home sales are still strong but there\u2019s also a lot fewer homes coming on the market.\n\nWe know March existing home sales were down 8.5%. April existing home sales will be out after earnings. \n\nPeople don\u2019t want to list a home they are living in and have sick people walk through it for showings. Fewer big companies hiring mean fewer people moving cities. \n\nFewer home sales mean fewer big remodels by contractors. \n\nDIYers might make a store look busy, but can they compensate for a steep decline in contractor sales? \n\nAre these bored DIYers going to also pick up the slack for the 40% of people earning under 40K that Powell said lost their jobs? \n\nAre those people going to continue to replace big ticket appliances? \n\nOverall I think the bad news will hit the stock hard if busy stores don\u2019t translate into high ticket sales. With HD close to all time highs as we enter a depressed real estate market, I think there\u2019s good downside since everyone is expecting great earnings due to the store being \u201cbusy\u201d\n\n\nConsidering some longer dates puts but looking for your thoughts. \n\nAnyone work at local Home Depot store that can confirm actual product sales mix? Appliances? Big construction? Professional contractor sales?\n\nMore people buying paint and mulch doesn\u2019t mean more $$$.\n\nMay 22, 220p\nJuly 19, 200p", "created_utc": 1589391426.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gj3lo8/home_depot_earnings_may_19/", "is_self": true}
