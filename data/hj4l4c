{"id": "hj4l4c", "title": "It's late and its time for a little TA", "selftext": "Yeah, sorry, this is two days late, but there may still be something to play.  Travel Centers of America (TA) manages a ton of truck stops off of interstates.  They've been having difficulty despite cheap oil prices, and AMZN, WMT, KR, & TGT running truckloads of goods nonstop to stores and people stuck at home.  They recently had an 8:1 reverse split, so that $15.40 price is actually closer to $1.925.  Even more recently (2 days ago), they put out an 8-K announcing a new $75 million equity offering for renovations and refurbishments.  As expected with any dilution, this has tanked the stock.\n\nTheir corporate structure is actually owned by another company, Hospitality Properties Trust (HPT), which has milked this cash cow till the tits dried up.  HPT performed a sale-leaseback in 2015, and while there's still a ton on real estate on the books, most of these properties are usually in BFE areas, so the resale value can be limited.\n\nAny ways, there's been a large drop over the past few days, and some unusual volume on TA200717P15.  During a recent run, it found support at $8 (adjusted), and, prior to a recent pop, had resistance at $19 (adjusted).\n\nMay still be time to get in and ride this down to the recent support.  RSI(14) is 43.7, so not quite oversold, and MACD is falling like a rock with no crossover yet in sight.  Check in after 7/15, and there may be some upside for the remaining months.  It'll likely rebound, but not for at least a few months.  Later on, the TA201218C17.5 may be a decent call once IV has simmered down from the recent announcement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\--Edit:  calls, support, resistance, rsi, macd", "created_utc": 1593583196.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hj4l4c/its_late_and_its_time_for_a_little_ta/", "is_self": true}
