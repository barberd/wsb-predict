{"id": "frzkec", "title": "Top of this bounce is Thursday", "selftext": "Very scientific DD says the top of this bounce is Thursday and next leg down starts Friday. Why? SPY gapped down Feb 24, tested the trendline and resumed the plummeting. From there we saw 5 days downtrend and 3 uptrend, followed by another 13 day downtrend to the bottom. Fib sequence is 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,... so 5 down, 3 up, 13 down.... 8 up! Red days, green days in between doesn't matter. Thursday will be the top.\n\nAlso, the buying volume on this run up is weakening. Fewer and fewer are buying it up at these prices.\n\nYou'll see. Could happen sooner, but Friday the latest your puts will print.\n\nEdit: Wait! extending the fib sequence out a bit, next numbers are 34, 55 and 89! This means that after the next leg down of 34 days and the following uptrend of 21 days, we'll see a downtrend of 89 days!
