{"id": "b216az", "title": "Psychology of Trading!", "selftext": "Things I have learned about trading over the years... \n\nGoing into ever trade the plan was to make the most amount of money \ud83d\udcb0... *A day or two later*, the market moves and now your *either A) down a lot and wondering how to make back/not lose* your money *or B) wounding if you should take profit.* \n\nWould you say that this scenario is most traders? \n\n\n*Do hedge funds and huge investors go threw similar psychology as retail traders?*\n\nCould we use psychology as TA? \n\nAlso timing the market on a macro level is very difficult: markets can stay irrational for very long times. Also you need to understand who wants a recession and who doesn\u2019t... for example the president of the USA probably doesn\u2019t want a recession while he\u2019s in office or even after 2 years of leaving for the risk of looking like a bad president and lack of control. Sometimes *people cheat* this can really change macroeconomics making it harder to predict recessions. Using options which are designed as insurance (hedge/protect or make high levered bets) ; And basic understanding of options put options should be more expensive because more people \u201cexpect a recession\u201d well why is it every time the market dips people\u2019s first thought is a \u201crecession coming?\u201d Recessions have the same exact chance of happing yesterday as today the only difference is news and interpretation. So sell puts when stocks \u201cdip\u201d or fear picks up and CNBC brings on experts. Warren Buffett uses this strategy bc of \u201chigh priced premiums do to iv and expectations.\u201d If you are wondering what causes recessions or wonder when the next one is coming... we\u2019ll then your like a lot of people too. The thing about the stock market it\u2019s not necessarily about IQ scores and intelligence it\u2019s actually not often logical thinking and reasoning behind the stock market. Literally in the name it says market. In the word market it means trade/deals everyone thinks they have the next \u201cbig thing\u201d or \u201cfull proof plan\u201d chances are your exact thought at that moment was thought of by a 16 year old or 50 year old already and they too figured it wouldn\u2019t work and they are onto the next \u201cplan.\u201d My theory about the stock market is invest for the longterm in a simple S&amp;p500 ETF for your main account, and have a speculation account. Understand and think simply minded sometimes isn\u2019t a bad thing and thinking \u201ccrazy\u201d also can work, that\u2019s what makes a market. The difference in opinions resulting in arguing and people placing trades. I would say 5,000$ is enough for a speculative account and sell premium on spy puts during pull backs; because chances are iv and expectations are way to high and the reason for \u201cdip\u201d isn\u2019t known exactly and not completely clear and doesn\u2019t make sense. So sell premium on spy puts and then use that profit to make DD driven high risk high reward plays using options. Understand the mix and use case of leaps, weeklies, and monthlies. Also understand that options are moment to go to zero and iv/premium paid is for insurance/ cover the rare  occurrence. Hence I would say sell premium and save that profit until you have a play that you think is under priced and has a more logical chance of happing (options display POP the chance of being profitable so if it says 20% but you feel it realistically could happen like a China and USA trade deal take it) satirically this will net a very thing profit margin (selling premium medium gains and then losses on the gambling plays) but however this should result in profit but might be rather *BORING* for some. \n", "created_utc": 1552794458, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b216az/psychology_of_trading/", "is_self": true}
