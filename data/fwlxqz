Will the true death toll ever be released? Deaths won't affect the economy, but the length of the lockdowns will - and higher death tolls will lengthen the lockdowns as the true danger of the virus is revealed. \n\nI'm sorry you read this far. The economy, and fundamentals, do not affect equity prices.\n\n SPY 5/1 340 C\n\nEDIT: Normal deaths at home per day in NYC is 20-25, NOT 50", "created_utc": 1586271493.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fwlxqz/coronavirus_deaths_being_vastly_underreported/", "is_self": true}
