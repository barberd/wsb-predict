But, today I tried to feed him and he kept decapitating the worms and spewing their filth on the walls of the cage, murdering them in cold blood. I don\u2019t know what is coming but I\u2019m scared. I have sold all options and am sitting in my bathroom with my AR locked and loaded in case Powell is coming.\n\n[Mr. Gordon and his victims](https://imgur.com/NHggqBL)", "created_utc": 1589237309.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghyd71/something_strange_is_happening_to_gordon/", "is_self": true}
