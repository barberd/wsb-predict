Zillow. \n\nI flipped for a $100k gain in 15 minutes when this crashed, and am about to do it again. \n\n$50k of 3/20 $35 Puts\n\nThis is headed to $25 next week. \n\n[Proof](https://imgur.com/gallery/ld18AJV)\n\nEdit:\n\nA gentle reminder, if you\u2019re going to freak out with every $ move and sell, then you probably shouldn\u2019t be playing this game. \ud83d\udc8e hands fellas.\n\nEdit #2:\n\nEVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU is up right now.  If you NEED the money, take it. There is NO SHAME in taking profits. I'm getting flooded with DMs asking if you should sell.  If you're asking, then answer is probably yes. Also if you're worried about Trump's speech this afternoon, bounce.  Do what's best for you, and don't worry about me, or anyone else on here.  I've delivered you SIGNIFICANT returns within an hour of trading... where you go from here is up to you.
