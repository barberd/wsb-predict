So it says that everyone holding the shares by close on May 14th will receive the dividend, so assuming the stocks gonna dump on the 15th, I have 100 shares currently and 5/15 25p that i purchased for 2.50. Since I bought the shares for 23 doesn\u2019t that mean I\u2019m locked in at $500 profit or am I missing something.", "created_utc": 1588727652.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/geafxy/lorl_dividend/", "is_self": true}
