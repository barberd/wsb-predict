{"id": "eksjeh", "title": "Monday (NIO, oil, gold movement)", "selftext": "NIO jumped 2 hrs ago on delivery news: may be able to do something with that. it usually falls down to a lower price just before open,  then surges upwards for 5-10 mins, then peaks and corrects to a lower price within the 1st 30 mins. Usually think kind of pattern, don't quote me on that but might be a quick day trade opportunity.\n\nOil and gold also up. May be good to buy calls in etfs like $UWT in these uncertain times?\n\nMarket should be down so maybe look for some good entry points early this week.\n\nGood luck &amp; May the odds be ever in your flavor.", "created_utc": 1578307779, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eksjeh/monday_nio_oil_gold_movement/", "is_self": true}
