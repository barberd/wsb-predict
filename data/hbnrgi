{"id": "hbnrgi", "title": "AMD and Nvidia Price Targets", "selftext": "Would like to have a reasonable discussion about AMD and Nvidia price targets given the upcoming gaming cycle. Here\u2019s the information I have right now:\n\n1) 8% of gaming computers can play the new PS5 and Xbox Series One titles. This means majority of PC gamers will be incentivized to upgrade\n\n2) While AMD has a growing cloud division, gaming and personal computers is 70-80% of it\u2019s revenue\n\n3) AMD is at a P/E of 128 and Nvidia is at 68\n\n4) Chips for PS5 for AMD not likely to have a huge impact on profit as my understanding is these do not generate great margins so most of AMD\u2019s gains will be in personal computing\n\n5) Both AMD and Nvidia are growing their cloud business and the growth has been surprising to investors\n\n6) Both companies expected to launch new high end graphics cards by the end of the year\n\n7) Nvidia is still the clear leader in the high end GPU space\n\n8) Nvidia was downgraded by Morgan Stanley this week and AMD doesn\u2019t have a lot of high price targets for 2021 on Wall Street (but fuck those guys, what do they know anyways?)\n\nAMD has been bouncing around the $50-58 range for the last month and Nvidia is up around $368.\n\nTaking a stab in the dark, I think AMD will hit $62-67 by the end of the year and could jump 50% in 2021 to $100. I think Nvidia will finish out 2021 around $500 per share.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on these and end of 2021 price targets?\n\nAMD 52.5c 1/22/2022", "created_utc": 1592516822.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbnrgi/amd_and_nvidia_price_targets/", "is_self": true}
