{"id": "g4g8v4", "title": "I just bought some GME (Gamestop), and it just might be autistic enough to work", "selftext": "After about 4 days of research, I am officially bullish on GME. I have built a position of 470 shares and will buy more Monday. I am feeling confident about this, but I am also an autist and a retard so I wouldn't be surprised if I somehow lose all of my money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, here is my bullish thesis:\n\n1) The undisclosed record date for the proxy fight (which means more institutional share recalls)\n\n2) New consoles incoming for the holidays (confirmed) - Historically, the stock runs for multiple months before the new console cycle begins. This time is going to be extremely explosive due to the extremely negative sentiment and short interest. Not to mention about 50% of consoles are bought physically in stores)\n\n3) Gamer activity globally at unprecedented levels\n\n4) Debt payoff/refinancing news and possibly more share buybacks, mixed in with a clean balance sheet\n\n5) Former Nintendo $NTDOY executive Reggie Fils-Aime joins the board of directors on April 20th. Reggie is known for having saved not only Nintendo, but MTV, and Pizza Hut as well. He is a master of building brands.\n\n6) Hestia Capital and Permit Capital (who collectively own 7.6% of Gamestop) have nominated two candidates with turnaround experience and shareholder perspectives to the board for election to GameStop's Board of Directors.\n\n7) Activist investors have been gobbling up shares recently (Michael Burry, Hestia, Donald Foss, Must Asset Management)\n\n8) The extremely bearish sentiment and short interest due to silly arguments (ex: who buys physical? Isn't Gamestop the new Blockbuster? etc.) has artificially moved the stock down to unprecedented levels.\n\n9) 57 million short positions, more than actual shares outstanding meaning potential for a short squeeze.\n\n10) Gamestop has already begun its brand-rebuilding. They have been remodeling stores into gaming cafes and partnered with nearly every major esports organization in Texas. They announced a multi-year sponsorship deal with Dallas-based Envy Gaming, acquired the naming rights to Complexity gaming's 11,000 square-foot \"Gamestop Performance Center,\" and a partnership with Infinite Esports which will include its OpTic Gaming franchise as well as its Overwatch Team.\n\n\\*Note\\* Many people believe Michael Burry to be a one-hit-wonder and an autist. However, when he predicted the financial crisis everyone thought he was wrong, and an autist as well. But he turned out to be right. Maybe its a stretch, but just maybe the same situation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, check out [https://www.restoregamestop.com/home](https://www.restoregamestop.com/home) for more information on the proxy vote, and the two elected candidates: Kurt Wolf and Paul Evans. \n\nPicture of Gaming Cafes:\n\n [https://imgur.com/Fp0R20n](https://imgur.com/Fp0R20n) \n\n [https://imgur.com/smdYomu](https://imgur.com/smdYomu) \n\n [https://imgur.com/WSprZc4](https://imgur.com/WSprZc4) \n\nMy position so far: \n\n [https://imgur.com/m1nxdpo](https://imgur.com/m1nxdpo) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCredit to Reddit user: The\\_Bossss for some of the points I used.", "created_utc": 1587333213.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4g8v4/i_just_bought_some_gme_gamestop_and_it_just_might/", "is_self": true}
