AIMT's new peanut allergy drug just got approved and its got a lot of good news in the future. There is a possible meeting happening with Piper Sandler who specializes in mergers and acquisitions near Nestle's headquarters on Tuesday. They are also estimating the price of the drug to be $10,000 (a lot of people thought closer to $5,000), and this opens a pipeline to other similar food allergies of which eggs and tree nuts are already in the works. If that's not enough, this is going to be a big deal in the media. There are a lot of patients lined up to prevent anaphylactic shock when fat fuck Joey mouth breaths Snickers on all the other kids at the playground. But get this, it gets even better, there are 11.5 million shares short as of earlier this month, possibly more now, and with 13 days to cover. These GREASY MUD DRAGGING BUTT FUCK BEARS have been beating this great stock to the ground for awhile now. But their reign has ended now. They are gonna try one last push on Monday if it doesn't moon first thing in the morning, but this shit is Helms Deep and Gandalf has arrived MOTHERFUCKERS! They lost a lot of money today, but didn't get margin called yet. If we buy enough shares we can rain the Rohirrim on these gays. But don't just buy shares, this babies gonna moon if we feed her enough, so get some of those tasty $50, way out of the money, calls for your first Yacht payment.
