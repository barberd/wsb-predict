This virus is not under control. Stop holding out and get on the winning side. Convert your positions to short.\n\nThe Hang Seng market in Hong Kong and TWSE in Taiwan are continuing to tank. It is just a whiff of what is going to happen in Shanghai come Monday. \n\nMarket volatility is brewing and bubbling. 10 days of closed markets in Shanghai have backed up market volatility so high that it is going to come spewing out and spill over to all the other asiatic markets.\n\nIt will be equivalent of that scene in Stand By Me when everyone is throwing up on each other except coming out of Chinese companies assholes.\n\nPeople saying it's already priced in because things are already trading down on other markets are going to be sorely disappointed and left putting vaseline on their anal fissures from getting fucking so hard.\n\nMarkets are going to bleed red on Monday.
