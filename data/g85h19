{"id": "g85h19", "title": "HEP short DD follow up on unusual options activity", "selftext": "So I saw a post about HEP and it\u2019s unusual options activity(5/15 $2.5 puts) Holly Energy Partners, L.P., headquartered in Dallas, Texas, provides petroleum product and crude oil transportation, terminalling, storage and throughput services to the petroleum industry. I went and did a little DD, thought I\u2019m not super familiar with refinery companies. HEP also provide transportation of petroleum products for their customers. Its subsidiaries and joint ventures, own/or operates petroleum product and crude gathering pipelines, tankage and terminals. I also read that 87% of their 2019 annual revenue was generated from investment grade refining customers. My initial guess is that their overall revenue has dropped immensely, with the oil market crashing and with the demand of oil currently being nonexistent. \n\nThere\u2019s something called the crack spread, this is an oil industry term that refers to the difference in price between where a refinery buys raw crude oil and sells the petroleum products it makes from this oil. The spread is the profit margin made from \"cracking\" unrefined oil into higher-valued refined products, aka gasoline. The current pandemic and demand and price of oil hugely dropping, it\u2019s causing a disruption of epic proportions. Right now there is a negative crack spread, essentially means that companies like HEP are operating at a huge loss. They\u2019re paying more to purchase raw crude oil then they are profiting from selling gasoline to their customers. \n\nSupposedly refining companies benefit from lower crude oil prices IF demand still remains relatively high which that obviously isn\u2019t the case. I\u2019m short on this company at least for their upcoming earnings report on(5/6). I bought 200 $2.5p for 5/15 on Friday. This is my research coupled with the fact that of the unusual options activity on that contract, could also be a hedge so it\u2019s risky play.", "created_utc": 1587864193.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g85h19/hep_short_dd_follow_up_on_unusual_options_activity/", "is_self": true}
