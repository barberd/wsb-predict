{"id": "fnrt2k", "title": "Aggressive Options, PTON-AMZN-WDC-FEYE", "selftext": "Today  I included the aggressive orders, PTON seems really aggressive, but the IV is so high now I think it may be too late to jump into it.\n\nThese  options orders are on or above the ask. Many have the same expiry and   strike. Also lots  of the orders were sweeps so these ppl were breaking down their order to get filled faster.\n\nHere - [https://imgur.com/a/diURZDG](https://imgur.com/a/diURZDG)\n\nAlso   all these orders volume of the contracts exceeded the open  interest  in  multiple trades so it's most likely not closing positions. Either  buy  to open orders or sell to open orders and based on the     aggressiveness  of the orders one can infer its buy to  open.  Some of  these may be  hedges and some most likely not.\n\nAMZN put orders seem very short term and possible hedges since the movement in the stock would have to be huge for a return on those weeklies. FEYE and GLD orders have more time and are closer to ATM so those are decent. For the longer term their was orders for WDC for strikes almost double the current price.\n\nDon't   just enter YOLO's in positions based on this data alone in most cases.   Use  technicals/fundamentals/options data/market feelings all combined   instead of just 1 of these.   Use protection like spreads if you worry   about losing what u put in and be  smart,  understand the  risks of   putting $ into weekly expiry's, consider a longer expiry. Learn IV AND  IV CRUSH!!\n\nAlso  with the market going lower use technicals/fundamentals/options  data-flow all combined.\n\nEDIT   - Wanted to add, I make these posts a lot with different tickers, when  I  am most confident I make a whole thread for one ticker. Like I did  in  the past with MSFT/AAPL/TSLA/DIS, I am saying this because I have   different levels of confidence the orders will work out. These orders   today are aggressive but not super super aggressive. So the confidence   level is lower than something extremely aggressive and unusual like SBUX   order flow.\n\nEDIT  - We are in uncertain times so these orders have less of an impact.  Technicals say there is more room to fall in the indexes so most  companies should follow.", "created_utc": 1584997078.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnrt2k/aggressive_options_ptonamznwdcfeye/", "is_self": true}
