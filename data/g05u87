{"id": "g05u87", "title": "USO and negative roll yields", "selftext": "Each month, USO has to rollover their futures contracts (because as an ETF they don't want to take physical possession of barrels of oil). They do this over a 4 day period and this simply consists of selling their near month contracts (MAY20) and buying the next month (JUN20) contracts. When the near month contracts are lower in value than the next month \u2013 that's when you end up in \u201ccontango.\"  \n\nAs we are in the midst of the April rollover (7-Apr-2020 to 13-Apr-2020) the current USO holdings look like this: \n\n67,844 NYMEX WTI Crude Oil CL MAY20   @ $22.76 \n\n56,420  NYMEX WTI Crude Oil CL JUN20   @ $28.82 \n\nDuring the current rollover USO has been selling their May contracts @ 22.76 and purchasing June contracts for $28.82. This results in negative roll yields \u2013 meaning they end up with fewer contracts in the new month.  \n\nFor example \u2013 when you sell 100 May contracts at $22.76 you can only purchase 78 June contracts at $28.82. And as time goes on and the \u201cnext\u201d month contracts are consistently higher than the \u201cnear\u201d month contracts \u2013 USO falls further behind oil price increases.  \n\nSuch as if oil goes to $40 prior to the rollover \u2013 the 100 contracts would be worth $4000. If oil goes to $40 after the rollover \u2013 78 contracts would only be worth $3,120. And over months this can add up quickly. \n\nOnce Tuesday arrives \u2013 USO will be completely tracking the JUN20 oil prices \u2013 which currently sit at $28.82.  \n\nWhile a rise in oil prices from $22.76 to $28.82 (26% increase) on Monday would be nice \u2013 a little over half of USO\u2019s holdings are already oil contracts priced at $28.82.  \n\nThe difference tomorrow between MAY20 & JUN20 prices will be important to pay attention to for those interested in holding USO longer.  \n\nJust keep all this in mind as you are determining how to play USO. The next roll over dates are not until 5-May-2020 to 8-May-2020.  \nhttp://www.uscfinvestments.com/uso \n \nFurther reading:  \nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-30/oil-etf-seen-as-tourist-trap-with-crude-trading-in-the-20s?srnd=etfs\n\nEDIT: Here's an example of prices that give you an idea of the long term value decay with USO. \n\nOIL\n\n5/23/2016 - $48.08\n\n12/31/2019 - $61.06\n\nUSO\n\n5/23/16 - $11.68\n\n12/31/19 - $12.81\n\nAnd during this time frame the highest point oil reached was $74.34 while the peak of USO was $15.69.", "created_utc": 1586729075.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g05u87/uso_and_negative_roll_yields/", "is_self": true}
