All the autists that didn't buy in on MSFT at 180 bought at 190 and are now stuck backholding telling you to \"buy the dip\" while they furiously masturbate to calm their anxiety and stupidity.\n\nGranted their contracts probably expire in less than two weeks they will most likely capitulate today or tomorrow because Friday is always a sell off.\n\nTHAT BEING SAID\n\nI declare **AMD** as the next meme. Being that robinhood has a total iq of 17, we can get in and pump this bitch to $100 by march. Collect our tendies and maybe Papa Musk is ready for 1200 . Get in while you can because if they announce that Apple is using their chips my boner is going to be rock hard.", "created_utc": 1581521474, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f2svvw/msft_is_shit_buy_amd_calls/", "is_self": true}
