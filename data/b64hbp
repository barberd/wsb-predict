{"id": "b64hbp", "title": "$REV - Insider buying patterns, etc.", "selftext": "$REV is following a very familiar pattern at this point. The company sandbags their quarterly earnings, and then Perelman proceeds to purchase massive amounts of stock every day until the end of the quarter (i.e. at other times he is restricted from buying stock). This is the fourth quarter of this pattern occurring, and he seems to step up is buying at each round. This is a somewhat predictable pattern to folks who have been following this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince earnings came out, he as make purchases every day. For a total of 505,000. Another 35,000 stocks were purchased yesterday. He can continue to purchase today, tomorrow, and Friday. Odds are very high this buying will continue. Pull the Form 4s in Dec 2018 and Jun 2018 to observe these patterns yourself.\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?company=REVLON+INC&amp;match=&amp;filenum=&amp;State=&amp;Country=&amp;SIC=&amp;myowner=include&amp;action=getcompany](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?company=REVLON+INC&amp;match=&amp;filenum=&amp;State=&amp;Country=&amp;SIC=&amp;myowner=include&amp;action=getcompany) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith typical volume of 75K a day, these purchases of 35K - 70K a day matter, especially given the low float, high short interest, and depressed prices from sandbagged earnings call.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n$REV has an ugly history and it is easy to get burned given the way earnings have been sandbagged, the unexpected extension of a standstill agreement back in the fall, and simply high volatility day to day on little or no news.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn March 6th through earnings, I closed out my positions in $REV given how they have handled earnings reports in the past, I was wary of them reporting a hue miss: [https://twitter.com/guanshotshots/status/1103363870545137666](https://twitter.com/guanshotshots/status/1103363870545137666)\n\nThat period saw the price decline from 25.5 to 17.3 on the earnings announcement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI waited for the first Form 4 to be issued last week (at that point it was back to \\~20 / share) - confirming that Perelman was back to buying and to gauge how aggressively - before piling in. He has been consistently buying, and even more aggressively than in the past.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b5qri7/significant\\_insider\\_trading\\_activity\\_last\\_7\\_days/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b5qri7/significant_insider_trading_activity_last_7_days/) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the remainder of this week - continued purchases of Perelman can be reasonably expected every day. There is a lot of upside to this, as it is the largest insider buying of any company. And the company has one of the smallest floats. I intend to hold my position through this week, and see how things develop into next week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is a standstill agreement. I think there is a misconception that this prevents an offer for a buy-out. All it does is require advanced notice and changes the process for a buy-out to make it more favorable to shareholders. I am not so arrogant as to predict the timing of the buy-out,  but he is up to 86.8% of shares at this point. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI posted on $REV previously. That post covers Perelman's buying pattern - owning about 87% of all shares - and a clear intent to make a buy-out offer, but with bad timing. And the post covers other issues around $REV. The timing was poor. And at this point, I have learned not to buy prior to earnings given that are consistently sandbagged, and also outside of buying periods (i.e. between earnings call and the end of the next quarter) price movement is often a total crap shoot.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9p9k31/rev\\_short\\_squeeze\\_in\\_the\\_making/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9p9k31/rev_short_squeeze_in_the_making/) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "created_utc": 1553693242, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b64hbp/rev_insider_buying_patterns_etc/", "is_self": true}
