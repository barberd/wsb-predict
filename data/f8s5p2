Well thanks to corona virus this will all change, their guidance is set low and most likely going to be raised due to their huge influx of sales world wide. I have never seen their masks sold out, not even during the swine flu era. It\u2019s looking like q1 2020 will be amazing, and trading below the s&amp;p as it is I don\u2019t see this following it and sipping much further, it seems like it just broke its resistance and is ready for a bounce back, their are one of the company\u2019s on China\u2019s list for automatic approval of loans, which means their q1 cash on hand will fly if they borrow from the Chinese government, they also recently announced that their factories have been working 24/7 to produce the masks that are still out of stock across the board. \nTheir at their 3 year low, all you autistic traders who are scared to buy puts because you\u2019re so used to buying calls and making money and are looking for stocks that will profit from corona virus, I just found your golden goose. Long MMM earnings are in April but I\u2019m sure we see a price target raise by then... I\u2019m hoping in June 200 calls very cheap and low IV", "created_utc": 1582555306, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8s5p2/mmm/", "is_self": true}
