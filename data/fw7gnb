Thousands of dead, rampant infection rates across the U.S, semi trucks full of bodies. Check in on futures and just as I expected Limit up! Thank god I got jacked to the tits with calls on Friday when I heard more people were dying. \n\n\n8:45 AM :Get a call from the doctor taking care of my mom in the ICU. God this fucking guy! just cause my mom has covid 19 or whatever the fuck and is on a ventilator doesnt mean shit when the tendies are cooking.\n\n\"Hello sir, I'm so sorry to inform you of this but...\"\n\n\"PRICED IN!\" I reply as I hang up the phone. Stupid fucking doctors always trying to get in the way of my profits. \n\n9:00 A.M: Check the fed schedule for the day. \nBRRRR\nBRRRRRRRRRRR\nBRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR\n\nFuck yes. Like me jpow really admires the fantastic economic policies of Zimbabwe. I rub the picture I have of him next to my bed. His bushy arching eyebrows and constant constipated look really get me going.\n\n9:30 A.M to 1 P.M\n\nWatch as the tendies roll in.

Please bby help me....\nBRRRRRRRRRR. A massive green dildo on the chart!!!!! And just like that jpow has saved me with his printer once again! Stupid fucking bears the cure for the virus is of course printing more money!\n\nAs the day draws to a close I begin to spike a fever. By the night I'm coughing and having some trouble breathing. I lay down in bed without worry as I whisper to my picture of jpow...\n\n\"Priced in...\"", "created_utc": 1586208615.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fw7gnb/a_day_in_the_life_of_the_modern_autist/", "is_self": true}
