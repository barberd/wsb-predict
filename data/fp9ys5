{"id": "fp9ys5", "title": "$CACC and Auto Loan Industry DD", "selftext": "So I was about all the way finished with this DD that I spent a while on until safari closed on my Mac for absolutely no fucking reason (fuck you Apple). So now I'm gonna take some more adderall and rewrite it because that's how sure I am this stock will make you guys tendies (not really, I'm retarded). There's a couple recent DD's on this but they're all trash and leave out some pretty big things.\n\nCACC, or Credit Acceptance Corporation, is absolutely fucked and let me tell you why-\n\nSome background: CACC provides dealer financing programs that enable automobile dealers to sell vehicles to consumers, regardless of their credit history or even a lack of one. Basically, they partner with dealers by paying some upfront cash, then split those future cash flows with the company as the company recovers the advance plus some profit.\u00a0\n\nCACC's business model relies bigly and pretty much entirely on debt collection tactics. Because of this, this company thrives almost entirely upon where we're at in a credit cycle and in the economy. And where we're at in a credit cycle is directly linked to employment as shown in this graph: \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1gn76hmf50p41.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f62e6b9b212461254f249e4eeb010014e5ab689b\n\nWhen unemployment numbers come out tomorrow, this *should* go down... a lot. I don't think investors are accurately or are even remotely close in pricing in just how bad unemployment will be and/or get because of this virus in the short term and future.\n\nNow even pre-beer flu this company has been a risky investment. Besides making loans to borrowers with bad to even no credit, which despite what you're probably thinking, is actually very profitable under the right circumstances (which they soon won't be) and legit, they've had and still do have a crazy high valuation and its accounting is also pretty sketch and opaque as they make it difficult/near impossible to see how their loans are really doing. Credit Acceptance uses a form of \u201clevel yield accounting\u201d that is normally applied to purchases of already impaired loans. This means Credit Acceptance doesn\u2019t disclose what portion of loans are delinquent or have defaulted.\n\nInstead, CACC publishes the percentage of loans they believe they'll be able to collect for each period. This has also been one of the biggest drivers of this stock's performance and it will definitely take a hit as they surely have a fuck ton of shitty-credit delinquents who are most likely laid off and unable to afford their car payments. Even the ones with good credit scores will have the same problems.\n\nAnother major driver of this stock's performance is car loan volume. Who the fuck is going to be buying a car anytime soon?\u00a0Absolutely no one. Easily 30 to even 50% of their dealerships can't/won't be able to survive this downturn.\n\nHistorically, cars represent economic success and if the government doesn't address this soon, they'll have even more problems on their plate. Considering democrats have had hawk-eyes on this industries' practices for a while, something will definitely happen soon and it won't be good for CACC. \n\nThey'll definitely be placing a lower cap on auto-loan rates soon to incentive people to buy cars and might even temporarily \"forgive\" people's inability to pay their car payments like they did for renters in order to prevent them from defaulting on their loans and damaging their credit score and/or having their cars repossessed. If they were fine with fucking over landlords like that, they'll definitely be okay fucking over greedy auto-loan companies. Especially since if people don't have cars, they don't have jobs.\n\nAnother signal this company is going downhill is that insiders are selling shares. A week ago, one sold 11,000 and just 2 days ago another sold 10,000.\n\n*Another* thing that's worrisome about this company (yes, *there's more)*, or it's industry in general, is that if you take a look at history, you'll see a lot of parallels between the subprime auto market right now and the subprime housing market in 2008 right before it got absolutely fucked in the butt. \n\nCurrently, the default rate on subprime auto loan securities is among the highest levels ever. Just like subprime autos, the market got bigger and bigger and bigger for subprime housing and then once demand started falling short (again, who the fuck is buying cars?), it fell. And it fell hard... [https://2o9ub0417chl2lg6m43em6psi2i-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/graph-1-1024x768.png](https://2o9ub0417chl2lg6m43em6psi2i-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/graph-1-1024x768.png)\n\nThat was the biggest factor contributing to the mortgage crisis and if the government doesn't do anything about this relatively soon for the auto-loan industry, it could surely reoccur. Either way, it's a win-win for short sellers.\n\nThe technicals on this stock are also pretty bearish. From the start of the coronavirus fear (late Feb.) until now, CACC has only dropped 30%, 400 to 280 (was down 50% on Monday). It's biggest competitor, Santander Consumer Holding (SC), has dropped 40% (60%). Compared to SC, and basically every other stock in the market, this stock still has a lot of room to fall. This might not indicate that much however. The 2-week RSI is currently at 39.31, signaling decently stable price movements. On the other hand, CACC's stochastic reading of 24.98% signals it was way overbought yesterday. \n\nTechnical charts indicate CACC would settle between $276.02 to $291.8. However, if it trades below $237.34, then the market for CACC becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $214.44.\n\nThe bull argument for CACC however is that Credit Acceptance could possibly benefit from a downturn in the economy by weeding out competitors that have consistently underpriced loans and hurt industry per-unit profitability. Also Gen Xers are the most likely to have a car loan and carry the highest balances. Gen Xers are also very likely to die from beer flu and their assets will probably cover the rest of their loans.\n\nTL;DR If you're confident that the economy and/or the credit cycle is fucked buy 4/17 250 puts or 5/15 240 puts if you aren't concerned about volume or OI.\n\nP.S. Take this DD as you will, but I wouldn't just read the TL;DR and impulsively listen to me as I'm retarded and my portfolio can back that. Before tonight I didn't even know this company existed so I'm probably missing some important factors. I'll post my positions later today since I'm a cheap fuck and looking for the best possible entry", "created_utc": 1585222299.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fp9ys5/cacc_and_auto_loan_industry_dd/", "is_self": true}
