{"id": "bigrh8", "title": "Long $AMC (DD inside)", "selftext": "All I've heard about this weekend is Avengers: Endgame. I don't watch myself because I'm not a nerd, but I'm aware the film blew high expectations out of the water and has already set records for highest grossing box office of all time, best in the 108 year history of cinema. Expecting AMC to go on a tear and now is a ripe time to get in. DD below (mostly just free flowing thoughts, sorry):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAMC has the most theaters in the US and in the world; they adjusted hours to 24/7 this weekend and set aside 10M seats this weekend alone, with 58,000 screenings. The film just set records in all 15 countries where AMC has theaters.  Everyone has been so hard far Disney lately, and I am not disputing Avengers to be a huge success for Disney. But Disney has SO many companies and revenue streams: FOX and other TV networks, property/parks, music studio, Hulu, etc etc, but take a look at AMC's income statement....revenue is just 1) admissions and 2) concessions, the latter of which is obviously dependent on the former. AMC will directly benefit its top line from every single ticket sale, period. (Link to all of Disney companies:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/9149yi/companies\\_disney\\_owns/](https://www.reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/9149yi/companies_disney_owns/)  )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAMC's CEO said last week this is just the start of what he thinks will be \"the biggest 9-month span in the history of cinema\". And he would not be surprised if Lion King beat out Avengers later this year. I could not agree more that the movie slate is impessive. Here are some upcoming films with confirmed 2019 release dates: Detective Pikachu, Lion King,  Joker, Frozen 2, Toy Story 4, Secret Life of Pets 2, Hobbs and Shaw, Jumanji 2, MIB, another Star Wars, Aladdin, Shaft, IT, Rambo, Terminator, Zombieland 2, the Tarantino film with Leo/Brad (i forget name), John Wick, and I am probably missing some other decent films. And that is just by end of 2019!

Movie theater attendance in 2018 was a record year despite underwhelming film releases, and annual attendance sets a record every year or two (this was a big surprise to me). I know that I will be seeing Lion King, Toy Story, Detective Pikachu, the Tarantino film myself, and I haven't been to the movies since Blade Runner 2049 came out a couple years ago, and another 2 year gap before that. You can be certain that when people see films like Avengers (3 hours 2 mins long), they will be spending a lot at concessions as well, which is &gt;30% of their revenue and the biggest margin contributor.

Those numbers obviously don't mean anything without context, but it was far greater than they expected since it was launched about 18 months ago. And I'm guessing as people are going into the theater to view Avengers and other big hits this summer, they're going to increase their A-List members just by finding out it exists. It's also a matter of time before MoviePass collapses, similar to \"Sinema\" did last week (basically a MoviePass ripoff). I just checked the Apple app store....AMC A-List is now the #5 free app in entertainment (Fandango is #4, likely because so many people downloading it lately), and #33 overall for free apps in the store. I can't remember where it was at when I checked last month but it was definitely lower.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe financials need improvement, and the balance sheet is ugly at 3.72 Long Term Dt/Eq. PE is below industry but overall fundamentals are not great. But that is why there is 17.15% short interest on AMC, and it should not be underestimated how powerful the squeeze impact could be once it becomes clear that 2019 could very well be a record year for theaters. There's also not a ton of analyst coverage or institutional ownership, which is good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hold shares long and am not interested in options on AMC. I know that's blasphemy around here but I do believe r/investing is full of morons. While I do think Q1'19 earnings (announcing 5/9) might underwhelm due to disappointing movies in theaters right now (what's been the best film of year...Dumbo??? ffs), I'm expecting huge guidance revision/upgrade soon, and expect this to rise above $20/share in 2019, very likely sooner rather than later. The company is lagging the market since the December turnaround; with all the buzz around Avengers, I think it will open quite a bit higher on Monday and then continue to run up to earnings. I think even a 1-week play to earnings could be a very nice yield thanks to the Avengers buzz and strong earnings season thus far (that will likely continue this week with Google and Apple), and I think that medium term play is a very, very good one. This thing will get squeezed up eventually.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: people still go to the movies (2018 was somehow a record year despite weak films), and a whopping 2019 movie slate is about to follow the record setting Avengers film. AMC has the most theaters in the US and across the globe compared to any other company. There's 17% short float on this pig, and it's going to get squeezed up above $20/share at some point this year.
