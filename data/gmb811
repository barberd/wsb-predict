I havent seen anybody talking about this, nor have I seen any articles.  I'm plenty retarded,  but I figured this was a good chance to buy a couple of calls.  Facebook marketplace overhaul?  Acquiring another online retailer?  Who the fuck knows, but I know if the announcement is something that nobody gives a fuck about, I can still get out with little cash lost.  Thoughts?\n\nFB $217.50 05/22C x5 for 1.25 each", "created_utc": 1589839039.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gmb811/mark_zuckerberg_says_big_news_coming_tomorrow/", "is_self": true}
