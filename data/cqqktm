They go live in their mom's basement and binge on mountain dew and cheetos while playing video games. With WoW Classic releasing in a few weeks this economic collapse could not have come at a better time for Blizzard. Plus, the target demographic for WoW Classic are 20 -35 year old males that no longer need to ask mommy and daddy for the credit card number to subscribe. \n\nAfter the recession is over they will completely forgot to unsubscribe and won't even notice the $15 bucks a month going to a completely unused account - much like the 2.1 Million people still paying for AOL dial up. Literally no analysts are talking about it and will be an easy earnings beat for ATVI. Easy money.
