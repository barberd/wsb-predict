I also took out $600 to buy a little something for myself. \ud83d\ude0f\n\nSummary:\nI started at the beginning of February and played Msft and Spce calls to get me to around 1.5k but didn't time the market reversal and went down to around $500. Was about to call it quits so I pretty much went Yolo on what I had left on Spy puts. Sold those for some nice gains and expanded to airlines, cruises and dis.\n\nCurrent positions: I've been riding the spy 250p for awhile now. Little concerned about market closures today but they're itm and I should be able to sell them before anyways. The single DIS put is one I bought last week with leftover buying power for like, $65. I literally have no explanation for the spy calls, other than I had them originally for hedging and just think that they're good luck at this point.\n\nStill have some cash because I couldn't make a split second decision EOD today on whether I thought it was bounce or continue the tank tomorrow.\n\nFuture positions:\nStill anticipating spy to tank more. We obviously have not hit rock bottom yet. I think that's around $200. Not gonna hold DIS until expiration, I think theta is gonna eat away at that.\n\nStay gay, bears. Bulls if you're still alive, good luck.\n\nTldr; SPY 200p 4/20.", "created_utc": 1584398756.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fju2wg/i_joined_the_5_digits_club_today_150_10000/", "is_self": true}
