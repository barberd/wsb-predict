{"id": "g4yr9s", "title": "Big position on crude oil futures CL", "selftext": "Hey everyone, as we all know oil plunged insanely today. Though we should never call the bottom I feel like you can\u2019t go wrong with this play. I have $10k I wanted to throw into options but since that hasn\u2019t been going so hit for me and oil just plunged I feel like I should just throw it into CL. The problem is I\u2019m not as experienced with oil futures as I am with options. If there any recommendations? Am I over my head? Will I just lose the $10k and should just stay on options?  If I should do the oil futures play any recommendation I would really appreciate.
