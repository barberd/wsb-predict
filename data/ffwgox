{"id": "ffwgox", "title": "Time in the market, my story", "selftext": "Long time lurker, first time posting. \n\nWife and I had a baby last week. Well, she had a baby with her lover while I pretend it's mine so I can take advantage of my company's paternity policy. Thank wsbgod they don't require pictures or DNA testing as proof. Can't trade stocks right now because of the outtage, so figured I'd tell a story. \n\nI dabbled a bit up to the point of her baby arriving, all long term investments over in Scwabb and e-trade, boring r/investing boomer stuff. Work is hectic, but opened an RH account to prep for my time off work: had some short term Target calls expiring 2 weeks early, played with a credit spread and got assigned, started to stroke while sucking daddy, all kinds of kinesthetic learning for the moment I take on the early morning baby watch shift and join in on the fun (west coast trader). Call it a soft launch before lubing up for some big plays. \n\nThat day finally came. Wife is sleeping next to lover on the hospital bed. Baby shit his pants, but is sleeping so I fire up a set of plays to trigger at market open. My dick is hard for the first time since daddy stuck 2 fingers up me. It's go time, but it isn't. Robinhood is down. Open up reddit to see all my new friends panic. Huge gains gone. Here, there, everywhere. I punish myself to keep the boner alive, but decide its best to take a week off so you all can take home tendies and not me. \n\nLast night I'm ready to come back. My punishment is over, trades are lined up. Penny stocks and meme paid because DD is for grinders. Morning is here. Baby is sitting in the swing in his shit again, this time crying, but I have my headphones in so fuck him, the cats can have him. Everything is ready to go, monitors are up, trump Twitter on auto refresh and gay porn shuffle mostly, but it's time to finally see my trades go through. \n\nTrades suspended, RH down. \n\nTime in the market can't beat timing the market when I'm highly correlated to app failures.
