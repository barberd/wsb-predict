I have grown my Robinhood account from $50 to $5,000,000 using this two simple strategies. \n\nStrategy 1 - I come onto r/wallstreetbets the day before I trade. I look at what people are saying will go up. I then short. Profit.\n\nStrategy 2 - I do my own research on a stock. I have a really strong belief that it\u2019ll go up. I use this information to make a decision. I critical think. Then I short. Profit.\n\nThis can be done the other way, if they say it\u2019s gonna go down, you go long. Boom. Profit. \n\nPM me to buy my other trading strategies, class as cheap as $5,000 and Personal tutoring for $500 an hour.", "created_utc": 1564269469, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ciofzp/for_everyone_losing_money_i_have_a_solution/", "is_self": true}
