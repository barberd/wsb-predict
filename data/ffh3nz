The numbers of infections and deaths being published daily are indicative of the size of the outbreak two weeks ago. It takes &gt;3 days for symptoms to appear, and most deaths occurred greater than two weeks after infection. \n\nSo let\u2019s look at Italy. 366 deaths already. Those deaths are attributable to cases from &gt;2 weeks ago. If we assume a 2% mortality rate, we would estimate 366/.02=18,300 cases in Italy two weeks ago. The number of infections seems to have been doubling every 3-4 days in the west, so Italy could have had as many as 300,000 mostly asymptomatic cases by now. \n\nI know it sounds ridiculous that actual numbers could be this high. Look at the case of the River Anuket. A passenger on this cruise ship in Egypt tested positive. All crew members and passengers were subsequently tested. 45 people tested positive. All cases were asymptomatic. \n\nThe official figures being reported are only capturing a small percentage of cases, and they\u2019re only doing so days to weeks after the virus was contracted. The number of new infections will probably peak with college spring break travel in the coming two weeks. The market will probably continue to be on edge, but the end of this sell off is in sight. Emerging markets could also benefit from the complete collapse in energy prices, as their GDP growth is more capital intensive rn.", "created_utc": 1583693804, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffh3nz/you_have_less_than_two_weeks_to_get_extremely_long/", "is_self": true}
