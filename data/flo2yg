California just shut down it\u2019s state! \u201cOh, you work for Blue Apron.. that\u2019s essential to life saving. Get out there son!\u201d\n\nAnyway. Buddy of mine at a hedge fund gets assigned to do DD on this ass hat company and texts me screenshots of their current twitter replies which is drowning in unsatisfied customers...\n\n[You can check out the Twitter replies here ](https://twitter.com/blueapron/with_replies)\n\nGrocery stores are already almost empty and limited on food essentials. These grocery stores are numero uno when It comes to priority delivery in the supply chain. Blue Apron is not going to be able to get food when competing against large grocery chains trying to stock the same food. As this virus spreads and these businesses start to become affected from sick personnel or limited resources, the strain on those supply chains is going to increase and when they do the grocery stores will be the main priority. I consider this $APRN\u2019s last breath. Goodnight sweet chef.\n\nEdit 1: Sorry forgot to provide positions. 250p @ $.43 4/17 - $2 strike. \n\nThe other reason I am pretty bullish on this position is because I was discussing with a family member who works for a larger butcher distribution in the tri-state area who services massive grocery stores and he said they were having trouble keeping up with supply and that if a smaller number of employees get sick at their butcher houses, they have to completely close and be disinfected and then inspected. They are also under pressure from government officials who want them to prioritize grocery supply. \n\nCrazy times. Be well!
