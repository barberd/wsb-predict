YETI got destroyed by supply / demand issues \u2013 they have a one trick pony business (design here, make in China).**\n\n**07/17/2020 20 P, sell one month out**\n\nI have been trading / following YETI since late Feb \u2013 it was the primary target of my \u2018we\u2019re going to get wrecked by China getting closed down,\u2019 but it has, of course moved to \u2018we\u2019re going to be in lockdown for a while.\u2019\n\nEvery day before lockdown, I walked past a stand of YETI cups at my local Wholefoods to get my Powershot. Towards the end of Feb, I noticed that the number of things on the rack was dwindling. You couldn\u2019t get tumblers in the colors you wanted, and you couldn\u2019t get some of the random accessories they sell.\n\n**Supply Problems**\n\nThe bet I had was that since China was in lockdown, Yeti would not be able to meet their customer\u2019s demand due to supply issues \u2013 as an aside, in their 10-K, you can see that \u2018for our hard coolers, soft coolers, Drinkware, and bags, our two largest manufacturers comprised approximately 90%, 48%, 81%, and 79%, respectively.\u2019 They also go on to say that \u2018For our cargo, outdoor living, and pets products, two manufacturers accounted for all of the production of each product in 2019.\u2019 We\u2019re not idiots, it\u2019s the same two companies that make the stuff above. Also, I remember reading somewhere that they want to diversify their manufacturing out of China (bad shape - making masks, and ventilators), and to Italy (bad shape), and Mexico (bad shape). Safe assumption they are manufacturing almost everything in China.\n\n**Demand Problems**\n\nBut now that we\u2019re in lockdown, YETI\u2019s troubles are double. They now have issues on the supply side, and the demand side. If you read further down their 10-K you\u2019ll see that in \u2018In 2019 and 2018, our wholesale channel accounted for 58% and 63% of our net sales\u2019 The 10-K goes on to say that the duration terms of the contracts \u2018is typically less than one year\u2019 with payment terms of Net 30. My hunch is that these contract terms are month-to-month, and get adjusted on what the buyers at, say Dick\u2019s, decide what they want to do. This means they have lost a significant portion of these Wholesale Sales already.\n\nNext is the big one \u2013 \u2018For 2019, our DTC \\[Direct to Consumer\\] channel accounted for 42% of our net sales.\u2019\n\nThey aren\u2019t selling anything direct to consumer now. Who of us is going to be buying an overpriced \u2018luxury\u2019 cooler / tumbler / whatever else while we\u2019re all stuck in our houses?\n\n**Debt**\n\nYETI has a \u2018growth model\u2019 - aka a lot of debt.\n\nI just got off the phone with my accountant, and he said to me that YETI would not be eligible for an SBA loan.\n\nI\u2019m not a corporate bond guy, but YETI has a lot of debt obligations. I have a good friend who knows a lot about bonds, and I\u2019m going to run through their debt situation tomorrow, and I\u2019ll update this post.\n\nAlso, let me make this clear, I don\u2019t think YETI is going out of business, they have cash, a lot of debt, and supply and demand issues. I think they\u2019ll make it out, they\u2019re jus wrecked in the meantime.\n\nEssentially, though, money going out the door, no money coming in the door.\n\n**Furlough / Firing**\n\nI haven\u2019t seen any information about Yeti\u2019s furloughing / firing people \u2013 search strings on Twitter / LinkedIn / Reddit turned up negative for \u2018Laid Off\u2019 \u2018Furlough\u2019 for \u2018YETI.\u2019 One of their warehouses is owned by the owners of the company \u2013 hey Adam Neuman \u2013 and they did do a post on Twitter saying that while their stores are closed, they will still be paying their store employees \u2013 doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t be firing their own staff, though. More money out the door, no money coming in the door.\n\n**Forecast Sales**\n\nI took the 2019 net sales of $913 M, and made a seasonal looking chart \u2013 it doesn\u2019t really matter since YETI is wrecked on the supply, and the demand. I forecast the numbers out for 2020, and included reasoning for the monthly proportion in the below table \u2013 either demand problems, or supply problems. My guess for when YETI is \u2018back to business as usual\u2019 is October 2020.\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yhdvjdrgiwr41.png?width=794&format=png&auto=webp&s=68bfbafeb02a596d587c27327a64c46721695844\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vk24nklkiwr41.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7e22a520562912d7a345da487014535f1b2d564\n\n**Preliminary analysis 1 - Sales as an indicator for stock price**\n\nThis is a safe bet. YETI doesn\u2019t do any manufacturing. Even if we get mega stimulus round two and workers can go back to the factories, they can\u2019t in YETI\u2019s case since all the factories are in China. They can just drink from a rambler in the distribution center.\n\nIn early Feb YETI\u2019s market cap was just over $3B which considered Yeti\u2019s huge growth potential / pumps from buyout rumors. I think if you remove the growth / buyout hype (I\u2019d say around 20 - 30% premium to \u2018Fair value\u2019) and switch that with a 2020 drop in sales of 38%, a reasonable market cap for YETI is at most $1.3B.\n\n**Target for YETI - will refine over the weekend**\n\nGiven my prediction of a MC of $1.3 B, I think a fair (hah fair, Powell BRRRRRRRRRRRRR) price for YETI stock is $15. It will take time for it to really hit YETI hard, but it\u2019s in the sales numbers.", "created_utc": 1586485770.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fy6c8y/the_case_against_yeti_wrecked_by_supply_and/", "is_self": true}
