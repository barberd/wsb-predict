How can I get intentionally assigned stock, I need the low-risk leverage.", "selftext": " **I want to get assigned on my very deep ITM (.7delta 2DTE) SPY, QQQ, or WFC puts spreads (those are the positions I have right now lol).**\n\nI have been assigned rarely (less than 6 or 7 times), despite making hundreds of ITM spread trades each month, the last time I got assigned using RH I was on GME 3.5 CALLS in a debit spread a day after ERs. The problem is that RH won't let you buy back stock with the buying power you get from being assigned since they restrict accounts even if you have enough BP to cover it yourself, so I had to tell (email) them to do it for me manually which really sucked since the stock went back up at open before dropping back down to lows of yesterday and I missed out on some small gains. During the aftermath of the whole beyond meat stock craze, I got assigned on a deep ITM call calendar spread and the stock shot up 25$ bucks on 06/10/2019. if RH would have let me sell I would be up 9K that day and made back all my losses overnight. it seems call get assigned more often than puts for me, idk why but stats say that early exercise of calls doesn't make sense to do unlike for puts but it happens more often tho anyways. I want to know how to get assigned on puts tho since RH at least lets you sell back the shares you get assigned since they only allow for you to close positions in your account when you get assigned even if you have the BP to cover the assignment.\n\nTLDR: Which stock options have you guys gotten assigned on, what was the strategy behind them, and when/how long did you hold the position until the assignment occurred?", "created_utc": 1592377309.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ham83z/help_how_can_i_get_intentionally_assigned_stock_i/", "is_self": true}
