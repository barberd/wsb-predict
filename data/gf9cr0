{"id": "gf9cr0", "title": "Your next earning play for big gains, $SDC (tldr included)", "selftext": "**Why read this and *not* skip to the tldr?**\n\nEarning plays can *feel* random most of the time, but they're not. If you do your research, they can be predicted fairly consistently. I've done the research for you here, and all these words are just to help you understand why this is a good buy. You can skip to the tldr but it's not recommended. [My last DD was MTCH](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9na5t/why_mtch_will_be_your_next_1000_play/) calls before earnings. MTCH is down today (I sold yesterday), but had a run up of 7% in the days before earnings and another 10% boost after earnings. Just look at the [5-day](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/mtch) chart. I was also the guy who called for SNAP calls and TWTR puts right before their respective earning reports. All these decisions are not made at random and are done with a little research. Sometimes when I think I've found a golden egg, I share it with you guys. [Yesterday I combed through all the earnings of next week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gemdsx/all_earning_releases_for_next_week_week_of_may/) and found my next earning play. SmileDirectClub has [it's earnings](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/sdc) on May 13th. I'm telling you a week early so you guys can profit off the run up. The stock is currently at 7.48, I expect above 8 the day before earnings and above 9 after.\n\n**What is SDC?**\n\nSmileDirectClub (SDC) is an oral care company and creator of the first direct-to-consumer medtech platform for teeth straightening. They are currently attempting to revolutionizing the oral care industry with cutting-edge teledentistry technology. Their whole platform revolves around convenient, affordable and *remote* orthodontic care. If you really wanna look at what they offer, [this is their website](https://smiledirectclub.ca/en-ca/).\n\n**Why invest?**\n\nSince launching in the U.S. in 2014, SmileDirectClub has become one of the fastest-growing health technology companies, and is right now, serving over one million customers around the world. In January 2020, they expanded its offerings, introducing a complete oral care system, including LED teeth whitening, electric toothbrushes, toothpastes and more. However, due to covid19, they are far from their recent highs. Just three months ago, they were sitting above $15. This stock is currently severely undervalued. It's important to note that their work is mail-based and thus, sales should not be as affected by the lock down compared to dentistry companies. They've expanded due to the quarantine to ship more of their products for at-home use. Their largest competitor (ALGN) has been shut down essentially because they work entirely with dentists. \n\nAlso consider how kids are more vain than ever now and would much rather have clear aligners than braces. What SDC offers is way cheaper than braces too. Hence why insurance companies are picking them up like candy. Cheaper for them and now cheaper for parents, plus covered under insurance to make them even more expendable under FSA and HSA (flexible and health spending account). \n\n**What's new?**\n\nRight now they have partnerships with UnitedHealthCare and Aetna. But beginning in May, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield. These new partnerships with these healthcare insurance companies should lead to increased sales for the direct-to-consumer oral care company over time. [Some reading material](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/06/why-smiledirectclub-stock-is-soaring-today.aspx). \n\nThose major insurers adding access to them with extended coverage will drive huge revenue growth. I expect SDC to beat earnings and raise guidance due to this news. Stock already popped some on the news the other day. Should go further when it\u2019s discussed more in depth during earnings.\n\n**Earnings?**\n\nLike I said, SmileDirectClub has [it's earnings](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/sdc) on May 13th at 4pm. It will increase guidance due to the insurance deal I mentioned earlier. In addition to this, there's [56%](http://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=Sdc&submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2) short interest with about 5 days to cover. With good earnings, it could all be a powder keg to a huge spike in stock price in a very short window. Like, 40%+ if the stars align. \n\n**tl;dr** Remote dentistry company that will kill it in earnings. Just got a new insurance deal that should raise guidance. Company is currently far from pre-covid19 valuation. Easy earnings play for next week. **8.50c 5/15 or 8.50c 5/22** And yes AutoMod, I know this is a breadline.", "created_utc": 1588867566.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gf9cr0/your_next_earning_play_for_big_gains_sdc_tldr/", "is_self": true}
