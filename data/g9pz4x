{"id": "g9pz4x", "title": "IMGN not playing IMGN earnings call", "selftext": "Listen up degenerates. I'll try to make this brief, but probably won't succeed.\n\nIMGN is smaller biopharma company that produces a number of innovative therapies, most of which are used in the treatment of cancer. It's slated to report earnings on the 1st, and from past experiences, this bad boy knows how to move on an earnings call.\n\nNow I'm going to give it you straight, from one autist to the next: the last 1.5 years have definitely been tough for IMGN: it's seen a couple of setbacks in its drug testing and its had to restructure to the tune of laying off 75% of its workforce last June. But it's on the road to recovery. Why do I say that it's recovering?\n\n1. It's consolidated into a leaner, meaner, cancer fighting machine that prints tendies: the layoffs were designed to conserve cash that it put right into funding the longer term future of the business and narrow the focus to its most promising drugs\n2. It's got not 1 but 2 drugs in the coveted Phase 3 of testing: do you know what phase 3 of testing means, degenerates? No, of course you don't. Do I? No, of course I don't. But the market does, and that's what matters.\n3. One of these drugs is in the even more coveted \"pivotal trial\" status: I won't even bore you fucking morons with the details of this, but let's just say this is a big fucking deal, and they've staffed up the trial for it, so hopefully no Covid interference on that\n4. It's got momentum going for it: Q4 earnings (the first since the layoff) had a huge surprise when they clocked in positive and everyone thought they were going to lose a bunch of money. I doubt the ship has been turned around since then, I expect to see of this momentum in Q1\n\nIf on the 1st they either report an earnings beat or they talk about any even nascent success in the pivotal trial, this motherfucker is going to gap up big time. This shit is volatile and loves a good success story, so get on board before the tendie train leaves without you.\n\nThat said, not financial advice, and this is a gamble. Do with that what you will.\n\n**TL;DR**: I got 40 contracts of 5c 5/15 and so should you - IMGN being stupid enough not to buy calls on IMGN\n\nEDIT: Wrong expiration because I'm autistic  \nEDIT 2: Positions because it's what the people want", "created_utc": 1588090011.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9pz4x/imgn_not_playing_imgn_earnings_call/", "is_self": true}
