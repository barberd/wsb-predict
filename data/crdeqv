I bought Grocery Outlet (GO) calls for 9/20 @50$ per share (they were .10 at the time). \n\n I just checked Robinhood this morning for the first time since I bought and the option I bought is selling for around 1.00$ now, but I\u2019m confused.. can I just sell call contract back?  What do I do now?  I read online that you might have to buy the underlying stock if you sell the contract? Somebody enlighten me, I don\u2019t pretend to be a day trader and I don\u2019t really give a shit but RH is saying this went up like a lot of percent, how do I get out?", "created_utc": 1565993870, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/crdeqv/help_me/", "is_self": true}
