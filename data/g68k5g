With non-essential work basically cancelled in all major cities where the majority of their properties are held, the company is STILL responsible for the upkeep of its properties which means a skeleton crew of maintenance and security staff, insurance, utilities, etc.   My bearish thesis is based on the fact that the cities where SLG operates the majority of its properties - eg NYC, Chicago, Boston, etc.  also happen to be the same places where lockdowns will remain in effect LONG after the rest of the country opens up.  (These cities also happen to be areas with very high minimum wages and cost of living which impacts salary bottom lines.  Yes, they will be downsizing many of the staffs but people still need to be on site per local regulations). \n\nWhy? Population density = higher infection vectors.   \n\nNot to mention the cleaning bills which the operators will be liable for in terms of decontaminating office space - I am talking about hiring the men in white biohazard suits to spray down lobbies, elevator banks, and cubicles - I don't know how much those cost but it cannot be cheap.   \n\nI am looking beyond tomorrow's earnings to see the rest of the summer and possibly fall.  Spring is usually when new leases are signed by commercial tenants - SLG and others will have to offer fireside sales to get people inside.  Work from home is going to revolutionize the industry and hurt their margins.  \n\nTLDR: SLG May 40p\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x0k2fw9gffu41.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=a82031eb083f1e857679d94d55e9bb622f7c4cac\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cfofl17kffu41.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c1f7bd90f34680455e8810678746320ee99161d", "created_utc": 1587586751.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g68k5g/sl_green_commercial_real_estate_reit_reports_42320/", "is_self": true}
