Risking being cynical, **it is not about the deaths**, indeed they are tragic but the real issue lies in the % of people that need to be hospitalized because of the disease. Having no healthcare capacity is whats gonna cause chaos not the fact that old people are dying.\n\nApparently if we believe the reports, China fend it off. How? \n\nThey shut down 50% of their countries economic activity for a period a month and implemented some of the strictest quarantine measures we have seen in history. China's greatest threat will come from outside, because of no demand. and infections coming from the outside.\n\nWhen the virus starts spreading locally worldwide, healthcare systems will collapse right and left. At that point panic takes over and the real challenge for Democracies begins, they either impose the same measures as China or risk being held in a position that just hopes for it to go a way without any real actions take. \n\nAs for the stock markets, rates will have to be brought to 0, from what we have just witnessed with the 50 point cut in rates leaving us with rates of 0.5%, if the same effect is expected then we are in real trouble if panic selling begins due to the situation. \n\nBut Stonks only go up right?\n\nCan the market shrug off having 50% of the countries workforce in idle mode for a month? \n\nTLDR: Dont expect to go ATH in the near future, and if they get there literally pull out with all your force before the thing swallows you up.\n\nYes i'm all in, deep, in puts.", "created_utc": 1583250663, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcwihd/rate_cuts_the_end_of_the_beginning/", "is_self": true}
