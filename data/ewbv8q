All you need is a 25k starting and some good ol max leverage from rh and TD and youre good.\n\nI started with 25k, and through going all in on swings on leverage, was able to get it to 60k in about 3/4 of a year. Then I realized rh is shit for trading and switched to td, where you get 4x leverage. Thats right. 4x. Now I could buy up to 240k of shares. And 1% of 240k is 2400, its like trading options except you actually have a good chance of making money.\n\nTldr, buy shares on max leverage for tendies", "created_utc": 1580416776, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ewbv8q/i_quadrupled_my_account_in_1_year_only_using/", "is_self": true}
