This is a huge win for BYND. \n\nFrom CNBC: \n\n[Dunkin\u2019](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=DNKN) is adding [Beyond Meat](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=BYND) to its menu, as the plant-based meat trend continues to gather steam.\n\nThe coffee chain is offering a breakfast sandwich made with Beyond Sausage, starting with locations in Manhattan. The company plans to roll out the menu option nationwide in the future.\n\nShares of Beyond jumped 3% in premarket trading Wednesday, while Dunkin\u2019s stock rose 2%.\n\nDunkin\u2019 is the first U.S. restaurant chain to add Beyond Sausage to its menu. Canadian coffee chain Tim Hortons, which is owned by [Restaurant Brands International](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=QSR-CA), recently rolled out breakfast sandwiches made with the plant-based meat substitute. It also added its first ever burger \u2014 the Beyond Burger \u2014 to its menu.\n\nConsumer demand for more vegan and vegetarian options has been driving restaurants to add products from Beyond and its competitor Impossible Foods, although some like [McDonald\u2019s](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=MCD) and Chick-fil-A are sitting out for now.\n\nThe NPD Group found that 18% of Americans are trying to reduce their meat intake. The U.S. market for meat substitutes reached $1.44 billion in 2018, according to Euromonitor data. Beyond\u2019s market share is only about 2%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's see if we get past $200 today... that has been a big technical point of resistance.", "created_utc": 1563967680, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ch6ybg/dunkin_adding_bynd_sausage_to_their_menu_starting/", "is_self": true}
