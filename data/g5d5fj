{"id": "g5d5fj", "title": "Time to go short?? Technicals are starting to say YES! SPX500 Technical Analysis | Bearish breakout of ascending channel & support with RSI divergence.", "selftext": "sup dudes.\n\nYesterday I posted technical analysis and suggested a bearish move was likely coming. Check it out here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4ss93/spx500\\_technical\\_analysis\\_key\\_levels\\_for\\_the\\_week/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4ss93/spx500_technical_analysis_key_levels_for_the_week/)\n\nToday that move began and SPX500 is finally presenting a very nice opportunity to enter short. Following strong RSI divergence and a rejection at three distinct Fibonacci extension levels, price broke down multiple levels of structure and is beginning a reversal to the downside. \n\nLink to original idea: [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/SPX500USD/vxbkCEQT-SPX500-Bearish-Breakout-of-Channel-Structure-RSI-Divergence/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/SPX500USD/vxbkCEQT-SPX500-Bearish-Breakout-of-Channel-Structure-RSI-Divergence/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a112ce3rf5u41.png?width=2732&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff9f5ae27bf7b59ea117d161a866c7699f02244d\n\nPrice reaction to fibs is super interesting. Multiple bounces from fib retracement levels & multiple rejections at fib extensions.\n\nAlthough this price action is incredibly bearish, I would still like to see price break down the next 2750 support level to invalidate the bullish trend and provide bearish confirmation\n\nI saw this setup forming earlier today when I was analyzing S&P E-Mini Futures, but I decided to copy all the analysis over to SPX500 just for you guys. Here\u2019s how it looked before:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b0pesrxog5u41.png?width=2732&format=png&auto=webp&s=23b58fe2bf54e4dc332a4a7255a7cae0277cdccb\n\nI just realized that I forgot to point out the completion of two harmonic AB=CD patterns on my SPX500 idea, but you can just look at it above. (The big red curved arrows and the straight pink arrows illustrated on ES1!) The completion of these two harmonic moves also point towards a potential reversal.\n\nThose of you who are risk averse and not completely autistic can wait for price to break further down before entering short.\n\nIf you are a true WSB retard and you just want to gamble, fuck it buy some SPY 280P 4/24\n\nIf you like my TA and want to stay updated when I post, then shoot me a follow on tradingview.
