{"id": "ewwbya", "title": "$TONKS and $BECKY: 1+ Month Update (Spoiler: $TONKS is outperforming everything)", "selftext": "It's been about a bit over a month since I've started tracking $TONKS and $BECKY. Since their conception on 12/19/2019, $TONKS is up 7.11%, $BECKY is up 1.45%, and the S&amp;P is up 0.63%. $TONKS is outperforming white girls and the rest of the American economy and it's not even close. \n\nToday I added $SPCE to the index. I also decreased the weight of $AAPL, $MSFT, and $AMZN. In order for $TONKS to reach its true potential and hit the moon, we need to decrease our dependencies on the big boys and let TSLA, SPCE, and AMD carry us.  \n\nLemme know what else I should do. \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZgG5JNffElQK_UICs9V4xwd1L4N7Yumfb_Pzj-GaVF0/edit#gid=0", "created_utc": 1580510409, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ewwbya/tonks_and_becky_1_month_update_spoiler_tonks_is/", "is_self": true}
