This is my analysis of the situation and I'd love to start a conversation to see just how far up the spectrum I am.\n\nThe current environment is that the fed can print to buy assets which delays inflation and the stim checks/bailouts float the economy above a crash and current deflation works in favour. However if confidence in the dollar/fed printing is lost due to cases/deaths/job loss then maaaaaaybe the fed loses grip on confidence and their printer becomes obsolete. This is difficult to gauge as it is up to investor sentiment and it seems the fed is working hard to decouple the market from the economy with printing. Oil and world flocking to USD as reserve currency due to fear of their own doesn't help the put game either.\n\nWhat factors am I missing? I know we're globally tied and my analysis is only using USA factors. What about shadowbanking, loan defaults, foreign bond purchasing, etc. What else can save my puts? Boris Johnson dying of beer flu?\n\nI know China is opening back up just to have factories mass lay people off, also as they're opening up the rest of the world is drying up in demand due to quarantines. Their manufacturing economy is fucked. 40% of their small businesses are supposed to default by May. \n\n&#x200B;\n\ntldr: Brrrrrrrr vs infected/job loss/deaths. When the latter gets high enough the brrrrrrr stops mattering. spy 150, 196p 5/15", "created_utc": 1585334523.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fq2t7k/controversy_of_direction/", "is_self": true}
