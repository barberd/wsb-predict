We know Wall Street and Investor aren\u2019t all autists, so why did earnings just defy everything we ever knew about stocks. \n\nCompanies are barely meeting or slightly exceeding their Q1 expectations which were all lowered to reflect the impact of Covid-19. But the shelter-in-place didn\u2019t even start until late March, so essentially, these expectations should have never even been lowered in the first place. In the middle of March, people were out shopping, dining, doing whatever, spending money. Yeah China was down, but manufacturing only stopped for a few weeks, and all other economies were still going strong. \n\nStocks like FB, Google, Tesla, all up 10% on earnings that came in line with lowered expectations for a quarter that was mainly no different than any other quarter. Then, they all speak to the unprecedented impact that Covid is having on their business (starting probably in April) and the stock just rallies more. \n\nFacebook says they saw a \u201csteep\u201d decline in ad revenue at the end of March, but it stabilized in April. So what does that mean, it stabilized as-in stopped declining, or stabilized as in came back to normal. I would go with it stopped declining, but they still could be sitting on 20-30% declines.\n\nTesla sold a shit load of vehicles in Q1, we knew that. In Q2, they aren\u2019t going to sell shit, and their factory could be shut down until June 1st, 2/3rds of the quarter. China won\u2019t make up for that. Stock flies up. \n\nAnd despite all this, what the market hates most is uncertainty. So now we know that Q2 earnings will be very bad and uncertainty about the economy and virus are anyone\u2019s call, yet earnings are flying off the rails like companies defied all odds in Q1 and the economy is back to normal. \n\nSeems like market doesn\u2019t care about uncertainty anymore or future earnings, just cares about right now. WTF...\n\nTLDR\n\nLet\u2019s hear the gay broski comments.", "created_utc": 1588195794.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gai6uj/market_makes_perfect_senseyeah_effin_right/", "is_self": true}
