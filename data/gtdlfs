{"id": "gtdlfs", "title": "Short CHGG", "selftext": "Ever since almost every college has switched to online learning chegg\u2019s number of subscriptions has skyrocketed with students wanting to gain access to homework, quizzes, and test answers. \n\nMy experience with chegg as a college student has been that about 70% of the people that use it for these online classes are using it to cheat on their exams by posting the questions on chegg to be answered.  \n\nOf course this sort of cheating can be eliminated by the teacher using something like ProctorU or any other screen sharing service. However, most of my professors in my last semester and as well as most of my friends\u2019 professors did not elect to use these programs instead trying to make the test uncheggable if you will. \n\nHere\u2019s were the trouble happened. A fake answer was posted online by a professor on chegg which led to a large scale investigation into my class from the deans office.\n\nWe were notified of the investigation and within three days people started receiving emails that they had been accused of cheating on the final exam. Talking to some of the people that I know cheated, they had no information on their account that linked back to their name besides a credit card or paypal on the account AND they only viewed the questions on chegg meaning they did not post the questions themselves. \n\nStudents see this as a betrayal of privacy from chegg as once a investigation from the deans office is launched Chegg will not hesitate to cough up your information to the school to protect themselves from copyright issues. This combined with the professors catching up and planting \u201cboobytrap\u201d questions will lead to a large number of cancellations of subscriptions along with the summer arriving in a company that was already overvalued in my opinion.\n\nThen again don\u2019t listen to me I\u2019m just a college student who hates both chegg and the people that use it on my exams.
