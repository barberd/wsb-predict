Changing my game up-", "selftext": "Yeah I know-who gives a shit right?\n\nThat last dump got me. \n\nSo I\u2019ve been trading ever since someone sent me a RH invite-\nThat would be 2 months.\n\nOf course it\u2019s a mad rush, better than the shitty sex-with the ex (tho honestly even a Big Mac topped that).\nI\u2019m stuck home like everyone else cuz CoRoNa-why not try to make some money?\nAnd I did-made it, lost it, made some more, lost it. \nSpend most of my days cramming in knowledge and being a true autist convinced that it will be different for me-cuz you know-special. (Maybe I should have tried cramming in the knowledge differently, idk)\n\nPulled out my tiny 401-k cuz, autist.\nOpened a think or swim account, and was ready.\nFirst choice? Tesla-good quality stock. Right? Lmao now. \nAnd of course, bought the day before Elon\u2019s tweet-literally. $855 the almost all time high at the time. FOMO. \n\nThe rest of my illustrious stock trading has pretty much been the same. \n \nSo now I have a bunch of recovery stocks.\nI was up almost $40k. \nI\u2019m back to what I started with....and have a shit ton of overpriced recovery stocks. \nI hate that damn red-May just switch the colors just to give myself a mind fuck. \n\nBut! On to my stupid point-\nI keep reading about puts calls etc.\nMy inner autist is convinced this will be different-cuz, special. \nSo now I\u2019m throwing the full brain power of my autist mind at learning how to play some options and lose money that way. \n\nI\u2019ll update in a week when I\u2019ve gone full pro.\n\n/s", "created_utc": 1593023586.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hf6isl/that_last_dump_changing_my_game_up/", "is_self": true}
