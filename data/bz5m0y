Because I'm an idiot and didn't notice the earnings report coming out Friday.\n\nWhat of, could of, should of, ass though.\n\nMy point: What are your opinions on the days to come for BYND? \n\nAre we expecting a TLRY situation or is this company going to fucking Mars next (down - short-term)? Honestly it already hit Neptune (way too fucking high?).\n\nThe question is, will it hit Pluto or drop back down to Mars (short term) then rise up and hit Jupiter (not as far as Neptune)?\n\nMods are gay.
