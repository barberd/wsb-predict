I'm here with something a little different from what I normally do. I\u2019m gonna learn ya how to play earnings like the big shots down in NYC. Okay not really like them but I am going to teach you how to do it like you aren't the stupidest crayon in the pencil box.\n\nSo let me lay out a little table of contents for you first. I am going to;\n\n* Explain what goes into picking a play\n* Go through how to know when to sell and when to have diamond hands\n* Show some examples of earnings plays I have advocated for in the past\n* Give general pointers/ a wrap up\n* Be incredibly crude and border on stage 4 autism\n\nSo let's get right into it shall we?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How do I pick an earnings play?**\n\nFirst things first, what is an earnings play? An earnings play is when you bet, either using options or buying shares, that a company is going to either do good or bad when they report their earnings. Earnings are reported quarterly which, for most companies, means they are reported April/May for Quarter 1, July/August for Quarter 2, October/November for Quarter 3, and January/February for Quarter 4. These months are called \u201cEarnings Season\u201d. We can use earnings to decide if a company is doing good or bad and if they will do good or bad in the future. Good quarter (increased revenue, profit, etc.) stock price usually goes up. Bad quarter (net loss, supply problems, scandels, etc.) stock price usually goes down.\n\nSo how do I pick one? Well my little shit-stain, you pick a company or industry that you feel you can anticipate easily. It sounds easier than it is, I know. So let's run through a little example. You start hearing about this Covid thing in March. You think, \u201cHey, if medical PPE (personal protective equipment) is hard to come by right now, then a lot of people must be buying it!\u201d That's the first step, put two and two together and realize that world events do, in fact, influence the economy. So now that we know PPE must have a high demand, we can look to the next step which is research companies that will benefit (or do bad) if the situation in question happens. \n\nThis research is a BIG part of an earnings play. I know that here on WSB we like to jump headfirst into plays without doing any research whatsoever, but if you want to make money then I would do at least a little bit. Research;\n\n* What a company does\n* What their main sources of revenue are\n* HOW MUCH DEBT THEY HAVE\n* How much cash they have\n* And what influences their sources of revenue\n\nThe debt part is very important along with the sources of revenue and their influences. With debt you want to look for if it is manageable or not. I wont get into that here but my boy u/fuzzyblankeet writes many a great post about how to read a corporate debt sheet. Try [this post about PLAY](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fx6b0t/playtimes_over_fuzzy_does_db/) and you should have a good bit of information for that smooth brain to digest. The key takeaway is that debt and when it expires drives how a company spends their money and if they can profit in the long run. Of course, know where the company's revenue comes from. Does it come from what they produce? Does it come from advertising? Where do they attract the most customers from? What geographical area does the majority of their sales come from? Blah, blah, blah, you guys get the gist. You don't need to understand every aspect of the company, not even the CEO\u2019s know everything about their companies. You just need to know enough to comprehend where a company can go if they have a good or bad quarter. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**When do I sell and when do I hold?**\n\nNow that we have a company we want to play, we buy in and wait until we get close to earnings. Unless I am getting ridiculous returns way before earnings, like 200%, I hold until I get within a few days of earnings. Now here is the tricky part. The obvious thing to do is that if you think a company is going to have a good quarter, you hold through earnings and ride that price sky high. Well, that can be true but a lot goes into it. Let's go through a few scenarios.\n\nA company is trading pretty sideways for days and days. It gets to the day before earnings and is still trading sideways, doesn\u2019t have a lot of volatility. This is a prime example of investors not really being worried about earnings at all. Earnings will still influence the price but major swings aren\u2019t likely. Earnings being good will lead to new investors buying in and bad earnings will mean investors will sell but for the most part the market doesn\u2019t anticipate anything big happening. It's best just to hold these through earnings and hope it goes the way you anticipate.\n\nThis next scenario deals with you thinking a stock is going to go up because of earnings but it will also work in reverse when dealing with put options. So earnings come out tomorrow. The price was trading steadily around $69 for the past few days. All of the sudden, the day before earnings, the price begins to shoot up to $71, then $73, then by 3 o\u2019clock it's at $75 a share. This is evidence of the market ANTICIPATING good earnings. Earnings haven't come out yet but, as we say all too often, they are already \u201cpriced in\u201d. Now when earnings come out things can pretty much go two ways. The price can continue to go up because earnings were somehow BETTER than anticipated. Or, (and this is the more likely scenario) the price will drop after earnings because they weren't quite as good as the market anticipated. This is what happens when your calls rocket in value before earnings then bottom out after, and you sit there sobbing with your tendies out the window saying, \u201cbUT EarNInGs wERe gOOD!\u201d It sucks, but I\u2019ve seen this exact scenario happen many times and it has happened to me too. So the best thing to do here is if there is a large run-up the day BEFORE earnings, take your gains before they release and don't be greedy (we will get more into that later).\n\nThe last scenario deals with more volatile stocks. Let's say you bought calls on a stock that you think is going to go up after earnings. The week of earnings it is jumping around like a nutsack on a jog. It started at $20, then dropped to $17, then up to $24, back down to $19, all the way to $27, then back down to $16 before earnings are reported. We can gather from these crazy fluctuations that there are conflicting ideas on what the results of earnings will be. From here, the best thing to do is to just stick with your DD and hold through earnings, because clearly nobody fucking knows whats gonna happen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Some real world examples**\n\nI'll break down some lingo here real quick. If you already know just skip to the next header where it says LAKE. When I say I bought calls for a certain date (4/17), I mean they expire that day and I can no longer trade them. Strike, is the number I think the share price can rise to or be on the way to when I sell. The decimal numbers (.70, 1.10) are the premium you pay per share to buy an option contract. So a .70 premium will cost $70 to buy, 1.10 will cost $110. That should let you understand a little more.\n\n**LAKE;** First, let's look at the Lakeland Industries play I advocated for a while ago. We go through the research process and decide that a medical PPE company will make money because of the coronavirus. I'll go ahead and use my own plays so I don't have to make a bunch of shit up. \n\nEarnings for LAKE came out on 4/15 after hours. On 4/8 they were trading at a low around $14.95. I bought calls for 4/17 (after earnings) at $17.5 strike for .70. Then on 4/14 I doubled down and bought calls for 4/17 at $20 strike for .30 and at that point they were trading around $16.50. Then comes 4/15, they have a run-up all day and at one point hit $18. THIS IS THE POINT I SOLD. I sold BEFORE earnings and took my profits. The $17.5 strike had jumped to 1.45 and the $20 had jumped to .65. These are both over a 100% gain. \n\nAfter close earnings were released. They were great. It showed an increase in revenue, less debt, and a bunch of other good shit. The only problem was it wasn't as high as people anticipated. On 4/16 LAKE hit lows of $15. This is just how it happens sometimes. \n\n**JNJ;** We also have the Johnson and Johnson play from the 4/9-4/13 post. They make medical stuff, home staples, you know what JNJ is. \n\nEarnings came out 4/14 before open. On 4/13 they were trading around $139.77 and this is when I bought in. I got calls for 4/17 at $147 strike for .60. That day it stayed pretty low because no one expected earnings to be fantastic. They were fantastic and the price soared to $146 on 4/14. I sold that day to lock in gains and protect myself from a sudden drop of other people cashing out their gains. The value went from .60 to 1.10 for an 83% gain. \n\nNow the price kept going up in the following days and honestly I should have held for longer. I would have if I would have bought longer dated calls. Overall, what I did here was a good choice but I could have squeezed more money out of it if I was more reckless. That is the key word, reckless. Not taking such a large gain and hoping that it will go up just a little more is reckless in the long run even if it would have worked out this time.\n\n**HAS;** Last we will look at Hasbro which a few of us got burned on last week. I bought some HAS calls for 5/8 at $85 strike for 1.10. Earnings were set to come out 4/29. \n\nThe day before earnings the price went way up for my options. I was looking at over 100% profits. This should have been the perfect sign for me to sell because earnings can't be good enough to rationalize such a run-up. I didn't sell. Earnings came out and they reported barely breaking even. Investors thought it would be a good quarter, it wasn't. Now I\u2019m stuck bagholding these options waiting for them to expire at the end of the week so they can get the fuck out of my portfolio. DON'T BE GREEDY.\n\n \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**General pointers/ Wrap up**\n\nTruly, the best thing you can take away from this is to not be greedy. Take the profits you get. The difference between a 100% gain and a 100% loss can be holding just one day too long. Take in the signs and learn how to read the market trends. Price goes up before earnings? Sell and lock in gains. Price goes stagnant? Hold. Price goes opposite where you thought it would? You are either very wrong or know something that no one else does and you might as well hold. \n\nHere on WSB, the consensus is usually to make as much as possible for the meme. Well, do you want to be a meme or do you want to consistently make money. I know your answer is you want to be a meme but you know what the smart answer is. If you have over 50% gains (which is more than most professional investors make) take it. Protect yourself.\n\nAlso, if you can't afford to lose your entire account then you shouldn't be doing this. If your Robinhood balance hits $0 you should not be worrying about how you are going to pay bills it should just be an \u201coh well\u201d moment. And remember for the few and far in between moments that you do make money, put some back for capital gains taxes so you don't get fucking audited. This post explains a lot that you need to know in regards to taxes. \n\nThat's all I really have for you. I hope this makes earnings plays a little easier to understand. It takes practice and practice leads to losses, just don't get too butt hurt. We all lose at some point and the only way to consistently win is to not play.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR;** Fuck you, read it.
