LVMH (makers of $1500 handbags we can\u2019t afford to buy our girlfriends) just bought $TIF (same deal here but necklaces) for $135 a share. $TIF is trading right now at just under that and 5/20 calls with a $135 strike are like $0.40 a contract. Here\u2019s the trade:\n\n1. Buy as many calls as you can afford\n2. TIF continues to climb after being bought by the worlds largest luxury personal goods firm. \n3. ????\n4. Profit\n5. Don\u2019t tell your girlfriend about all the bread you made, lest you get suckered into buying her shit. \n\nSomeone please tell me why this is too good to be true even though it\u2019s too late, I super leveraged myself and bought enough calls to go bankrupt 100x over if I lose it all.
