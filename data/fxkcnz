The market doesn\u2019t even react to any news at this point. It just goes up. Technical Anal is hardly even applicable at this point, SPY goes up on no news, high volume, low volume, doesn\u2019t matter. OPEC deal is priced in both ways, we\u2019re out of the bear market, and analysts left and right keep yelling v shaped recovery. This is uncharted territory, this type of movement in the market has literally never happened, you can\u2019t even look at 2008, 1987, or 1929 anymore. Honestly at this point just hop on the JPow printer express to SPY 300 and then join Drill Team 6 down to 220. \n\nTL:DR Fuck you, news is not applicable to market movements anymore, nothing makes sense, everything is ass backwards\n\nTL:DR TL:DR SPY 300c 4/17 then SPY 220p 5/15", "created_utc": 1586400263.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxkcnz/everything_is_priced_in_and_nothing_is_priced_in/", "is_self": true}
