Target earnings is this week and I've been doing a little research and thought I'd share for anyone looking to make a little extra cash. So I came across this little concept called Targeted advertising.\n\n [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted\\_advertising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_advertising) \n\nDon't even try reading about it, it's almost impossible to wrap your head around, but I have a very high IQ from watching Rick and Morty so allow me to explain. Basically, online advertising and social media companies including heavy hitters like Google, Facebook, etc. are heavily engaged in sending people Target ads. With all the Target ads people are getting, they're bound to keep shopping there. The mere mention of this store sends Beckys running and you know they can't enter the store without spending $150 minimum each run. With a machine like this behind them, I can only see the stock going up from here.", "created_utc": 1573989884, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dxlg3v/target_can_only_go_up_from_here_details_inside/", "is_self": true}
