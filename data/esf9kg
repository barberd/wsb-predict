Let's see how he's performed against the $XBI with two years to look over.\n\nHis most recent post was [I'm a thug ass dude with a bad attitude](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/6y8vx3/im_a_thug_ass_dude_with_a_bad_attitude/) that he posted on September 5, 2017. He lists some longs and shorts. Let's see how he performs against the $XBI.\n\n\n$XBI -- Up 13.21% (83.82 --&gt; 94.87)\n\nLONGS\n--\nGILD -- Down 25.9% (85.10/sh --&gt; 63.10)\n\nAVXS -- Up 153.7% (85.94/sh --&gt; 218) (bought out by $NVS)\n\nREGN -- Down 24.1% (471.49 --&gt; 358.22)\n\nONCE -- Up 83.2% (62.50 --&gt; 114.50) (buyout from RHHBY)\n\nSGMO -- Down 38.7% (13.45 --&gt; 8.45)\n\nSHORTS\n--\n\nACAD -- Up 14.1% (36.93 --&gt; 42.14)\n\nMDCO -- Up 77.4% (47.92 --&gt; 85) (bought out by $NVS)\n\nNBIX -- Up 79.6% (57.74 --&gt; 103.70)\n\nINCY -- Down 38.9% (129.46 --&gt; 79.10)\n\nShkreli was kind of bailed out by Avexis and Incyte here, but if you held an evenly distributed portfolio long all of his 'longs', you'd be up 45%. Of all his shorts, up 33%. Evenly  distributed, short all his shorts and long all his longs?\n\nYou'd be up 10.4%, underperforming the biotech index and pretty much every market index out there.\n\nLet's keep digging though. He also [likes HZNP and ALXN.](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/69zern/hznp_alxn/)\n\nHZNP he called pretty much perfectly -- the stock was trading around 10.50/sh in May 2017 and is now worth $38.25, a 275% increase.\n\nALXN, not so much. ALXN was trading ~$120/sh in May 2017, and now trades at $110.47/sh, down about 8%.\n\n\nOn February 2017, Martin says to [buy GILD](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/5sqwnl/buy_gild_tomorrow_on_weak_q/) reasoning that it's worth about $120/sh. At this point, it's trading around $66.36/sh. It currently trades at $63.07/sh, down ~4%. It hits the 80s a few times, but never hits 90, nonetheless 120. To be fair, I don't think anyone would have expected GILD to be so bad at M&amp;A.\n\n\ntl;dr -- He got Avexis and Spark right, the rest ehhh.", "created_utc": 1579714480, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/esf9kg/boring_post_that_no_one_but_me_wants_to_read/", "is_self": true}
