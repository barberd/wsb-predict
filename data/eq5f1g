Hopefully you guys are swimming in tendies for SBUX!\n\nTo address the concerns: Apple going up 34% on the 3 month chart and 13% on the monthly is not a huge concern for me mainly because of these gains are supported by the integration and expansion of  Apple's service revenue and wearables (airpods/watches) revenue as part of it's core investment strategy. I think it's a healthy move to diversify and branch out from the flagship iPhone revenue which generates some 60% of it's revenue. Apple looks to be staging a great foundation for the development of the service platform which aims to help provide an insurance for customers at a relatively reasonable price ( which I assume will become even more affordable and therefore, profitable as they scale this area). Numbers in last fiscal quarter also suggest a growing revenue share in this area. As per the wearables technology, the watches are becoming increasingly adapted to the active lifestyle market, which is an attractive combination of both technology and sports. I don't see a big competitor in this space as Apple has already established such a strong foundation in this product and the dominance of it's competitors are disproportionately favorable for Apple.\n\nOn second thought, the airpods are also a great technology that they can expand on. Recently there is some buzz on earphones as a health product, by integrating technology that can monitor heart rate and blood pressure through the ear canal via the airpods. This makes a great deal of sense as the skin is much thinner in the ear passageway compared to the wrist that the watch monitors off of. Would be really cool to see if they can work with something like this, and perhaps even integrate a voice recognition system and a translating software (like Google) to make the airpods more than just convenient, but highly accessible. \n\nI'd assume that ER will do commensurately better than the previous year, and we should be seeing some great numbers to support this growth. ALSO! integration of AMD technology into their new macbooks are going to be big for gamers and tech enthusiasts who have largely been accustomed to the Intel processors for ages. AMD is also a grow and developing company and their potential in unison with Apple can be a game changer for the software/high performance gaming market that Apple can also enter into. So, cheers to that my friends! Goodluck!", "created_utc": 1579290670, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eq5f1g/aapl_330_c_320_and_340_c_619_are_good_buys/", "is_self": true}
