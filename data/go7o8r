The \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b who love the Chinese showdown currently would lead us glorious bulls to only expect that stateside companies who love America would be at the greatest benefit of these increased tensions. \n\nSince we are all at home with our hands down our pants and 25%+ unemployment that looks like it will be here for the long term, President Pump will most likely sign a FDR labor force participation bill that will get us back to work and squash the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b from defeating us. \n\nBuy anything to do with hard lumber, heavy equipment, raw earth materials, transportation, 3m, BUD, weed, bcuz construction workers luv em.
