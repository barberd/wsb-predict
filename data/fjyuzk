{"id": "fjyuzk", "title": "You got to call the chicken tendies if you want chicken tendies.", "selftext": "So I was at McDonald getting some chicken tendies since I'm to retarded to make any in the market.\n\nThen I looked down at my phone and saw this headline \"McDonald have the biggest drop since 1987\"\n\nAfter my father handed me my happy meal (with tendies) he told me. \"Son McDonalds is a blue chip company, they pay over 4 dollar in divident. The company is on a fire sale\". I thought to myself Jesus fuck if this is what boomers think, this mother fucker will bounce back hard. I looked at some other pictures like how it was effected by the 2008 crash etc. It actually did relatively good. It make sense since poor depressed people eat cheap junk food. Also people who eat at McDonald don't care about the corona virus. It is like the least horrible disease you can get there. In short maybe the old man was on to something.\n\nI quickly sprang to action and sold my bionicles collections and opened a new account (on a boomer friendly site because fuck Robin Hood). I then put in an order for some 3/20 calls but to my horror I wasn't able to trade options until my transfer cleared. I found something else called \"stocks\" instead (it's like buying a call but you also want to make a strong statement about your homosexuality). So now I'm the proud owner of 4xmcdonald stocks.\n\nBuy Mcdonalds call for boomer bounces!\n\nTLTR: If you going to put calls on anything put it on Mcdonalds. I bought Mcdonalds stock (It's like buying a call but you also want to make a strong statement about your homosexuality) because I didn't deposit my money in to RH but instead to some boomer friendly site that didn't allow me to buy options until my deposit cleared.", "created_utc": 1584418215.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjyuzk/you_got_to_call_the_chicken_tendies_if_you_want/", "is_self": true}
