From the start my goal was to hit 25k so that I could day trade (fuck that stupid rule).  I had the chance to sell all my puts above 25k 4 times.  I even strongly considered putting it all into TSLA and AMT shares and leaps because I am bullish on them long term, but I was convinced it would go lower.  Instead everyday for the past 4 weeks of quanartine I have stared at this sub, futures, weekend dow, trump pressers, and my portfolio hemorrhaging money.  \nI keep telling myself that the rug pull is coming but I have learned that stocks only go up.  My buying power is close to nothing and I missed the mega dip.  With the US on track for economic instability every few years, I\u2019ll get them next time.  \n\n\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b and \ud83c\udf08\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc02 loss porn and stories welcome here\n\nRH screenshot ](https://imgur.com/gallery/8cKjcZE) withdrew 4K of gains and put it into a ROTH IRA and bought shares (some puts too fml ), the only smart move I made in the past 3 weeks.", "created_utc": 1586909592.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1h5uk/grievances_thread/", "is_self": true}
