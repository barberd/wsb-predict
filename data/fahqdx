{"id": "fahqdx", "title": "Formal discussion of where the market is headed.", "selftext": "*Please keep things civil and let's try to assess how this market is moving for the good of all.*\n\nIn the past week, it's fair to say this market has been very bipolar with SPY/Techs adding an average of 3% one day, to losing 3% the next. For a lot of people, I am seeing mixed reactions from a few that profited largely to those that are always on the opposite side of the market.\n\nHere is my assessment of the market and the implication of the coronavirus in the short-medium term:\n\nCOVID-19 from a medical perspective is concerning. It has surpassed the SARS outbreak of 2002 by incidence and mortality rate, and in a shorter amount of time. What is a common misconception and commonly referenced in this sub is comparing the coronavirus to the flu. The two are entirely different for one reason: COVID-19 is an **airborne** transmittable condition, whereas the flu is not. Airborne diseases are particularly concerning from a physicians standpoint (credits to a friend of mine in pediatrics/general care) because they travel significantly faster, have a much larger reach, and can infect masses in a short amount of time. COVID-19, though having significantly less death counts compared to the seasonable flu, poses a greater threat to humans at this point because there are currently no viable drugs for treatment and vaccines for preventative care. Moderna and Gilead at the forefront of this treatment are still far from a vaccine which is the most important thing for the outlook of this disease. Moreover, treatments are currently in late-stage development (albeit probably expedited for approval) and has not been tested on large samples of humans. I anticipate a viable treatment potentially in April and May, and a vaccine 3-4 months further down the line. That is if COVID-19 isn't beginning to mutate.\n\nThe implications of this virus is clear in the tech sector. The argument that I hear is that companies do not lose value simply because of delays in production, and once production is back in full force, these companies will appreciate. The issue with this conjecture is that factory delays do in fact depreciate the valuation of a company because it demonstrates 1) an inability for these companies to mitigate from natural disasters, 2) an over-dependence of out-sourced labor in a country that we are having tariff wars with, and 3) the lack of a diversified geography in overseas production. For tech, delays as such as be worrisome for short term value investors (day/swing traders) and call option traders. Take TSLA for example. The stock sat at around $900 5 trading days prior with no immediate signs of a pull back. In light of the 92% reduction of car sales report in China for Jan vs February, the car industry as a whole took a steep drop. TSLA in particular is already back in production, but they are currently seeing 42% loss in registration from December vs January, and I suspect the numbers are going to recede with February.  I am particularly interested in TSLA as it had such a tremendous last quarter, but the difference between the first/second quarter should help investors better understand the current valuation as being over-extended. I would even imagine $500 puts for April as reasonable. Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Apple are all likely to suffer extended losses with outlook revisions guiding downwards. Both apple and microsoft revising guidance and anticipating misses in revenue is also worthwhile to look into. \n\nMoving into the analysis of the movement. Stocks having daily value ranges that stretch, 8% of it's value. These fluxes can be seen in today's early trading hours when SPY reached $300 and all tickers were deep in red. If you line up 30 of the most popular large/mega cap tickers, you will notice that they are head north at the same time. This is a good indicator of algo trading as opposed to optimism in traders. It would be reasonable to believe that traders are buying the dip if these tickers were driven up in separate pace, but you will find a clear indication that many tickers experienced heavy volumes at the exact same time. I use Starbucks as a good support. For Starbucks, it's very clear where their next earnings are headed with the closing of 90% of their stores in China and this being their second largest market after the U.S. Their reopening of 3000 stores will not likely have a recovering effect with the virus still posing a significant threat all across China. However, this ticker moved from -3.80% lows to nearly positive when everything began to move north simultaneously.\n\nTLDR: Let's talk about your thoughts on the trajectory of the market in the short term. I anticipate further bleed in the weeks to come. SPY will likely visit sub $300 in the coming weeks. Over-extended techs will bleed out. Algo trading rebounded many large/mega caps today, but I suspect a quick selloff  out of the blue.", "created_utc": 1582832982, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fahqdx/formal_discussion_of_where_the_market_is_headed/", "is_self": true}
