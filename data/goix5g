That's what I don't understand.   \n\n\nThe calls on the other side to \"straddle\" it don't make sense because, well . . . they are so far OTM that it is very likely they expire worthless.  \n\n\nJust going through the scenarios here of what could happen by June 12  \n\n\n1) ECO labs goes up A LOT (doesn't seem likely): Calls gain value, puts lose value. This person is HEAVILY weighted on puts. So unless ECO smashes through 290 and hits . . . 370 range, the value of the position goes down. I think it VERY unlikely that this person is betting on ECL going up  \n\n\n2) ECL remains flat: I can see this, but again, why take this position if ECL is just going to remain flat? This is $120M of tied up capital.   \n\n\n3) ECL is going to TANK and when it does, this person (or hedge fund) will be buying up a ton of shares and exercising the contracts. It doesn't make sense to me that they are holding shares of ECL right now because why take a $130 position that only gains value if ECL goes down? If that's the position, why not just sell shares of ECL? Also, the contracts are already so expensive, that whoever purchased them is going to have a hard time finding buyers, which is why I think they plan on exercising the contracts at some point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI couldn't find any news on ECL that makes this play make sense to me. So it feels . . . insider? Or someone went out and did \"The Big Short\" style DD and decided ECL is going to crash.  \n\n\nThoughts?", "created_utc": 1590152447.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/goix5g/looking_for_some_dd_on_ecl_ecolabs_that_would/", "is_self": true}
