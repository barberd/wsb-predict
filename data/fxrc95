I wrote up the following storytime post last week during the dark times and was going to just let it die after getting automod'ed a few times... but a few of you autists seem to want to read it. Markets have flowed differently (#RIP\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b, #RIP\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udd90) since then, but the story is one worth reading none-the-less. Enjoy and good hunting:\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(Originally posted Saturday, April 4th, 2020):* It's been one hell of a week... markets fucked the bears, then the bulls then anyone long gamma. Growth died, value (ex-energy) died and momentum died. If your portfolio's still alive... congrats on your #thetagang tendies & there's still the weekend for Trump to tweet something out to completely screw your \"portfolio\".\n\nWith one little tweet on Thursday, Trump got the markets more excited than a teenager discovering porn for the first time:\n\n[Note the words \\\\\"expect\\\\\" and \\\\\"hope\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/qbmrtlci8sr41.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=64a596113737d17fb0a36ba9bd241d47f3313c7c)\n\nDamn if that didn't go and destroy \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b in a single tweet. Credit spreads led by shitty e&p's tightened, equities ignored the largest initial jobless claims number ever and crude oil had the largest single day return of all time. Straight up boiler room shit. If market-manipulation weren't illegal, he'd be claiming to have engineered the \"greatest pump of all time\"\n\nExcept he'd be wrong. That award goes to a little company called Porsche.\n\n**The Squeeze**\n\nRemember 2008? Bear Stearns was bailed out, Lehman was allowed to fail and shit was hitting the fan. GM, Ford and Chrysler were begging for handouts in the middle of the worst auto market in 25 years.\n\nNow if I were to tell you that for a brief period that year, that Volkswagen became the largest company in the world, would you believe me?\n\n[Now those are some serious gainz](https://preview.redd.it/uvhmiivq8sr41.png?width=1303&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf0c55986d941e8fc0a7bfd7d318dfcbd5056f25)\n\nFor a few brief minutes on October 28th, 2008, the price of Volkswagen stock was up more than 113% in a day, hitting \u20ac1,005/share (for you autists, a \u20ac is like a $, except when you put it in the bank they take some away from you instead of giving you more) and beating out ExxonMobil to be the largest company in the world (for a couple minutes). This was after the stock had already shot up 93% the day before.\n\nSo how did this epic two day squeeze happen? To explain, we have to look back at history, starting with WWII.\n\n**The Part With Hitler**\n\nIt was the mid-1930's and Hitler was chomping at the bit to get a chance at a rematch with the US for the title belt. He was doing what he could to boost up the German economy and wanted a car that could rival Ford's. He commissioned Volkswagen to create low-cost transportation for the German people and an up-and-coming engineer by the name of Ferdinand Porsche designed the iconic Beetle.\n\nHe became famous for his work and left to start making sports cars on his own. Thus Porsche was born.\n\n**The Part With the Cuckoldry**\n\nPorsche had two kids, a son and a daughter, and the daughter married a dude named Pi\u00ebch and so the Porsche and Pi\u00ebch families ended up controlling the Porsche company. Happy ending, right?\n\n*Wrong.*\n\nThe Porsche and Pi\u00ebch families fucking hated each other. The Porsches looked down upon Pi\u00ebchs because they weren't real Porsches. The Pi\u00ebchs looked down upon the Porsches because they were weak and cucks. Literally.\n\n[Porsche family tree. This guy fucks.](https://preview.redd.it/q2sqm1ju8sr41.png?width=1182&format=png&auto=webp&s=e16237f2e8a3916778397264b0de3f2d42e7ad81)\n\nFerdinand Pi\u00ebch (remember the name... he's important later) had a public affair with his cousin's wife for twelve years and even had two children with her. Can see why the two families hated each other, right?\n\nThe families fought about everything and finally, in 1970, decided that no member of the Porsche or Pi\u00ebch family should work at the family company and that outside managers would run the company. Great, right? Well not for Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch.\n\nYou see... our boy Ferdinand was an up and rising star in the automobile world and was the leading contender to take over as CEO of Porsche. But because of this squabble, he was forced out of the company he was a shareholder of and took at job at Audi, a Volkswagen owned brand. He rose up the ranks and became CEO of Audi in 1988 and CEO of Volkswagen in 1993.\n\n**The First One's Free**\n\nPorsche's long relationship with Volkswagen now spanned three generations. Post-WWII, Porsche relied on Volkswagen more and more as a partner, even to the point of many of their cars essentially being Volkswagen chassis with a Porsche engine.\n\nBut there was one issue. Volkswagen was a super low margin company ($125bn in revenue vs $2.2bn net income in 2005) and so as a shitty company, its market cap was only $17bn. Super cheap and open to a hostile takeover (which would've ended this decades old relationship).\n\nThe state of Lower Saxony in Germany had held a 20.2% voting block in Volkswagen ever since it was privatized so to prevent any future hostile takeovers of Volkswagen, Porsche really only had to hold a small position. They announced that they were spending $4.2bn for a 18.5% stake in Volkswagen.\n\n**Porsche Goes Autist**\n\nLike each of you autist knows... there's no feeling like clicking that \"buy\" button for the first time. Porsche effectively positioned itself to block any hostile takeover of Volkswagen, but it had now tasted the sweet sweet taste of trading and now wanted more.\n\nIt started trading Volkswagen. First by buying a few more shares at a time, then by buying calls. Eventually they were doing exotic structured products trades with investment banks with the underlying being... you guessed it, Volkswagen stocks.\n\nBy 2008, Porsche had a 35% equity stake in Volkswagen. It was still selling cars, but like a true autist, it was raking in tendies from trading derivatives on Volkswagen. Of its 2Q profits in 2008, only 20% came from making cars and the rest came from \"hedging transactions\". A true autist and seriously one of us.\n\n**Arbitrage**\n\nListed companies have different ways they can practice shitty corporate governance and screw over their shareholders. One method is to have two different shares of stocks (see $SNAP, $GOOGL) where one class, the ordinary (ords) have voting rights and the preferred (prefs) have a \"guaranteed\" dividend, but no voting rights. Depending on the dividend, important shareholder votes, etc the price action of ords and the prefs may be slightly different day to day, but they're still shares of the same company so they should move in sync over the long run.\n\n[Chart 1 - Candle: Ords, Green: Prefs \\[Normalized to 100\\] \\/\\/ Chart 2 - Red: Spread](https://preview.redd.it/z1b9biny8sr41.png?width=1508&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cbe0b00d5eafd7672bd47042a0457a167a23b27)\n\nIn 2008, the candle (Volkswagen ords) and green (Volkswagen pref) lines started moving apart in March and accelerated throughout the year. This got the attention of the guys on Arbitrage desks at hedgies, prop houses.\n\nWhen you hear \"Arbitrage\" (See also: LTCM), think \"Literally can't go tits up\" desk. They do \"risk free\" trades and this type of trade was perfect.\n\nYou see... having a 35% ownership of Volkswagen, Porsche had also announced that it wasn't buying any more shares. So in theory these two lines should've been moving together and there wasn't any risk of this spread going higher. By buying the prefs (the green line) and shorting the voting right ords (candle), hedgies could eat this spread \"risk-free\". Eventually that spread would come together. By early October 2008, this trade was incredibly popular and short interest on the ords was 12%\n\n**Porsche Goes Full Autist**\n\nOn October 26th, 2008, Porsche, in a [press release](https://www.porsche-se.com/en/news/press-releases/details/news/detail/News/porsche-heads-for-domination-agreement-1), stated that instead of 35%, it now owned 42.6% of Volkswagen ordinary shares. It also announced that it owned call options (in the form of structured products) on an additional 31.5% of the company. It was now officially announcing its intention to take out Volkswagen, after saying for over a year it had no intention to.\n\nFerdinand Pi\u00ebch who was still CEO (and also a 10% owner of Porsche; board member of both companies... great corporate governance, right?) showed that he had engineered a way to not only cement himself permanently as CEO of Volkswagen, but by combining the two companies, become an even bigger presence in the auto world than his grandpappy.\n\nIf you're following along and doing the math.... Porsche with 42.6% of voting equity + 31.5% via calls = 74.1% of the company. Also the state of Lower Saxony owned 20.2% and index funds owned an approx 5%. That's 99% of all the ords. The holders of the 12% short interest were... royally fucked.\n\nSome of the world-famous hedgies that got bent over during those two days include: Steve Cohen, David Einhorn, Paul Singler.\n\n**The Aftermath**\n\nThe funny thing is that Porsche had really, truly gone full autist on the trade. Porsche had borrowed more than \u20ac15bn to finance the stock and derivative purchases over 3 years and \u20ac10bn of that was due soon (in the middle of the financial crisis... guess if they were able to refinance). To make matters worse... in true autist form, they didn't have the money on hand to take delivery of the shares they had the right to buy via their options.\n\nUltimately, in what is a fucked up ending to a fucked up story.... Volkswagen bailed out Porsche by buying Porsche AG (the manufacturing arm) from Porsche SE (the holding company) so that Porsche SE (the holding company) could finish buying Volkswagen. Essentially... Porsche SE now owned Volkswagen who owned Porsche AG. Hmm.\n\nPorsche's CEO gets fired for this royal fuck-up and goes to work as a pizza boy at a pizzeria (really). Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch, as a large stakeholder in Porsche, now controls the company he's the CEO of.\n\nAnd thus ends the story of the greatest short squeeze of all time.\n\n**tl;dr:** Germans went full autist, causing an automaker to become the largest company in the world during the middle of the GFC.\n\nPositions: None", "created_utc": 1586434358.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxrc95/hitler_cuckoldry_and_racecars_the_story_of_the/", "is_self": true}
