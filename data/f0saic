This is probably the only sell I've regretted despite netting $4k.. and this isn't even the mistake I'm referring to from the title. I bought a July 1000c for TSLA on Tuesday 2/4 morning, and needless to say it's been a f\\*\\*\\*ing brutal week. Here a snapshot of my position from Tuesday afternoon, notice the $13415.00 cost:\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/OEd4X4e](https://imgur.com/a/OEd4X4e)\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo I sold a 2/7 1500c against it. I figured.. shit.. if I'm going to lose $8000+ on this guy, I might as well make a few hundred here and there. The week moves forward and Wednesday and Thursday morning were brutal, but Thursday afternoon something magical happened.. I wanted to close my 1500c because it's value had dropped so much, but I couldn't buy it back because TastyWorks wasn't done processing my $9k deposit from Tuesday (even though they were nice enough to let me trade with it.. to buy the 1000c). So, I opened an order to close that 1500c, and simultaneously opened a 2/7 1000c in the same order.. and I got a credit! Then TSLA spiked a little intraday, so I rolled that out to a 2/14 1500c for a credit! And so on...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've held this bleeding TSLA 1000c since 2/4, and with just trading FDs for a couple days I've managed to net $786. $431 of that which came on one day alone. Here is a snapshot of my activity:\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/Mw3V6AF](https://imgur.com/a/Mw3V6AF)\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\nMark my words autists. I \\*WILL\\* make my money back and will at least break even. And on the day I make back my losses with FDs, I'll go buy myself a fucking trophy and a chicken tenders dinner. Much love and thank God for Theta.\n\n\\&amp;nbsp;\n\nP.S. What does it take to get a Theta Gang flair? It seems fitting for me..", "created_utc": 1581172297, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f0saic/i_made_a_huge_mistake_and_im_going_to_undo_it/", "is_self": true}
