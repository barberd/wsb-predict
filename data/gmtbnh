I reckoned price would soon plummet back and opened an ITM credit spread position to collect easy money.\n\nToday when I saw notification from RH that ACB crashed I jumped with joy.  When I opened the app trying to close my position and locked in profit, I was very confused when I saw my position took a loss.
