Made around $1.1k from selling the options plus around $1.2k from the shares, so I'm not too sad about it getting exercised. But I wonder if this is because of the short squeeze and people wanted to get their hands on the shares before they mooned after the earnings", "created_utc": 1563947498, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ch45ut/bynd_covered_calls_0726180_got_early_exercised/", "is_self": true}
