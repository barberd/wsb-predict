Here are some fun practices JPM did in the 90s. \n\nNote: Im a non-finance scrub and likely messed up terms. \n\nCLO = CDO but now its \"high yield\" / risky corporate loan debt\n\n# SELLING CLOs\n\nThis relative was slinging CLO\u2019s at JPM back in the day. For example, fly south and pitch CLOs to an Argentine millionaire.\n\n1- JPM approaches wealthy client. Pitches them on CLO. \n\n2- Client is interested. Asks how much of the CLO JPM is keeping on their books (to ensure JPM has skin in the game) \n\n3- JPM will **guarantee** they hold a portion of the CLO to assuage client concerns while they sell the product, say 20%. Client feels safe because JPM is \u201csharing  the risk\u201d \n\n\u2026But what the client doesn\u2019t know is JPM then hedges their holding with a credit default swap and passes that risk along to someone else \ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd21\n\n# BONDS AND LOANS \n\nA bank can service a company in multiple ways. Two of them are: \n\n* Providing a loan (Corporate Lending) \n* Issuing bonds (Bond Department)  \n\nThis combo seems benign but allows for some major fuckery to occur.\n\nFor the following examples, we have: \n\n* Risky Company (IE Hertz).\n* Bank (IE JP Morgan)\n* Clients (IE Argentine millionaire)\n\nThe bank has issued **loans** to the company through Corporate Lending. They have also issued \"high-yield\" (risky) **bonds** on the companies behalf through their bond department. \n\n*The company then goes into restructuring.* \n\nFirst scheme: \n\nWhen the bank issued the bonds and sold them to clients, they were \u201con the clients side\u201d. But when the company goes into restructuring, loans are more senior to bonds in the debt hierarchy (loans get paid back first). Remember the bank was the lender as well as the bond issuer. Bank becomes the bondholders enemy and will fight for its debt to be serviced before any bonds are paid back.\n\nSecond scheme:\n\nThe bondholder in the restructuring company is typically counting on a soft commitment from the bank to \u201cmake a market\u201d and buy back the bonds in case of a restructure. The bondholder may be a company (Insurance Co) that is not allowed to hold low-rated assets on its books. They count on the bank to buy the shitty bonds back, for example at 60c on the dollar.\n\nHowever the company has entered loan re-structuring with the banks corporate lending department. Company is now \u201con the restricted list\u201d and the bank can no longer make a market for their client, screwing them again. \n\nThird Scheme\n\nInstead, the bank can act on an agency basis. They say \u201cI\u2019ll put some calls out and see if we have anyone interested in buying these bonds\u201d.\n\nThis is where **distressed debt** firms come in. These firms are \u201csome of the smartest guys out there\u201d. Jacked to the tits with quants and \u201csuper smart people\u201d they are able to determine through careful analysis how much the bond will realistically pay out after re-structuring, say 60c on the dollar. \n\nDistressed Debt firm proceeds to offer the bondholder 30c on the dollar. The client may be forced to take this deal to get the downgraded assets off their books. Later when the company restructures, the bond pays out 60c. Distressed debt firm doubles its investment 1-2 years later.", "created_utc": 1592104198.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h8m3g1/clos_at_jpm/", "is_self": true}
