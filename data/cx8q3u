{"id": "cx8q3u", "title": "Foolproof play that can't go tits up", "selftext": "Fake a resume, get hired by a network, get access to a huge TV set, get an overly dramatic cameraman that just randomly moves around and zooms in and out on you, practice your yelling, become the next Jim Cramer (worth $100 mil btw), and yell at people for an hour a day the absolute worst most terrible fucking advice like buy the shit out of ULTA. Bonus points for just yelling unintelligably so people can't call you out on bad advice. Delete tweets when you're wrong so only correct tweets are in your account and you look like fucking Nostradamus. If someone screenshotted bad advice, accuse them of doctoring it. Have some early tweets calling Twitter an unprofitable piece of shit company so if they ever confirm the bad tweets are accurate, you can point at those and say they have an agenda.\n\nGet huge ratings due to your yelling and camera guy and get ever-increasing fat ass paychecks. Can't go tits up because you're not playing anything. Worst they can do is fire you and you'd probably get a severance anyways. Get your shouting ass to the 9-figure club with ol' Jimmy C in no time.", "created_utc": 1567121110, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cx8q3u/foolproof_play_that_cant_go_tits_up/", "is_self": true}
