But I remember watching this guy who actually made money trading on the news, and he said to short Deutsche Bank because \u201cbanks can\u2019t shrink themselves to profitability\u201d, or something like that. Look it up, it was a meme. Anyways, it seems to me that this is what HSBC is trying to do, shrink themselves to profitability. Idk why that it doesn\u2019t work for banks, but there is that smart guy who says so. For what it\u2019s worth, look at DB\u2019s stock over the last few years, it tanked \n\nMy second but if DD is the fact that coronavirus and the HK riots have been relatively recent, 2019 only, and so you wouldn\u2019t think that they are going to affect HSBC so bad that they have to lay off nearly 10% of their work force. \n\nWhat makes this especially surprising in HSBC are HQ\u2019d in Asia, and that\u2019s where the flu n riots n shit is going on, but these job loses are going to be focused in Europe and America, not where the world\u2019s economy has been hit hardest.", "created_utc": 1582072935, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6256e/hsbc_puts/", "is_self": true}
