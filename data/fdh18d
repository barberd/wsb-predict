It's a combination of technical and fundamentals.\n\nFundamentals : This company made planes that no one really wanted \\*BEFORE\\* the coronavirus outbreak. What does this company do now?\n\nTechnicals: This isn't my work, I'm borrowing it, but it's been passed around plenty on Twitter. The infamous Diamond Top. It's like a Diamond Back rattle snake ready to strike, downward.\n\n1st target would be $200. Second target would be multi-year support at $140. \n\nSo essentially this company was having the worst year in decades BEFORE the coronavirus was a big deal. And then you add this once in a century coronavirus to a worst year in decades?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[$BA chart, I got up and made my own. Breakdown from diamond top very clear. ](https://preview.redd.it/ogv1iexdhpk41.png?width=1399&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e6fbb65d860b9de8b3b6070a1ea5b479318b63a)\n\n[$BA weak bounce after recent lows compared to rest of the market](https://preview.redd.it/bxs8ljsj4pk41.png?width=929&format=png&auto=webp&s=46a59a28aeec1d60f83ffe25a8db63b4df621d95)\n\nTLDR: They say tendies don't fall out of the sky, but I beg to differ.\n\nI only have one single put strike 3/13 $260 put because I think if shit really goes down, we're all going to get Robinhooded no matter what brokerage you use. Looking to see if anyone else has any different opinions.\n\nEdit: I made my own technical chart", "created_utc": 1583345345.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fdh18d/boeing_ba_about_to_get_dropped/", "is_self": true}
