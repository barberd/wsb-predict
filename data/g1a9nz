Ok, so DIS has <1/3 of the subscribers, but no big deal because they're growing fast. DIS had a marketcap of ~191bil, compared to  NFLX ~182 bil. Now the house of mouse has many more revenue avenues than Netflix and likely will be more comparable in subscribers in the coming years.\n\nEither Netflix is wildly over valued, or Disney is wildly undervalued. My bet is both, with DIS being basically a sure thing.", "created_utc": 1586886667.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1a9nz/dis_200c_012122/", "is_self": true}
