More posts are beginning to query people's mental health to ensure they don't so something stupid. Like this\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6uku3/i\\_may\\_have\\_lost\\_4m\\_but\\_the\\_fed\\_has\\_cost\\_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6uku3/i_may_have_lost_4m_but_the_fed_has_cost_this/)\n\nThis has probably been posted before but **these things will fuck you**.  Banish that shit from your mind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Assuming you would have sold at ATH\n\nYou see this all the time in crypto; *I bought in at 1 dollar and if only I held to $10,000 I would be a dickillionaire.*   [This comment has it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g76wkr/heavy_losses_since_nov_2019_from_tesla_shopify/fofai9k?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x).\n\nDon't do this.  If you bought in at a dollar and you doubled your investment you likely would have sold.  Or possibly you would have sold at 3X or 5X.  The idea that you would have held on for 1000X is ludicrous.  Gambling is not for long term investment. Options are not for long term investment. You wouldn't have sold at ATH so stop giving your future self a reach around when present you is getting bummed.\n\n# Equating the money to the real world.\n\nPoker players know this rule inside out.  Inside out.  **It is not real world money**.  It stopped being real world money the minute you put it in play.  It is not 6 month's rent.  It is not school tuition.  If you think like that you will fuck yourself up and your decision making will be destroyed.\n\nSet aside the money.  Say I am willing to YOLO it.  If you cannot do that; then take the real-world money back out and slap yourself for suffering from FOMO.  Look in the mirror and say 'I nearly gave away this money to some cunt trying to bankrupt me.  Fuck FOMO and fuck them'.\n\nIt is not real world money.  If it was real world money, it would not be in Robin Hood or TOS.\n\n# Waking up every 2 mins to check your account\n\nSee above.  If this is stopping you from sleeping then your strategy and approach is fuk.\n\nSet your stop losses or whatever and sleep soundly.  Market goes up and down; the only thing that should affect you is..***.did it hit my entry or exit point?***  That's it.  Until one of those things happens; who gives a fuck?  Enjoy memes and sleep.\n\n# Refusing to learn from the experience\n\nPrinciples.  Feedback loops.  If you lose money, take a few days to emotionally recover.  Then work out what happened and why.  The answer is never *the market*.  I have lost 60% of my bankroll being a bear but I have learned so much about the Federal Reserve and credit generation.  I will never make this mistake again. [https://www.aier.org/article/powells-new-monetary-regime/](https://www.aier.org/article/powells-new-monetary-regime/)\n\nA poster on this very forum said \"You have never seen a face-ripping rally like a bull rally out of a drop\".  Even u/variation-separate told WSB what would happen from 220 to 280.\n\nYou paid for this so learn from it.  Are you an options trader, really?  Or are you a buy and hold investor in the wrong way of investing?  Or are you a penny stock picker in the wrong forum?  Have a real think.\n\n# Most important...it is just fucking money.  That's all. It is nothing.\n\nInternalise that.  If a central bank can literally print it out of thin air through credit swaps; why would you hurt yourself over it?  Fuck that shit and fuck them.  And fuck everybody that got a problem with Mike Lowry.  Get up and take it to the max everyday.\n\nIt is just money and as long you are not homeless and starving; fortunes can change in an instant.\n\n**Staying in the game (life) is more important than the scoreline.** All you need to do is die with a single dollar to have come out ahead. Personally I hope I am overdrawn at my bank... :-)\n\nYou can still cook a kick-ass meal, drink rum, hug your kids, enjoy the sun, all that shit.  As a kid my family was homeless 3 times.  People get through.  You live on peanut butter sandwiches for a month.\n\nStone Cold Steve Austin was down to his last 100 dollars and paid for a sack of potatoes and his gym membership to keep up his calories and routine.  Sylvester Stallone had to sell his fucking dog he was so poor and the Rock was down to his last 7 bucks.  Watch this video, shut the fuck up and come back strong.

Don't be an autist.  Be like Mike Lowry.\n\nI wanna be I wanna be like Mike.\n\nPositions: [SPX 1700 6 Months](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/fwvt54/sp_1700_within_6_months/) \\- Bulls r fuk and only cunts hold $USO.
