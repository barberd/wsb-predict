{"id": "fb5vjz", "title": "I found this interesting re: QQQ today. Fuck if I know if it is interesting to you.", "selftext": "So full disclosure; I have an option put position in QQQ for Mar 2021.  I got lucky with timing, so not posting to brag.  Just assume I am an idiot for your own safety.  Maybe I give it all back next week, who fucking knows when the VIX was as high as 48+ this week. I was a bear before it was cool to be a bear in this market.  But, I'm telling you this so you know why I am paying attention to QQQ.\n\n[My QQQ position - yes, I am a pussy who doesn't YOLO.  I haven't hit my head hard enough to be fully autistic yet.  My bad.](https://preview.redd.it/o0z389ojlrj41.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d4a76213c1dfa663cf30f518da17d3032d11ab5)\n\nSo now that we established, that I am interested in QQQ market movement, I noticed something interesting today @ market close:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Nice action from 200 to 205 in the last 15 minutes of a shit week.](https://preview.redd.it/b0bvd5p4mrj41.png?width=634&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76c1830288787fa2739b3ef8d0ed2115835959ba)\n\n\\- So I assumed originally that this was bear shorts closing their position on a monster week and getting out of dodge of the inevitable rate cut from Jesus (played by Jerome Powell).\n\n\\- Or maybe it was a bull who wanted to get a jump on positive action for next week.\n\nThen I looked at options.  We started the week @ 221 more or less.\n\nNear the money:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uzp4riutmrj41.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0bb4f51ed436f19da2c365d9d48c389b292c7d3\n\nWider view:\n\n[That is a lot of volume around 205.](https://preview.redd.it/the77njlmrj41.png?width=976&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03b3548e417171818fa778e2abd0cefbe96529ac)\n\nSo anything below 206 expired out of the money this week.  But to get there, someone had to make a HEAVY lift from \\~200 to 205 in the last 15 minutes.  If you sold a put between 221 and 206, you are already in the shit and probably failed to defend earlier this week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Fuck anyone below 206.](https://preview.redd.it/rdwq7h71orj41.png?width=938&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42cb59a9b1e1c0343e4e5080f8d8337739581cc0)\n\nSo, tin foil hat on, this info made me ask some questions to myself.  Because I talk to myself.  I'm not well, and don't have many friends:\n\n\\- Why did 200 - 205 get taken out 15 minutes prior to close?  Was it defensive hedge fund X who was avoiding having to eat those put contracts, or was it some (soon to be) poor institution who had to cover between 206 and 221 and took out the stack when it was clear that hope was dead, and bears run the market right now?\n\n\\- Was one person or institution holding the 200 - 205 bag for option puts in QQQ? I can't believe too many people got together to punch through the stack in the last 15 minutes for shits and giggles after the week we had.\n\n\\- If so, how much of the following bags are this group holding for the next 7 days?  And who else is out there to get in front of this shit show?  You need balls of steel or rampant stupidity to stick your neck out here as far as I am concerned.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nl8en5q6wrj41.png?width=970&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=301b573efcb2f56cdb864d687bb1e637fecb5bba\n\nI think the action next week in QQQ will tell us a lot about the market.  If we retrace back up from here, then maybe the sky is NOT falling and I need to check my own beliefs.  But if we start punching thru all of these put option open interest AGAIN for a second straight week, I am not sure where the bloodletting stops.\n\nI marked this post as a shitpost because I am not qualified to give you advice.  Don't be a fucking idiot, I have no idea what is going to happen next week.", "created_utc": 1582943519, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fb5vjz/i_found_this_interesting_re_qqq_today_fuck_if_i/", "is_self": true}
