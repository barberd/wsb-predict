This shits literally numbers on a screen at this point. Fuckin monthly dues to RH on the account of a bunch of dumb fucks on an app.     My first post here was a question about dividends... fucking dividends, you can\u2019t make this shit up hahaha. But I\u2019ve grown. 3 months ago I had no fucking clue what a call was, so naturally bought 10 $MSFT 220c 4/17. (Still Holding lol F) That was my first play and I\u2019m still waiting on that free one everyone\u2019s been raving about. Made my money back on ALB puts because some random fuck asked \u201cshould I sell my X $ALB call?\u201d So I checked RH, mind you I have no fucking clue what ALB is at this point, check the 3 month chart and see it\u2019s extremely high, fuck it I\u2019m in on puts. They printed and I\u2019ve been obsessed ever since then. I know I\u2019m not a baller, but god damn these small gains got my bussy wet. I never knew how much I needed this sub until the \ud83c\udf08 boys made it private for half a minute. All I do is refresh wsb and watch red charts all day and I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. \n\n\nThank you for everything you retarded, beautiful fucks.\n\n\n$SPY 200p 4/17", "created_utc": 1584433004.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fk1lp3/paying_my_respects/", "is_self": true}
