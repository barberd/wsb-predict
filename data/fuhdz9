{"id": "fuhdz9", "title": "Why I think that USO is going to be a huge play over the next few months...", "selftext": "I have been reviewing how the USO ETF works within its relationship to the WTI Crude futures. \n\nEach month, the ETF sells its futures and buys new futures for the next month out. One of the big challenges is that contango (when the actual price of the commodity is lower than the futures face value) can eat into the assests of the fund.\n\nI think that starting now, contango will actually invert into backward-retardation, as the price of WTI will keep rising over the next few months.\n\nUSO's previous futures roll took place 06 March 2020 thru 11 March 2020. The front month futures prices on those dates were $41.28, $31.13, $34.36, $32.98, respectively.\n\nUSO's futures roll for April will take place 07 April 2020 thru 13 April 2020. As of today, the front-month futures price is $29.00.\n\nThat's why the \"bottom\" part of the post is so important. I think we have bounced and are going to move up. If not this coming week, then definitively over the next month. If I have to eat a small bit of contango this month, so be it, but I have a high degree of confidence that I won't.", "created_utc": 1585950935.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fuhdz9/why_i_think_that_uso_is_going_to_be_a_huge_play/", "is_self": true}
