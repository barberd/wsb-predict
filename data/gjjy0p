This is in comparison to both statements by the companies and to predictions from many buy-side analysts, namely ARK Invest and Baron Funds.\n\n\\-----------------------------\n\n# tl;dr:\n\n2030 predictions excluding AMaas: >!$5235 share price from $591B revenue, $158B profit, $1.6T market cap!<\n\n2030 predictions including AMaas: >!$24844 share price from $1.28T revenue, $365B profit, $5.8T market cap!<\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**major notes:**\n\npredicted 1.2m vehicle sales 2024 is 40% of Musk's stated expectation of 3m\n\nAMaaS release 5yrs behind Musk's original timeline\n\npredicted auto production growth is 35-40% yoy, Musk has stated that he expects 50% yoy\n\n% AMaaS vehicles on network and hrs/week could be 2-3x realistically once safety and owner profitability has been proven\n\ncomparing EV/EBIT and P/S ratios to similar growth companies and the total market in general (as of Feb20) portrays the predicted 2030 valuations as extremely conservative and could realistically be 1.5-3x\n\nvehicle and energy production costs (and thus gross margins) have been modelled in line with Wright's Law; prices have been modelled to steadily decline with costs - alternatively, Tesla could maintain prices and allow their margins to increase much faster\n\n^(\\^these points and many others are further explained within the Notes section of the spreadsheet)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDespite my longer term (4-10 years) expectations remaining unchanged, here are my model updates for 2020 estimates specifically regarding potential CoViD impact:\n\n>**2020 estimates pre-CoViD:**  \n>  \n>Auto Total #: 520000  \n>  \n>Auto ASP: $55000  \n>  \n>Auto Gross Margin: 21%  \n>  \n>Energy MWh deployed: 2700  \n>  \n>Energy $/MWh: $735  \n>  \n>Energy Gross Margin: 15%  \n>  \n>EOY Share Price: $1088  \n>  \n>**2020 estimates post-CoViD:**  \n>  \n>Auto Total #: 419000 (-20%)  \n>  \n>Auto ASP: $49000 (-11%)  \n>  \n>Auto Gross Margin: 20% (-5%)  \n>  \n>Energy MWh deployed: 2160 (-20%)  \n>  \n>Energy $/MWh: $698 (-5%)  \n>  \n>Energy Gross Margin: 15% (no change)  \n>  \n>EOY Share Price: $806 (-26%)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExpect another update in the next couple of weeks following Battery Investor Day. The date for this event is yet to be confirmed, however it has long been expected April or May. It may not occur until early-June, however Musk maintains that they will be revealing some of the most important battery-related plans and information of Tesla's history. I am expecting long-term plans to be revealed for multi-TWh battery production in the next decade, allowing for something ridiculous like 20M vehicles\u00a0*annually.* If they reveal anything crazy like this I'll definitely be updating the model with that kind of growth.\n\n***-----------------------------***\n\n*full disclosure, I've a current share price buy target of* ***$875 USD*** *with the expectation of that to* ***sextuple by 2030*** *excluding revenue from Autonomous MaaS*\n\n*i of course must also say that i have no idea what i'm talking about + that you should take everything in these spreadsheets with a mouthful of salt water, making no investment decisions based on me nor my numbers.*", "created_utc": 1589452926.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gjjy0p/my_tsla_valuation_model_predicting_a_2030_share/", "is_self": true}
