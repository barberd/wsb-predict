{"id": "f6wvk7", "title": "$STMP What do you think is going on?", "selftext": "Stamps.com is a somewhat unique firm. End of the day, they are in the industry of providing postal service. Their service very specifically falls into the postal service industry. Despite Stamps.com's unique spot in the market and supply chain of the service the consumer actually is purchasing, we need to look at comps. UPS has been trading for over 10 years with a very sideways P/E that hasn't gone much beyond 20, other than two obviously burst bubbles ([Macrotrends](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/UPS/ups/pe-ratio), 2020).\n\n$STMP's current P/E reflects an S/P 500 type P/E. Unrealistic, rarely holding the test of time. If we use the current estimates for years end EPS, we get a P/E of 30, normal for a stable S/P company  ([Imbert](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/20/stampscom-jumps-more-than-50percent-thursday-a-year-after-crashing-nearly-50percent-in-a-single-day.html), 2020). Those estimates at that EPS should be discounted to reach a more reasonable value. Discounting the the value (assuming Stamps deserves the 30 P/E because of their unique spot in the market) a reasonable present value for stamps is $132.85 per share. It is trading way above that. My discount rate was 1.75% per month, based off of $SPY performance.\n\nWith this said, I believe the stock is outrageously overvalued, it has seen major corrections in the past when reaching points of resistance and will again correct. Sharply. This current value seems too good to be true. My assumptions in this basic model are too good to be true. Probably a stock I would long, but only below $130 at this point of the year.
