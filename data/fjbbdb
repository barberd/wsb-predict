The Fed can reduce the rates another 3% and pay us, and it won't make a fucking difference. People are waking up to the fact this is a three month lockdown of the American Economy, as well as the global economy, and we're going to see a massive fucking downturn. Whether or not this virus was intentionally released or not, can be debated later on in life, but for now, we're seeing an all out economic war taking place in the markets. A mother fucking army of bears just emerged like the god damn Uruk Hai. So what are we going to see? \n\nAny leisure company, completely fucked. travel, luxury, vacation, cruises, etc.\n\nHousing is gonna plummet, who the fuck would buy in this time?\n\nOil and gas, no one is driving, industries are shuttering, oil is gonna see a low 2 handle, possible a 1 handle by mid summer. \n\nTech- who the fuck is making technology? Apple shut their stores down, you think people are buying computers and iPhones right now? No, they're trying to buy fucking toilet paper. \n\nStreamers are a terrible idea. There's not much profit, and all asset classes are going to be devalued. There's literally nowhere in the market you can go for safety right now. Except one thing:\n\nGold. Gold miners (oil collapse creates large margins). They'll plummet a bit with the market, but then once the Beer Virus passes, they're gonna be sitting on mountains of gold they mined for cheap, in a time when gold is surging from all the QE and printing of money from every central bank. \n\nSpy puts pay out all the way down to 180 in early May.\n\nLVS going to 20 by early May\n\nSLB, RIG, have no need to even be in business. \n\nRCL isn't getting bailed out, if there's an industry not getting a fucking Trump bailout, it's the motherfucking cruise lines. People are dying, fuck the boats. \n\nDIS is gonna be in the 60s and people will cry for Iger, as if Big Dick Bob could have done something else. \n\nWSBGOD's big short 2.0, here we go to the next leg down.", "created_utc": 1584316766.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjbbdb/get_ready_for_the_bloodiest_week_in_the_history/", "is_self": true}
