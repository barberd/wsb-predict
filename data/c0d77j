{"id": "c0d77j", "title": "Shorts mechanics", "selftext": "This is a mechanics question about shorts, I have never shorted I buy puts and sell calls. I have an RH account so I do not have access to shorting. My question is when a singular investor shorts are you being floated the money that would have been granted in the sale of the stock as a loan from the brokerage you use or are you actually selling borrowed shares?\n\nMy second question only applies if you are selling borrowed shares, if this is the case why would a large enough short not be able to be opened to directly effect the over all price of a stock so that you could immediately turn it around into a profit? Are the brokerages using market maker tools instead of direct market and limit orders; so the shares never technically hit the active market?", "created_utc": 1560469715, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c0d77j/shorts_mechanics/", "is_self": true}
