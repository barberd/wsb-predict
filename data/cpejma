{"id": "cpejma", "title": "BYND Aramark inks contract to offer Beyond faux meat", "selftext": "Likely the reason for the pop today. IB has 54k shares available to short and a borrow rate of 61%, so the short squeeze thesis is in reverse at the moment. (borrow rate is falling) but looks like new contracts bailing them out, for today, at least.  Aramark serves 2bn meals a year. So even a small penetration rate can have a pretty big impact on BYND numbers without the need to pay for shelf space.\n\nArticle from Fox Business:\n\nPlant-based protein options are becoming more widely available as the popularity of faux meats has begun to surge.\n\nNow, food service provider Aramark says it will offer [**Beyond Meat**](https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/food-and-beverage) burgers, sausages and other items on its menus at schools, [**hospitals,**](https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/health-care) ballparks and other businesses. The deal has the potential to bring Beyond Meat\u2019s foods to many new diners, as Aramark said it serves nearly 2 billion meals each year.\n\nAramark\u2019s Beyond Meat offerings include a gumbo bowl with Beyond Sausage for hospital patients, a Caribbean-inspired Beyond Burger with black beans, avocado, pineapple and Sriracha sold at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Beyond Sausage with fried shallots at Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City and Beyond Sausage brats at Citi Field in Queens, New York.\n\n\u201cThe trick for us is to develop and offer unique meatless options that taste great and appeal to consumers who might want to try something new and those who follow plant-forward diets,\u201d said Heidi Hogan, Aramark\u2019s vice president of product development and culinary innovation.\n\nThe company said it has found that 60 percent of consumers want to [**reduce**](https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/lifestyle-and-budget) their meat consumption. Many of them pointed to health and weight management as their reasons for cutting back on meat.\n\n\u201cEarly on, we understood that consumer preferences were driving a need for quality plant-forward offerings and our culinary team has been working with a broad range of plant-based products to create more enticing menu choices,\u201d Hogan said.\n\nThe announcement came just days after Aramark competitor [**Sodexo**](https://www.foxbusiness.com/features/impossible-burger-coming-to-schools-hospitals) announced a partnership with Beyond Meat competitor Impossible Foods.\n\nAramark said it had already been working on a \u201cplant-forward initiative\u201d aimed at lowering greenhouse gas emissions. The company said it has developed more than 200 new plant-based recipes and that 30 percent of its menu offerings are now vegan or vegetarian.\n\nThe food service provider has also recently partnered with plant-based egg replacement maker JUST and Ocean Hugger Foods, which makes plant-based tuna alternative Ahimi, for temporary additions to its menus at some higher education and corporate facilities.\n\nSauce: [https://www.foxbusiness.com/features/beyond-meat-menus-ballparks-hospitals-schools-aramark](https://www.foxbusiness.com/features/beyond-meat-menus-ballparks-hospitals-schools-aramark)", "created_utc": 1565626505, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cpejma/bynd_aramark_inks_contract_to_offer_beyond_faux/", "is_self": true}
