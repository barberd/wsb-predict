I'm really into gaming I want to get an AMD processor (probably a Ryzen 7) but they're kind of expensive. I heard from r/investing that buying stocks for a company means you actually OWN a part of that company? I decided I would buy AMD stocks so I could ask them for a cpu since I would then own a part of them. Then I heard from some cute girl on CNBC that you guys figured out a way to buy AMD??? Anyway I'm gonna follow exactly what that guy who did the 'GUH' sound did and do that 'leverage' thing since I just got approved for Robinhood Gold! Then I can ask AMD for a new Ryzen 3800 XT since I will own them! Thanks for the guidance!", "created_utc": 1573053843, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dshrv0/gamers_should_profit_off_this/", "is_self": true}
