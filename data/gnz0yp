{"id": "gnz0yp", "title": "Alcohol DD", "selftext": " \n\n**TLDR**\n\nThe four companies that I looked at are BUD, TAP, STZ, and SAM. Alcohol sales go up during recession, consumers have shown a recent trend of valuing high end products in the alcohol sector, there are a lot of alcohol companies with large debt to earnings ratios. SAM appears to have the best debt stance, product line, and conservative ownership. This DD does not tell the whole picture and was done somewhat hastily so expect grammatical and formatting errors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n| Company ticker and market cap | TTM EBITDA| DEBT |Cash on   hand| DEBT: EBITDA | TTM EPS | PE |\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|BUD 71B|15B|97B|7B|6|1.69|27|\n|TAP 8.28B|1.3B|9.5B|0.66B|6.8|\\-0.13|0|\n|STZ 32B|2.5B|11B|0.081B|5.5|\\-0.18|0|\n|SAM 6.4B|0.2B|0.1B|0.13B|0.2|8.6|60|\n\n**Statistics and premises**\n\nI did a little DD recently on alcohol stocks. My primary concern right now with companies is debt. My assumptions are that there will be decreased consumer confidence and in turn decreased spending over this period of uncertainty. My primary focus was on Alcohol companies\u2019 debt and their future ability to pay that off which will allow them to pivot into new market opportunities.\n\nOther statistical foundations that I looked at include consumer preferences, and alcohol sales during recession. Sales of alcohol were down 1.6% during 2019. This was before Covid happened. However, sales of craft beer were up 3.6% YoY and sales of import beer were up 1.8% YoY. This indicates to me that the craft beer hype is still abound. Consumers want to purchase high quality beer and spirits. ([https://www.brewersassociation.org/statistics-and-data/national-beer-stats/](https://www.brewersassociation.org/statistics-and-data/national-beer-stats/)).\n\nAlcohol sales thrive during a recession. A snippet from a 2011 CNN money article that highlights increased sales of alcohol during the 2008 financial crisis:\n\n*\"Sales expanded more than 9% in 2008, the first full year of the recession, when the average unemployment rate was 5.8%. Sales slumped dramatically the following year, but were still 1% higher, as the unemployment rate shot up to about 9.3%. In 2010, sales jumped more than 9% as unemployment grew to 9.6%.\"*\n\nWe are apparently seeing increased sales in the past three weeks as well, \"Total alcoholic beverages rose 35% Y/Y for the week ending May 9 to mark the third consecutive week of accelerating sales, per Nielsen data.\"\n\n([https://money.cnn.com/2011/06/08/news/companies/alcohol\\_sales/index.htm](https://money.cnn.com/2011/06/08/news/companies/alcohol_sales/index.htm))\n\n**BUD**\n\nBUD, or Budweiser, is known for their name brand. Bud light, Budweiser, bud lime etc. They also produce Michelob, rolling rock, Busch, shock top, and a dozen other names. Their portfolio includes craft beers such as Goose Island, Blue point, Elysian, and many others. BUD is the monster in the beer industry. Their market cap is 71 billion dollars, dwarfing the second largest in this list by right around 40 billion dollars. BUD also has relatively good earnings per share for the trailing twelve months at $1.60. Their earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization is also strong for the trailing twelve months at $15 billion.\n\nHowever, BUD, in my opinion, is over leveraged right now. Their strategic plan of acquiring dozens of breweries in the past has resulted in an accumulation of 97 billion dollars in debt. Take that in, their market cap is 71 billion dollars and they have 97 billion dollars in debt. Yes, they have over 200 billion dollars in non-cash assets; however, my premise is that companies do not want debt right now as it will inhibit their ability to be flexible with increased market and consumer volatility. BUD has a debt to EBITDA ratio of 6. Which is not good.\n\nA second detractor is that BUD's EBITDA has decreased 6 out of the last 7 quarters on a TTM basis. BUD's earnings have been down for the past two years. Slowing earnings coming into this Covid time introduces even more uncertainty.\n\n**TAP**\n\nTAP, or Molson Coors beverage, is known for Coors, killians, keystone, and blue moon. They have 21 brands of beer in north America and the UK. TAP\u2019s market cap is 8.28 billion. TAP\u2019s TTM EPS is -0.13. Since September of 2018, their earnings have been drilling down. Their TTM EBITDA is $1.36 billion.\n\nAgain, TAP is debt heavy. TAP has $9.5 billion dollars in debt and has a debt to EBITDA ratio worse than BUD at 6.8. TAP has very few reasons to buy under my assumptions. Their product is not high end except for blue moon. Their hard seltzer, Vizzt, has just rolled out and has a lot of ground to make up to catch up in market share. Keystone, Coors, and killians are not high-end products and if the trend of non-craft or import beer continues to decline, I think TAP could be the worse off in this bunch.\n\n**STZ**\n\nSTZ, also known as constellation brands, is interesting. STZ is known for Corona beer, Modello, and ballast point. Ballast point is a collection of high-end craft beers. STZ is more than just beer though. They sell high end wine and spirits as well. The list of high-end spirits and wine is long and includes Kim Crawford, Robert Mondavi, black box wines, Svedka, and dozens of other high-end products. STZ has also shown interest in the cannabis market by purchasing 38.6% of canopy growth company\u2019s issued and outstanding shares. They have further warrants, that if exercised, would result in a 55.8% ownership of issued and outstanding shares of CGC. STZ has a market cap of $32 billion, TTM EBITDA of $2.5b, $11b in debt, debt to EBITDA of 5.5 and a TTM EPS of -0.18. STZ is also reporting in their most recent earnings report that they plan to return $4.5b to investors in the form of dividends and stock buy backs. Take that as you will.\n\n([https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Constellation+Brands+%28STZ%29+Exercises+Warrants+to+Acquire+Shares+in+Canopy+Growth+%28CGC%29/16822343.html](https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Constellation+Brands+%28STZ%29+Exercises+Warrants+to+Acquire+Shares+in+Canopy+Growth+%28CGC%29/16822343.html))\n\nThe past two quarters for STZ have been rough in terms of EBITDA and EPS. I would need to dive deeper into the earnings report to identify why. Their YOY quarterly growth is in strong decline for the past two quarters, and like the three previously mentioned companies, in decline for the past year. Out of the three mentioned up to now I think STZ has the best outlook though. They have a diversified product line with beer, wine, and spirits, they have unique growth opportunity with CGC, and they have high end alcohol products. Also, according to STZ CEO, there is no headwind in name brand Corona with the macro events. Bill Newlands was quoted by Yahoo finance saying, \u201cRecent data show our Corona brand is up over 20%. So very strong performance\u201d.\n\n([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/corona-beer-sales-on-fire-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic-constellation-brands-ceo-171135420.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/corona-beer-sales-on-fire-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic-constellation-brands-ceo-171135420.html))\n\n**SAM**\n\nSAM, known as Boston Beer company, is the second largest craft brewer in the country and the largest publicly traded. Their products include the Samuel Adams line up of craft beers, Twisted Tea, Angry Orchard, Truly, and they recently merged with Dogfish Head. SAM has a market cap of $6.4 billion, TTM EBITDA of $0.2 billion, $0.1 billion in debt, this was zero until this last quarter, debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.2, and a TTM EPS of 8.6.\n\nIn four of the last six quarters SAM have had YoY quarterly growth. The quarterly EBITDA growth percentages were 50%, 91%, 16%, and 26%. STZ had only one quarter of YoY EBITDA growth @ 11%, TAP had only one quarter of YoY EBITDA growth @ 48%, BUD had only one quarter of YoY EBITDA growth in the same 6 quarters @ 4%. SAM is crushing it. They have a line up of high-quality craft beers and also have the second best selling hard seltzer in Truly. Hard seltzer sales are growing at a staggering rate. Sales of hard seltzers were up 200% the year prior to July 2019. Dollar sales of the hard seltzer category were up 334% Y/Y for the week ending May 9th 2020.\n\n([https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/beer-companies-stocks-best-for-hard-seltzer-boom-ubs-2019-7-1028400172](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/beer-companies-stocks-best-for-hard-seltzer-boom-ubs-2019-7-1028400172))\n\nBoston Beer Company is in a great situation right now. They are near debt free which will allow them to be flexible in the uncertain times, they are expanding as evidenced by merging with Dogfish, they have high quality beer, and they are one of the two key players in the hard seltzer boom. My DD leads me to the conclusion that SAM is in a great position for future growth.", "created_utc": 1590075250.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gnz0yp/alcohol_dd/", "is_self": true}
