So as many of you know, the fed will make their announcement tomorrow and right now the odds are 50/50 going either way. So I was thinking what if you went deep on $300 SPY puts that expires on Friday and wait around 15 mins or so prior to the announcement to buy them and then set a stop loss so your max loss would be say 20% or maybe even 10%. Example, buying a 1.50 put and placing the stop loss at 1.20 or even 1.35. Could this actually work?? Or even possibly hedge a call/put with a 10/20% stop loss on each order (which I would assume would only result in a 10-20% max risk unless the market doesn\u2019t respond at all in the event of a cut happening)? I have thought of doing this play pre-ER but the order would never fill since it\u2019s either premarket or after hours. This, however, will be during trading hours. Thoughts? Comments? Also, if this is the miracle trade, YOLO.", "created_utc": 1568779135, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d5sax6/stop_loss_options_play_on_fed_news/", "is_self": true}
