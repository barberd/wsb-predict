{"id": "fll370", "title": "Thanks for help! Up about 200k in a month or so.", "selftext": "Just an average dude with a family trying to get by. Got lucky a few years ago with CGC back when they were an OTC and I had to call to place the order after convincing him I wasn't a total moron (jury is still out). \n\nAnyways, been lurking on here for years with nothing to share until now. \n\nFunded my dormant RH account with $1500 about 2 months ago to learn about options.  Got lucky with TSLA and SPCE only to get greedy and lose the 15k. Then came the \ud83c\udf7a\ud83e\udda0. I had been telling everyone I knew this shit is fucked (I work in military medicine. Not a MD). Moved all my main investments into cash/bonds blah blah. \n\n\nRH - $1500 > $43k. Took some profits and $1k to fund my TD account after forced diamond hands [RH screen shot](https://i.imgur.com/vhIQzLo.png)\n\n\nTD - $1k > $8800 [TD screen shot ](https://i.imgur.com/P6idq2u.png)\n\n\nVanguard - $15k > $151k. Still kept my IIPR shares, but liquidated everything else prior which gave me 15k to play with. Took some profits to pay off the minivan (who needs a Tesla). [Vanguard screen shot](https://i.imgur.com/haXGzp8.png)\n\nEdit: I submitted before finishing. I've still got about 200k in student loans that are forgiven in 2 years. So I am just about at my max gains before I possibly fuck my income based loans. So next stop is YOLOing the RH account. Million or bust at this point unless anyone knows a way to shelter some of these taxable gains. For those who like to talk about retirement funds, already maxing my TSP this year.", "created_utc": 1584663666.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fll370/thanks_for_help_up_about_200k_in_a_month_or_so/", "is_self": true}
