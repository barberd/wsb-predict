However, I would like to assign this man more values. To be honest, I had no idea who he was before the crash and I, too, only cared for him for his printing skills. However, after watching numerous speeches and hearings, I have developed much respect for the man. This man does his DD, has clear visions and much conviction, and, above all, does not lie to avoid tough questions. He is a hard working individual with integrity carrying out a task during one of the most challenging times in economic history. I have no doubt that the economy will crash soon, but I still would like to applaud this man for his vigilance and conviction.", "created_utc": 1592372816.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hal747/good_read_on_our_man_powell/", "is_self": true}
