{"id": "fel4k9", "title": "Just yolo'd IMAX puts for 10K, BYE", "selftext": "Let me preface by saying that I hate 3D, IMAX, flashing phone screens during movies, kids blowing each other in the theater, and loud popcorn chewing.  In a way, I am a natural-born IMAX shorter.  I love movies but hate movie theaters.  But a lot of people do like the movie-going experience, so companies like IMAX exist.\n\nSince I've been looking for a good yolo opportunity and saw that IMAX was one of the few garbage stocks that was not down today, I promptly interpreted that as a green light to destroy what was left of my money after going long on RCL three weeks ago (could not post that fun story here because I was banned from wsb at the time).\n\nToday I yolo'd in the worst possible way, with no fundamentals research whatsoever, just looked at the 52-week chart and dank I went.  Also got raped on the 10/35 cent spread, but I wanted to get these trades in before the weekend.  Tested with small 20 and 25 cent orders, all of which just set off the algos to fuck with me, so I said fuck it and upped to 30 cents at 3:58pm.  I basically paid a 150% premium over earlier today, but I believe IMAX will get the worst of the upcoming panic and my gains in the next 2 weeks will be at least 30%.  Would have loved them at 200% but oh well, I\u2019ll catch some on the way back.\n\nP.S. I could have sworn my buy price was 30 cents, but confirmations say 25.  I probably don't know what I'm doing.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/Y4hWb1B", "created_utc": 1583532363.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fel4k9/just_yolod_imax_puts_for_10k_bye/", "is_self": true}
