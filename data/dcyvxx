{"id": "dcyvxx", "title": "PSA for those switching to TDA from RH", "selftext": "Back in the day when I first switched I believe RH charged a $70 transfer fee to move all assets to TDA. TDA will cover this fee for you- just ask. \n\nAfter you open a TDA account send them a message or use the chat feature in thinkorswim, and say you\u2019re going to be transferring assets from a different broker who charges a transfer fee, would you be able to cover this fee for me. \n\nI\u2019m assuming this works for other brokers as well.
