{"id": "f17rbu", "title": "Credit/Debit spread clarification", "selftext": "I know what sub I'm in but I think that there's also valid people on here who can answer.\n\n\nI'm studying options and I saw credit and debit spreads.\n\nFrom my understanding:\n\n*CALL DEBIT SPREADS*: are like being bullish on a stock and buying calls on it but also writing higher strike calls to get a discount, and in case you get assigned you just gain the difference between the two strikes thus capping your gains, if the stock doesn't hit ur long call strike you lose the call's money-short calls premium. Max gain is if the price goes higher than the short call, max loss if it stays under the long call strike.\n\n*CALL CREDIT SPREADS*: you are bearish on a stock so you write calls on it but to cap the loss you buy higher strike calls, you earn the short call premium-the long call premium u paid. Max loss is if the price stays in between the two strikes because if it goes higher than the long call strike you offsett a part of the loss with the long call gains, max gain if it stays below the short call strike.\n\n*PUT DEBIT SPREAD*: you are bearish on a stock and buy puts but also write puts on a lower strike to get a discount. \nMax loss is if the stock stays over the long put strike, max gain if the stock goes under the short put strike.\n\n*PUT CREDIT SPREAD*: you are bullish on a stock so you write puts on it, but to cap the potential loss you also buy puts on a lower strike.\nMax gain is if the stock stays higher than the short put strike, max loss is if it stays in between the two strikes for the same reason as above.\n\n\nBut also credit put spreads are more dangerous than credit call spreads because if you get assigned you are holding stock(that may go up offsetting a part of the loss but also go down more) while with call spreads you just realize a loss and that's it.\n\n\n\nAre there any tips one should know about trading options?\nLike when to close positions or unexpected events that may occur?\n(A post from a guy who got assigned while in Mexico and went long on some stock on margin comes to my mind).\n\nYou need to have some collateral money to pay for the stock in case you get assigned right?", "created_utc": 1581249659, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f17rbu/creditdebit_spread_clarification/", "is_self": true}
