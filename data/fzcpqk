Your wife is three doors down seeing her boyfriend, and you're at home reading /r/wallstreetbets because you are constantly finding new sources of misinformation to lose your tendies on an uninterrupted basis.\n\nWhich brings me to this very important point. **Why the fuck do markets close at all?**\n\nWhy can't we lose tendies on a Saturday if we want to? Why can't we lose tendies after 4pm if we want to? Why the fuck would the system give us time to re-evaluate our decision to jack ourselves to the tits with these useless puts? The very system that worships capitalism like it's the son of Dr. Adam Smith and Mrs. Benjamin Franklin, seems to also be kind enough to gives us 2 (and sometimes 3) days to not lose anything????? WHY? THIS MAKES NO SENSE!\n\nI hereby petition to open the markets 24/7! Petition to let us lose our tendies on our own accord! Petition to get rammed by the long dick of the market all day... and night!\n\nOPEN THE GODDAMN MARKETS!!!\n\nLet the greed wash down my saliva through my digestive system and out the pp hole! PETITION WITH ME MY FELLOW AUTISTS!!!!\n\n**Edit:** This is a shitpost. If anything, what I'm saying is, this is the best time to reevaluate your positions.", "created_utc": 1586629120.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fzcpqk/fellow_autists_i_need_you_all_for_an_utterly/", "is_self": true}
