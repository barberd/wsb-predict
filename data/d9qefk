Just kidding, nobody can help with that.\n\nFor those of you that have switched from the glamorous lifestyle of purchasing FDs/weeklies and letting them expire worthless over to team Theta Gang, I bring you my latest tool - the credit spread scanner (like finding your mom on tinder).\n\n# How It Works\n\nHead over to the [SwaggyStonks - Credit Spread Scanner Tool](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocks/credit-spread-scanner)\n\n**Step 1:** Search the ticker you are thinking of selling a spread on and collecting that sweet premium.\n\n\\*Note: Due to some data constraints I normally track \"popular\" options tickers and those of stocks that have market caps greater than 5B+. I also want to focus on options that have higher liquidity.\n\n\\*Update: I should have almost all tickers searchable within the next 7-10 days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 2:** From there you can filter: Expiration Dates, Spread Side (Calls or Puts), and minimum OTM percentage you want to sell (helps refine the data for stocks with high volatility).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 3:** Read through the data in the table to help find the \"sweet spot\" for where you want sell that spread and munch away on theta.\n\n# How to interpret the data\n\nThe data within the cells is broken down into 2 important values:\n\n**1:** The estimated dollar value of the credit you will receive on the spread\\*\\*.\n\n**2:** The Return On Risk (or R.O.R), which is how much the credit is in relation to your TOTAL risk (max loss) of the spread.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe horizontal rows/values on the table are the SHORT leg of the spread. This means you would SELL this option (aka short leg, like your pecker).\n\nThe vertical rows/values on the table are the LONG leg of the spread. This means you would BUY this option (aka the long leg, like the shlong of the dude they told you not to worry about).\n\nThe table values that have an \"X\" mean that the spread is not valid due to the strike ranges (for calls the long strike can't be equal to or less than the short strike and vice-versa for puts).\n\n# How To Use/Example\n\nWe are going to use AAPL as an example here. AAPL's Implied Volatility is relatively low, so the premiums aren't amazing... But for the sake of the example, we see that AAPL is currently trading at $220.00. We'll look to use an expiration about a month out so we can max out on the premium we are collecting. We think it will be HIGHLY unlikely that AAPL breaks $230.00 by October 18 (considering it's already had a huge run-up).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom the tool we see it's possible to simultaneously (meaning at the same time) sell the $230.00 strike calls and buy the $232.50 calls for a CREDIT of $28.00. This means we have $28 dollars in our pockets and can go to Chipotle for lunch 3 times. Here's a breakdown of the data:\n\nMAX LOSS (spread width - premium collected) = $250 - $28 = $222\n\nMAX REWARD (the premium we collected) = $28\n\nReturn On Risk (or R.O.R) = MAX REWARD / MAX LOSS = $28 / $222 = 12.61%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, depending how CONFIDENT we are that AAPL will stay below $230 we can increase the SPREAD WIDTH by going down the $230.00 column and purchasing the call option further out. This increases the CREDIT we receive (allowing us to eat chipotle more times), but at the same time increases our MAX LOSS should the position not turn out in our favor (aka Apple sells more phones than expected).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\* I use historical options data (normally day-after data) for the scanner. So do your actual due diligence before entering a position. The tool is meant to be used as a guideline.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this tool can help some of you from THETA GANG and potentially find new recruits.
