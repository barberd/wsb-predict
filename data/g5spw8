{"id": "g5spw8", "title": "Thanks Education", "selftext": "Fellow investors. So last month I lost 56k. Then I bet $900 of my trump bucks on Goldman Sach puts last week. That play took its natural course as well. So then I thought, I\u2019m done with options unless I get magical money from some unknown source. Lo and behold, the VA education department overpaid me $1073 this past week. Mind you I haven\u2019t used the CH33 GI Bill in over a year so idk why I got this but I\u2019m just going to assume it\u2019s a mistake. If you know anything about the government overpaying you it\u2019s that they\u2019ll always get their money back. OR as the smart finance savvy individual that I am, I see it as an INTEREST FREE LOAN. Naturally it\u2019s all in on $USO Calls. They\u2019ll get their money back and I\u2019ll get my free tendies. No I\u2019m not worried about them being liquidated. No I\u2019m not worried about being wrong every single time before this. This time, this time it\u2019s different :]      TL;DR inverse everything I post.\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/ODPtyr8", "created_utc": 1587521449.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5spw8/thanks_education/", "is_self": true}
