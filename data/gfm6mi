{"id": "gfm6mi", "title": "Think Inside the $BOX [DD]", "selftext": "For all of you that spent today FOMOing into $DBX, listen up. Although they have recovered well from their COVID low, $BOX has plenty of room to run and this may finally be the chance for some of you to make a play better than just bending over for an IV crush. **TLDR: $BOX calls**\n\n#Overview\n\nEven amid all of the recent hype for $DBX, $BOX hasn't gotten the love that it deserves. Where $DBX spends most of their time making small money on the consumer front or on limited basic enterprise plans, $BOX focuses on playing with the big money (like the MMs that steal your weekly allowance). To give a bit of background, let's get into the background and then their latest 10-K.\n\n>With our Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) cloud content management platform, users can collaborate on content both internally and with external parties, automate content-driven business processes, develop custom applications, and implement data\nprotection, security and compliance features to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, internal policies and industry standards and regulations . . .  Our platform enables a broad set of business use cases across enterprises, hundreds of file formats and media types, and user experiences. Our platform integrates with leading enterprise business applications, and is compatible with multiple application environments, operating systems and devices, ensuring that workers have access to their critical business content whenever and wherever they need it.\n\nAs a common theme, you'll continue to see this enterprise focus throughout, but it gets better.\n\n>Our go-to-market strategy is focused on selling our cloud content management platform as a solution for the entire enterprise with the full set of Box capabilities, leveraging our product suite offerings, and driving high-value significant business outcomes for our customers . . .  We focus our efforts on larger enterprises, capitalizing on international growth, and utilizing our partner ecosystem, where most advantageous . . . We offer nearly 1,500 integrations with partners including Microsoft, IBM,\nSalesforce.com, Apple, Google, Slack, Adobe, Palo Alto Networks, Okta, Zoom and others, giving our users easy access to their content in Box without leaving these applications. \n\nSee some familiar names here? Those are the stocks that you've already missed the boat on. Beyond that, if you take a look at their site, you can look at some of the big names already using Box in their business: Morgan Stanley, GE, Intuit, AstraZeneca, etc. \n\nEven their CEO himself has been out trying to [tell everyone to hop on for the ride](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-24/box-ceo-aaron-levie-sees-cloud-growth-during-coronavirus), but hopefully the news coming out of the $DBX call was enough to convince you that it's viable. \n\nIf we get into their financials, you'll see strong revenue growth YoY from about $600M for the year ending 1/31/2019 to $700M on 1/31/2020. Although they have recorded a net loss each year, it's primarily driven by sales and marketing expense (45% revenue and declining YoY). When your product sells itself in this pandemic, that becomes a bit less of an issue. The balance sheet is a bit weak with limited cash and substantial A/R that may be problematic, but given the nature of their customer base and limited leverage, it shouldn't be as big of a concern.\n\nIn terms of revenue generation, I'll direct you to their [Enterprise License Agreement](https://cloud.app.box.com/s/xec0gl0gqcgverpn2rw0r4kkzqycdsme). These are 3 year agreements which include implementation and full integration into the Box platform. Over the past couple of months, even a few large organizations signing up for these are going to make it rain tendies, but I'd bet you see massive growth here. Because enterprise customers on broad platform integrations tend to be locked in for a while, it's going to lead to incredibly strong guidance.\n\n#Why now?\n\n$BOX reports earnings on 5/27, so for once you'll have the chance to get in *before* the big run up. As of now, premiums are still low and have plenty of room to run. The best part here is that because $BOX hates their accountants, their fiscal year ends on 1/31, so their quarterly earnings on 5/27 will include actual numbers through 4/30/20. Because of this, they'll have a good 2 months worth of pure COVID gains to showcase. Analysts are estimating about $0.05 EPS, but I'd bet on that being revised up and still beaten. The window may start to close as the market reacts to the $DBX earnings and detail from their conference call, but there's still time to get in tomorrow.\n\n#My Positions\n\n$BOX 6/19 17c\n\n$BOX 6/19 20c\n\nI entered started building the position earlier today and am already up about 20%, but I plan to hold over the next couple of weeks and use any dips as an opportunity to add more. As always, do your own research and mind your personal risk tolerance.", "created_utc": 1588911415.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfm6mi/think_inside_the_box_dd/", "is_self": true}
