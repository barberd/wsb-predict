They had a modest increase of 30% during yesterday\u2019s rally so we are late in this at all. The juiciest option I found is below \u2013 I wanted to take a conservative approach at this but you can be more aggressive and go for more OTM June calls. This my last DD for a while, so fuck off and enjoy the tendies until I see you next.\n\n**Position: STWD 17.5c 7/17**  \n \n\n(My long call profit calculator estimates 400% gains for this position if we see $17.5 by June 20 \u2013 which is only an increase of 17%)", "created_utc": 1590674789.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gs6w4r/stwd_a_reit_with_stellar_fundamentals_and_massive/", "is_self": true}
