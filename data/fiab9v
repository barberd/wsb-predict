AAL traded as a fucking penny stock in like 2003, and 2012, and not much higher post 2008. Fucking google it idk. The travel and hospitality industry still have much more room to fall. Also we know airlines will get bailouts. Also American Airlines doesn\u2019t hedge against fuel prices, meaning cheaper oil will lead to way bigger margins, as fuel is about 1/3 operating cost. \n\nTLDR; beers fucks airlines, Econ Don free monies, cheap zoom juice = free tendies. \n\nI added a ? After buy cause I don\u2019t think wsb is allowed to actually own anything\n\nEdit, the absolute state of retards these days. Holy fuck \u201cgay bull\u201d etc. I said it\u2019s going down. Way down. I mentioned penny stock and 2.30 price levels. How in the absolute bat soup fuck you retards think I\u2019m bullish right #now blows my tits clean off", "created_utc": 1584147448.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fiab9v/aal_long_call_buy/", "is_self": true}
