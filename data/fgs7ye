Alot of McDonald's, disney and some index fund. Im calling investment banker mike with my money tomorrow. Should i put it all into puts? I started browsing here last week and turned $500 into $400 on robinhood, and with that im convinced stonks only go down (maybe my 3/13 CCL put pays off). Should I pull out of these?
