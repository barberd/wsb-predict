There seems to be a lot of excitement made by these claims.\n\nI am not.  Here is why.  \n\n**How did they do it**?\n\nFox News Article: *\"We want to emphasize there is a cure. There is a solution that works 100\u00a0percent,\"*   \n\nSorrento Website: *\"* *These blocking antibodies were further tested for their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in an in vitro SARS-CoV-2 virus infection model pursuant to a preclinical testing agreement for COVID-19 therapeutic candidates that was previously announced on March 31, 2020.\"  \"STI-1499, demonstrated 100% inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in an in vitro\u00a0virus infection experiment at a very low antibody concentration*. \"\n\nFrom a clinical standpoint, it is misleading to suggest that there is a solution that works \"100 percent\".  The way \u201ccure\u201d is being used here, simply does not have any weight clinically.  These tests were done **in vitro**, that is to say, they were done by in cells.  This was not done in animals such as mice, and this was not tested in humans.  They claim that this was done at a \"low antibody concentration\".  The idea being suggested is that you don't need a lot of it to stop the virus from entering cells (given what it is targeting).  \n\nStrictly speaking, I have no idea what \"low antibody concentration\" means.  I have absolutely zero comparison or reference.  Does \"low\" mean \"low\" compared to the other not so great antibodies they tested?  Importantly, not addressed here is the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 being used for these experiments and how that compares to the concentrations used for other drugs in the same experiments.  In short, a lot of compounds might seem more effective and do a better job of \"inhibiting\" the virus, if there's a lot less virus around to be dealing with.  I would be far more impressed if it was stated that this was demonstrated to be effective despite increasing concentrations of virus etc.  \n\n**Judgement:**  \n\n*\"We want to emphasize there is a cure. There is a solution that works 100\u00a0percent,\"*   \n\nMy counterpoint \"A solution that works 100% under what circumstances?\".  \n\n**How did they sell it?**\n\nFox News: \n\n*Dr. Ji pointed\u00a0out that the antibody can be used as preventative therapy since there are no side effects, and that it can be more effective than any vaccine that may be developed.*\n\n*\"This is the best solution,\" he said. \"The point of making a vaccine is to generalize a neutralizing antibody. So, if you already have one, you don't need to the body to generate one from a vaccine. You've already provided it. You're cutting out the middleman.\"*\n\nWhile the comment about \"no side effects\" is not a direct quote, I am going to take this article at face value.  On the face of it, it's a true statement.  There were no side effects to \"observe\".\n\nSuch a statement has, in my opinion, next to no meaning clinically.  They are using \"humanized antibodies\" and this means that they usually take the antibodies from a non-human species and adjust them to match up more closely with the structure of antibodies humans make.  I have yet to see any FDA approved monoclonal antibody that does not have \"any side effects\" listed.  You can look up the FDA approval for any monoclonal antibody such as adalimumab, dupilumab, tocilizumab, etc.  \n\nEvery single one has many side effects, and those are often related to what is being targeted.  These medications and others are intentionally targeting proteins within our bodies, and that explains why many of them have unique side effects, as they are targeting different proteins, with different targets in our bodies.  \n\nWhile we do not have a \"spike\" protein like the *SARS-CoV-2* on our cells to interact with, and thus the likelihood of the antibodies on some other cells that look like the \"spike protein\" to have any notable effect is low, sometimes medications have side effects that could not have been predicted based on how the medication works.  For example, monitoring organ function such as liver function will likely be important in the initial studies given that the liver is often involved in the metabolism of a monoclonal antibody.  This is one of the reasons why the FDA approval is so comprehensive and lengthy.  Phase 4 clinical trials of a medication involves post-marketing surveillance (looking for side effects even after it is approved).  \n\nIn other words, just because a clear prediction for what side effects of any might occur cannot be easily made beforehand, does not mean it would be reasonable to say up front that \"there are no side effects\".  Perhaps, one of the reasons this happened is that the CEO, is a PHD, and does not have clinical experience. \n\n**Judgement:** It is extremely premature to say a medication has \"no side effects\" when it has never been tested beyond cells in a lab.  It begs the question how a comment like this could be comfortably made by a CEO.  \n\n**What's their plan?**\n\nFox News: *It was recently announced Sorrento had\u00a0partnered with New York-based health care system Mount Sinai to develop an antibody cocktail. Dubbed Covi-Shield, the cocktail will be comprised of three different antibodies and, pending FDA approval, will be used as a prophylactic treatment for people returning to work and those who have been exposed to COVID-19.*\n\n*Sorrento officials said\u00a0that STI-1499 will likely be the first antibody in the cocktail. They are also looking to develop the antibody as a stand-alone therapy due to its high potency, according to a statement provided to Fox News.*\n\n*\"This is the best solution,\" he said. \"The point of making a vaccine is to generalize a neutralizing antibody. So, if you already have one, you don't need to the body to generate one from a vaccine. You've already provided it. You're cutting out the middleman.\"* \n\nThis is not at all practical to suggest using **three monoclonal antibodies**, all that the same time from a preventative standpoint.  Why is this an issue?  Well unlike other medications that are taken on a daily basis, these monoclonal antibodies tend to stay in your system for a varied period of time depending on how they are metabolized.  Practically speaking, if they actually planned to administer them as a \"cocktail\" in one injection (only way this would make sense as a preventative), ideally you would want for all of those medications to last in your body for roughly the same period of time, so that they can be dosed at the same interval (all three medications every 3 months, or every 2 weeks etc).   There are a number relevant pharmacokinetic reasons why this would be silly as well.  From a manufacturing/cost standpoint, it's a surprising claim.  Put simply, monoclonal antibodies aren't cheap.  Depending on how long the antibodies stayed active, a repeat injection would likely be needed.  \n\nThere are a number of reasons why a vaccine would be better than a monoclonal antibody.  Vaccines will induce fully human antibodies, and not \"humanized\" antibodies and therefore, in my opinion, the risks or side effects associated with \"humanized\" antibodies versus \"human\" antibodies would not be an issue.  Depending on how the vaccine is designed, it may do more than just induce antibodies, but also recruit other parts of the immune system such as the \"cellular immune response\" and not just a \"humoral immune response\".  In looking at how to defeat any virus, a cellular immune response is in many ways, just as important in my opinion, and sometimes more important depending on the virus and the vaccine design.  One of the beautiful things about our immune system is that it can \"ramp up\" an immune response depending on how much virus is present, and this would not really be possible to do with a monoclonal antibody approach.  One exception, might be, if used therapeutically in a hospital in continuing to provide this to the patient as has been done with tocilizumab etc.  I want to be very clear that this is NOT the same thing as the immune system being \"too active\" such as in the case of the so-called \"cytokine storm\".  In the case of the cytokine storm, the virus is essentially **dysregulating** the immune system to act in this way we wouldn't want them to.  A vaccine, a \"preventative\", or a therapeutic given very early could limit the ability of the virus to replicate and impact the immune system in this way.  In other words, you'd be stopping the virus near the entryway, instead of trying to come in after it has ravaged every floor of your house.  A potential downside to a vaccine is that it does take time for your body to build-up a sufficient immune response, usually one month or more.\n\n**Judgement:** From a preventative standpoint, I would posit that a vaccine has far better risk/benefit profile compared to a the monoclonal antibody approach targeting the virus such as the one reported by Sorrento.  My response here is solely referring to the \"preventative\".  I am NOT saying that monoclonal antibodies are not effective, or would not be effective from a therapeutic standpoint.  I think there is promise/merit in trying to stop/correct the immune system dysregulation that the virus is causing, and these types of antibodies are wholly different from the one(s) being put forth by Sorrento.\n\n**TLDR:** \n\n\\- It is clinically meaningless to say you achieved a \"cure\" in lab cells\".\n\n\\- I am skeptical of anything being \"100 percent effective\" without the conditions being stated.\n\n\\- A medication does not have any side effects until they do, that's why monitoring for side effects is important.  We don't know that we don't know.  \n\n\\- Three monoclonal antibodies at once is not practical or cost effective.  The safety profile/pharmacokinetics of each one would need to be evaluated/verified, and then likely the same thing would have to be done when all of them are given together (unless they just skipped straight to the trio, which I doubt will happen).  \n\n\\- **A well-designed vaccine** (both strong humoral and cellular immune responses) would be much better than a monoclonal antibody from a preventative standpoint.  \n\n\\- Please do not confuse a strong immune response from a vaccine as being similar or related to the dysregulated immune response from the cytokine storm that is caused by the virus.  \n\n**Disclaimer:** My post is not intended here as investing advice or investment advice.
