Crowded af, bunch of pissed off tards like me. \n\nWait 20 mins, throw slacks on desk, complete return. Old lady cashier gives me 25% Off Kohl's coupon. See air fryer I want on the way out, wait another 20 mins in checkout line, buy that shit instead.\n\nNow I have no pants that'll fit my stupid fat ass bc I returned them in favor of irl tendies \ud83c\udf57\n\nFuck $AMZN... $KSS to the moon", "created_utc": 1564066859, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/chotz6/amzn_screwed_up_my_prime_day_order_kss_surprise/", "is_self": true}
