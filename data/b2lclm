{"id": "b2lclm", "title": "1-800-PetMed-Express ($PETS) DD", "selftext": "Eight months ago I posted some flakey DD to buy pre-earnings puts on $PETS (based primarily on the fact that they were overvalued at the time and their website is ugly), which panned out pretty well for those who participated: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/90gwsa/puts\\_on\\_pets/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/90gwsa/puts_on_pets/) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that earnings report, and the 50% drop since then, I actually started digging in to the company and went long shares based on the following:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPros:\n\n* $93mil cash on hand (\\~$4.50 per share, or more than 20% of market cap)\n* Zero debt (current ratio &gt; 5)\n* P/E Ratio of 10\n* Dividend of &gt;5% (and growing), less than 50% of cashflow\n* Steady revenue and earnings growth\n* Investors have been increasingly putting pressure on the company to return some of that cash to shareholders\n* People love their pets, and they tend to do whatever they can to continue buying their medication\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCons:\n\n* CEO is a bit of a slouch, comes across as having a poor attitude and hardly answers questions\n* Advertising and customer acquisition spend has been steadily increasing\n* Repurchase orders have been mostly flat\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThoughts? Why isn\u2019t this a no-brainer?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclosure: I own several hundred shares and some leaps, will be buying more.
