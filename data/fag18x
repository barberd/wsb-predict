Long dated calls or just outright stock.  \n\n\nReasons:\n\n1. Cloud adoption of AMD Epyc CPU's is on the rise with both Google and NOAA announcing they will be using AMD over Intel as it provides them with a lower cost to server and higher performance for their workloads. \\[[source](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-supercomputers-heading-to-noaa-will-predict-weather-with-327680-zen-2-cores)\\]\\[[source](https://hothardware.com/news/amd-epyc-zen-2-sever-adoption-expands-at-google-cloud)\\]\n2. AMD is seen as a market leader for tasks aimed at 3D rendering and animation. AMD Threadripper CPUs perform up to 90% faster when compare to the competition. \\[[source](https://architosh.com/2020/01/blur-and-amd-gen-3-ryzen-threadripper-save-day-on-terminator-dark-fate/)\\]\n3.

Any assumptions that Intel will be able to catch up are wrong simply because even if Intel does release faster chips, so will AMD. \\[It was hard to find 1 source on this\\]\n7. Fears from the WuFlu on production constraints are unlikely to provide any competitive advantage to Intel or Nvidia as they too will be similarly affected. More importantly, the reason AMD is winning is because they have a better product at a lower price point and this will remain true as a price war with Intel or NVDIA is bad for everyone involved. \n8. Price targets for $AMD currently range between $60-65. It was the best performing stock on the S&amp;P 500 for 2019 and even during the market correction in 2018, it was able to provide consistent returns. \\[[source](https://www.benzinga.com/top-stories/19/12/15035037/10-best-performing-s-p-500-stocks-of-2019)\\]\n\nPositions: I currently have 20 03/20 and 4/3 AMD 60C and 65C.
