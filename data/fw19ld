I know these positions are hella pussy but I've been getting wiped by IV lately so decided to go for a longer timeframe on my options for now until the waves settle.\n\nDD:   \n\n\n**JWN**\n\nNordstrom is actually seeing earnings growth and they're trading at a P/E of 4.79 according to Google (that means without earnings growth, they will double their balance sheet in 4.8 years): [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/jwn/financials](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/jwn/financials)\n\nDisclosure: I have 300 shares and 6 Jan 22 $20 calls\n\n**DENN**:   \nThey're trading at a P/E of 4.1. They've released a statement that they've secured additional capital to withstand covid closures, and been upgraded by at least two analysts in the past two weeks.\n\nDisclosure: I have 475 DENN shares and 10 Nov 20 $12.5 calls  \n\n\nI know this is pretty weak DD, but I too have trigger happy diamond hands.
