For those that have short-term calls, sorry for your lost tendies. For those that are holding past March, stay strong -- tendies will be crispy. \n\nHere's my rational from past ER:\n\n* Microsoft's commercial cloud growth up 39% \n* Office 365 commercial rev growth up 27%\n* Windows OEM revenue up 18%. \n* MSFT Divided date: 02/19/20\n\nThey are diversified and vaccinated from the gay-ass coronavirus with strong passive inflow from Nasdaq 100, SPY and over 277 ETFs have MSFT in their top 15 holdings.\n\nToday, [Evercore ISI](https://www.barrons.com/articles/microsoft-stock-can-keep-rising-for-5-reasons-analyst-says-51581617083?siteid=yhoof2&amp;yptr=yahoo) **raised PT to $212** from $190. I expect Heather Bellini, analyst at Goldman Sachs, to raise PT for Microsoft very soon. Here's [her take on FastMoney yesterday](https://youtu.be/YxhlZ0EQANU?t=72) stating she's not only bullish short-term, but long-term as well.
