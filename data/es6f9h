But I think I discovered an even better full proof plan that I haven\u2019t tested yet, but in theory this plan should fully work. \n\nI was looking at all the different brokers after robinhood suspended my account because I was trying to get everyone to abuse the iron condor glitch,[Article about iron condor glitch](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/new-robinhood-infinite-leverage-free-glitch-found-reddit-trader-claims-2019-12-1028730335) and it turns out TD Ameritrade lets you use Apple Pay to fund your account. I thought Robinhood was the only idiotic broker but I guess their all stupid. \n\nSo anyways Apple just decided to let anyone get a guaranteed credit card if you sign up for the Apple Card, and they let you use the card immediately in Apple Pay after signing up for an account. So this means we can all just open Apple Credit Cards, fund our TD Ameritrade with our Apple Card in Apple Pay with as much money as we can, then buy unlimited TSLA $690 calls. If we lose all of our money and can\u2019t pay Apple back, we just have to say, \u201cI DECLARE BANKRUPTCY!\u201d Then we\u2019ll be fine and won\u2019t get in any trouble with the SEC. It\u2019ll be TD Ameritrade\u2019s, and Apple\u2019s fault for creating a faulty system that lets us do this, so we\u2019re pretty much off scot free.\n\nIf we play the market right with this unlimited amount of loan money from Apple Pay, we can seriously make so many tendies from TSLA $690 calls that we can actually just buy the city of Detroit to create a massive Wallstreetbets empire, instead of having a few buildings for a small Wallstreetbets corporation.\n\n#I literally cannot see how this can go tits up", "created_utc": 1579665169, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/es6f9h/unlimited_money_with_apple_card_and_td_ameritrade/", "is_self": true}
