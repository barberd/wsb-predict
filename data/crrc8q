Last quarter they missed the EPS consensus by $0.02.\n\nInvestors are staying away from most Chinese companies given the current geopolitical state. Plus, if a recession is coming, it will surely hit Asia and Europe first. Investors are moving their money back into U.S. companies, where they know they can ride the bull for at least another 16 months, or after the presidential election.\n\nIf you think Google is bad at censoring.
