I\u2019m looking to do some long term calls so I can double my initial investment and buy a gaming pc. \n\nThanks so much for any advice or help :-)\n\nEDIT: the first and only stock I bought was 100 shares of Nokia at $3.45. Also, when I say buy a pc I mean buying pc parts so I can build my own. \n\nAlso I can\u2019t tell if the htz stuff is a troll or not I read some posts of people making fun of the people that did invest when the company was begging them not to lol.", "created_utc": 1592522202.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbpauu/starting_my_stock_market_journey/", "is_self": true}
