We\u2019re entering a period of stagflation, impulsively increasing our national debt by 10%, and we\u2019re printing worthless cash as if there is no tomorrow.\n\nSo, let\u2019s talk about something that is actually valuable: gold. Gold has barely gone up during our 12 year ~~bull run~~ bubble, and it\u2019s ready to surge. Time to buy some gold coins, right? Wrong. Sure, using physical gold might get you to the front of the line for a little while once the trusty old benjamin starts to take a dive, but let\u2019s be honest, the government is probably going to regulate physical gold like they\u2019ve done in past recessions anyway.\n\nThe solution? Gold futures. Actually, gold *mining* futures. $JNUG is a great way to bet on gold miners. Sure, mines are closing down all over the world, but that will only up demand for gold, and spikes in $XAUUSD hype up $GDXJ, a gold mining ETF. When $GDXJ, gets bought up, the gates are released for the $JNUG bulls to drive prices to numbers that won\u2019t even fit on your screen.\n\nIt has been super oversold because of all the bagholders buying up $JDST, the inverse of $JNUG, in hopes that the market has reached its bottom (wrong) and news of mines shutting down (which is actually good news, because gold demand will skyrocket further). In fact, $JNUG was just recently comfortably trading at $70 to $80 or so a share, and has now dropped below $5. Will it continue to drop? No. And that\u2019s because my research has confirmed that $JDST, its inverse, will continue to drop instead, especially as last week\u2019s hype will sell off this coming Monday PM and people\u2019s attention will once again be on $JNUG. When people see that the market is red, there is even more incentive for them to get in on the bargain. Inflation in the dollar will keep the surge strong. It will be like a blast of cold air, once we feel the economic effects of the stimulus bill, because I think we can all agree that blowing the bubble bigger is not a viable solution.\n\nThat\u2019s all for today kids, be bear or be square. You heard it here first!\n\nTL;DR: Gold good, fiat currency bad, dollar crash soon, gold mining make gold, decrease in dollar buying power and gold production means increase in gold value, play gold mining futures for easy tendies", "created_utc": 1585529317.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frh1h8/gold_mining_futures_will_spike_the_dollar_will/", "is_self": true}
