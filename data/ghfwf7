{"id": "ghfwf7", "title": "Distribution Days Due Diligence RIP Bears", "selftext": "Ok so I couldn't find anywhere to easily look up distribution days and I'm new to investing so take this all with a grain of salt. But here is a spreadsheet I made on distribution days on the NASDAQ and S&P 500. This is based on volume and a drop of market price by 0.2% or more.\n\nWhat I find interesting most on this analysis how there hasn't been a single distribution day since April 28th and how there was about 50% distribution days on both markets just before the major downturn around March 9th. Anyways if anyone has any more feedback about this analysis or info they would like to share about distribution days I would welcome that conversation.\n\nFor clarification this is analysis on the NASDAQ with just the DD results of YES on the right for if it was a distribution day for S&P 500.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hei3lwh522y41.jpg?width=1494&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=599cde34cf9969f450459f4ec7d0e636d9983d4f", "created_utc": 1589167733.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghfwf7/distribution_days_due_diligence_rip_bears/", "is_self": true}
