Many of the bears are upset about Friday after Lil Yachty's album drop did not bring the apocalypse, but I am here to tell you the Lil Yachty Rug Pull (LYRP) is quickly approaching.\n\nLet's take a trip back in history to see how previous LYRPs played out:\n\n* On **March 9, 2018**, Lil Yachty released one of the most acclaimed productions of our lives, Lil Boat 2. On that day, SPY gained 1.65%. But then over the following two weeks it dropped over 8%.\n* On **August 23, 2018**, Lil Yachty released a fan favorite, Nuthin' 2 Prove. The market continued to trade sideways/up.. but he was just priming that dump for his next album, released on October 19, 2018. After its release, the market dropped 16% over the next two months before reversing on December 26, 2018.\n* After making such market-moving albums, Lil Yachty took a break in his Little Yacht. He let the markets re-gain their footings. Waiting. Lurking. Sleeping in the Goldman Sachs janitorial closet accumulating puts.\n* On **February 28, 2020**, Lil Yachty blessed the bears with the release of another life changing album, A-Team. On that day, SPY gained 2.77%. Bears were in shambles. But a few days later, on March 5th, the downward spiral began, finally bottoming out and reversing on March 24th, for an approximate 30% drop.\n\nNow our prophet has been priming that dump once again, waiting to deal the final death blow. He released Lil Boat 3, the third in this Epic Trilogy of Market Destruction, on **May 29, 2020**. SPY gained 0.61%, in preparation of the LYRP to be unleashed over the next two weeks.\n\nBrace, my friends, it's all down hill from here. The LYRP is upon us.\n\n**TL;DR:** Brace for impact as this boat is getting ready to sink like no other.
