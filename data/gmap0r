These data will span the company's investigational and approved oncology portfolio medicines\u00a0across chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), multiple myeloma (MM), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and myelofibrosis (MF).\n\"We continue to demonstrate the broad utility of our oncology portfolio \u2013 anchored by VENCLEXTA/VENCLYXTO and IMBRUVICA \u2013 with new, longer-term and clinically meaningful results presented at this year's EHA meeting,\" said  Neil Gallagher , M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer and vice president of development, AbbVie. \"We are excited to share these studies with the global oncology community as they reflect our ongoing commitment to improving care for patients with various difficult-to-treat blood cancers.\"\n\n\n\nFrom that, I think the two biggest catalysts will be Risankizumab and Upadacitinib - both of them being mostly in the submitted stage. Once they get approved I think this stock will skyrocket. Prior to these two drugs they didn't really have any major weapons against dermatologic conditions such as atopic dermatitis (aka eczema) or psoriasis. The company that pretty much has market dominance with those conditions is Sanofi Genzyme/Regeneron with their Dupixent. I have a really good outlook for ABBV.\n\n\nALSO\n\nThey bought mothafuckin Allegran! Allergan has so many products it's insane - with their most popular one being botox. No new or old neuromodulator (product that inactivates muscles - what botox is) can compete with botox's market dominance. There are other neuromodulator brands that are much better than botox and last longer, like Dysport, but people prefer Botox since it's like a household name. Allergan alone makes billions from their lineup. ABBV got them at a steal when they purchased them at $63 billion. \n\nAbbVie stock is one of the most highly traded pharmaceutical companies. In terms of average daily volume, AbbVie stock ranks first in its industry group.\nAnalysts acknowledge the deal with Allegran helps AbbVie diversify away from Humira. In the first quarter AbbVie topped Wall Street's earnings expectations and sales. \n\n\n\n-PROFESSIONAL OPINIONS\n\n\u201cHere at Zacks, our focus is on the proven Zacks Rank system, which emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find great stocks. Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.\n\nLooking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.\n\nZacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the \"Value\" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, \"A\" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.\n\nABBV is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 8.50 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 16.10. Over the past year, ABBV's Forward P/E has been as high as 10.29 and as low as 5.96, with a median of 8.26.\n\nValue investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. ABBV has a P/S ratio of 3.93. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 4.18.\n\nFinally, our model also underscores that ABBV has a P/CF ratio of 12.77. This figure highlights a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook\u201d\n\n\nKey words: UNDERVALUED, BUY RANKING OF A, IMPRESSIVE CASH OUTLOOK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMotley Fool-\n\n\u201cAbbVie: A de-risked growth and income play\n\n\nAbbVie is a large-cap biopharma company. The company's shares are worth checking out this month for two core reasons. First and foremost, AbbVie is slated to close on its $63 billion acquisition of Allergan before the end of May. This mega-merger will greatly diversify AbbVie's product portfolio, lowering the risk associated with the eventual decline of the company's anti-inflammatory medicine, Humira.  \n\nSecondly, AbbVie's brand-new immunology medicines Skyrizi and Rinvoq, and its blood cancer franchise consisting of Imbruvica and Venclexta, are all exceeding expectations at the moment. These four key products, in fact, helped AbbVie to handily beat Wall Street's first-quarter revenue estimate earlier this month. \n\nAbbVie's shares have yet to truly benefit from these positive tailwinds, though. As proof, the company's stock is presently trading at less than nine times forward-looking earnings. That's a dirt-cheap valuation for a blue-chip biopharma stock, especially for one that pays a sky-high annualized yield of 5.53% at current levels.\u201d\n\nKey-words: HAVNT BENEFITED FROM PURCHASE OF ALLEGRAN YET, DIRT-CHEAP, PURCHASED A 63 BILLION DOLLAR CASH COW COMPANY THAT RAKES IN BILLIONS OF DOLLARS\n\n\n\nTHE MOVE\n\n\nSo here\u2019s the move boys, 6/19 calls with a $115-130 Strikes. I personally like the $120, but that\u2019s cause I like the number 12. They are going for .03-.04 per call, and load up on them. We have 5 weeks for the stock to go up after purchasing a 63 BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY. Spy puts may of worked for loss porn, but this is the real tendie machine boys.
