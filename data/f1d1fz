Bunch of new idiots rushing into the stock market playing risky options (and doing better than most money managers). Valuations at highest levels in decades. Inflation picking up. End of the loosening cycle. People are euphoric and every bear has been taken out into he street and shot by the Robinhood Margin Call Department. I bought QQQ April puts for $160-190 strikes. I think this mirrors the setups from 1929 and 1987 and there will be a 10-30% drawdown in the next few months. Just my $0.02. \n\nAnd not to pick on any particular newbie, but look at this post\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f1a7sy/msft/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f1a7sy/msft/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)\n\nand specifically the top comments: \u201cSounds like free money.\u201d \u201cThis\u201d etc. \n\nThis is happening hundreds of times a day with stocks that have decades high multiple and parabolic charts. Every chain's top 5 comment is \"stocks only go up\". People who wrote calls are literally on suicide watch by WSB. This is euphoria. \n\nIf I am wrong, I can always take a loss and sell since I have a few months of time value.", "created_utc": 1581274219, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f1d1fz/i_think_we_topped_and_bought_qqq_april_puts/", "is_self": true}
