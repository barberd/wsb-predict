This exchange used to be known as the Chicago Butter and Egg Board known for trading futures on broiler chickens.  In the elevator there is a button for a floor nobody can get to.  No members have access to this floor and only security can open the elevator door to this floor above the trading floors with access to the vip visitors gallery.  On this floor there is a room and in this room there is a chicken.  This chicken is made of gold and is about four feet high.  This golden chicken statue in the vip reception hall of the old mercantile exchange building is actually the one-true-God of wsb.", "created_utc": 1588135629.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ga31ah/fd_commodity_options_illegal_recommendations/", "is_self": true}
