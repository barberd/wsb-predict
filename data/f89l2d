But if you don\u2019t have control of your own mind and control of the psychological part of this you\u2019re dead in the water. So many people take such large positions and get smoked and have no way of getting out. People I see buy options and don\u2019t even do any DD it\u2019s more of gambling for them. Point of the post I\u2019m making is stop looking up trading techniques and look up emotional intelligence and psychology and begin to check yourself and the gains will roll in!!!", "created_utc": 1582465343, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f89l2d/trading_and_what_ive_learned/", "is_self": true}
