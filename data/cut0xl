Trump is expected to discuss the U.S. economy and highlight the U.S. pro-jobs, pro-growth agenda, under his leadership.\n*****\n&gt; The U.S. trade war with China escalated sharply in the past week, with a new round of tariffs from China on U.S. goods announced Friday and new threats from Trump, who \u201cordered\u201d American companies to find alternatives to China. That immediately triggered speculation that the trade war will be extended and more contentious, and the U.S. economy risks falling into recession.\n*****\n&gt; After the close Friday, Trump retaliated against China\u2019s tariffs by raising existing tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese goods to 30% from 25%, as of Oct. 1. In a tweet, he also said he was raising new tariffs on $300 billion in Chinese goods that have not yet gone into effect to 15% from 10%.\n*****\n&gt; Friday\u2019s trading was volatile, and stocks fell by about 2.5%, erasing what would have been a second positive week for the market. Treasury yields, which move opposite price, continued to go lower amid worries about the economy and fears the Fed will not act aggressively enough to head off a recession.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks have been volatile, and the S&amp;P 500 is down about 4.5% in the month of August.\n*****\n&gt; Michael Arone, State Street Advisors chief investment strategist said the first seven months of the year were more certain for investors in terms of their expectations for Fed rate cuts and a possible trade deal. But the trade tensions have worsened, and the trade war could escalate even further.\n*****\n&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell spoke at Jackson Hole Friday morning, but while he left the door open for rate cuts, he did not explicitly promise rate cuts.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed has become a lot less certain. Until we get more clarity, you\u2019re likely to see this volatility, and stocks will trade sideways,\u201d Arone said. Even though corporate earnings weakened, \u201cinvestors took a big leap of faith in the first seven months of the year, expecting both a trade deal and monetary policy easing.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The escalation of the trade war makes a deal unlikely anytime soon. This, however, did drive market expectations for rate cuts higher Friday afternoon, and the market was expecting three more cuts this year.\n*****\n&gt; Trump tied his feuds with China and the Fed together Friday, when he tweeted that the Fed is not helping with easier rate policy, along with a question about \u201cwho is the bigger enemy\u201d \u2014 China President Xi Jinping or Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the Fed is in uncharted territory, and I continue to have empathy for Chairman Powell. I think markets want faster and more aggressive policy. He\u2019s dealing with challenges the Fed has never had,\u201d said Arone.\n*****\n&gt; \u201d[Powell] is literally walking a tight rope. He has the president who is daily bashing him,\u201d he said. \u201cBond markets are demanding a much greater number of rate cuts, and he\u2019s got geopolitical challenges, whether it\u2019s Brexit or trade. He\u2019s also got dissension among Fed voting members. That\u2019s a lot to balance.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; There is some important data in the coming week, including durable goods Monday and personal spending and consumption data Friday, which also includes the PCE deflator, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation indicator.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe data will give us some indications on business spending. Durable goods has capital expenditure orders. It looks look consumer confidence will come out [Tuesday] as well,\u201d Arone said. Business spending has been taking a hit from the trade wars, and economists are concerned it will continue to weaken, ultimately leading to weakness in the consumer economy.\n*****\n&gt; The week ahead could see some swings ahead of the long Labor Day Holiday weekend. \u201cGiven high absentees and low volumes, my guess is it\u2019s going to add to volatility,\u201d said Arone.\n*****\n&gt; Frank Cappelleri, Nomura executive director, said he also expects volatility, and the S&amp;P could test the outer limits of its recent range.\n*****\n&gt; Of the 17 trading days this month, nine of them saw absolute 1% moves in the S&amp;P 500. The last time that occurred was in December, when there were 10 days with 1% moves, according to Cappelleri. The most in one month was February, 2018 when there were 12. Contrast that to the entire year of 2017, when there were just eight.\n*****\n&gt; Friday\u2019s action was volatile, and the S&amp;P 500 was down as much as 3%.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThis is the third-biggest decline we\u2019ve had this month. Each of them started within 10 points of each other, near the top of the range,\u201d said Cappelleri. The top of the range is 2,943, its Aug. 13 high, and the bottom is 2,820, near the Aug. 5 low.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re obviously still in a trading range that has been characterized by sharp moves and acute turns, so I think when we had that initial drop on Aug. 5, the question is where is it going to stop,\u201d he said, adding traders are watching that Aug. 5 level to see if it will act as a floor.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/xq30jTG.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/7EMo1n2.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/sitpCf2.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/GuC2iQw.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/QnCZRQc.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/o3IuWrT.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/g1eXOKI.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Jo1DyQM.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/REAFEsy.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n*(NONE SCHEDULED FOR THIS WEEK.)*\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/kHuJjV8.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/4TzXRQR.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Second Half August Trading: Historically Weak Too\n\n&gt; Following three straight days of gains, the market has recovered a sizable portion of its losses from earlier in the month. Losses earlier in the month and gains over the past three days (prior to today) have tracked August\u2019s typical trading pattern for over the last 21-years quite closely. The magnitude of the moves this year has been larger than average, but the pattern has been tracked.\n\nDue to the magnitude of this year\u2019s moves, August\u2019s performance over the past 21-years has been plotted on the left vertical axis in the chart above and 2019 is plotted on the right. From right around mid-month or now through the end of August, the historical trend has been weaker. DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and 2000 have all averaged a loss in August from 1998 to 2018 and they are on track to repeat this year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/01a116327b794dfbbf5f60981adf7ef1/f81503f55cdacc93-55/s500x750/41c284d8350eac55b6e9a2b768b07a84cbed9936.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Is a Small-Cap Labor Day Rally Coming Soon\n\n&gt; In the below chart, forty years of daily data for the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies are divided by the Russell 1000 index of largest companies, and then compressed into a single year to show an idealized yearly pattern. When the graph is descending, large-cap companies are outperforming small-cap companies; when the graph is rising, smaller companies are moving up faster than their larger brethren. The most prominent period of outperformance generally begins in mid-December and lasts until late-February or early March with a surge in January. This period of outperformance by small-caps is known as the \u201cJanuary Effect\u201d in the annual Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7e6c3b63cadd687e835cca014192dd72/fcd39e87be04620c-93/s500x750/7e0c19f7fee940a61f9ece5a88f65d53900365f3.jpg))**\n\n&gt; In recent years, another sizable move is quite evident just before Labor Day. One possible explanation for this move is individual investors begin to return to work after summertime vacations and are searching for \u201cbargain\u201d stocks. In a typical year, small-caps would have been lagging and could represent an opportunity relative to other large-cap possibilities. As of Friday\u2019s close (August 16, 2019), Russell 2000 is up 10.8% compared to the Russell 1000 being up 15.5% year-to-date. Lagging small-caps and resilient U.S. consumers could be the ideal setup for a repeat of this pattern this year. However, the small-cap advantage does historically wane around mid-September.\n\n*****\n\n# September Almanac: No Respite in Pre-Election Years\n\n&gt; The start of business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Sizable gains in September 2012, 2013 and 2017 have lifted Russell 2000 to second worst (since 1979). September was creamed four years straight from 1999-2002 after four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble madness. September gets no respite from positive pre-election year forces.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/5e73bc3f171da163b1e601cc26081c21/773b35094e2a77db-2e/s400x600/50353a79845a11b2bdb490f6a5ae95d25a672388.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Although the month used to open strong, S&amp;P 500 has declined eight times in the last eleven years on the first trading day. As tans begin to fade and the new school year begins, fund managers tend to sell underperforming positions as the end of the third quarter approaches, causing some nasty selloffs near month-end over the years. Recent substantial declines occurred following the terrorist attacks in 2001 (DJIA: \u201311.1%), 2002 (DJIA \u201312.4%), the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 (DJIA: \u20136.0%) and U.S. debt ceiling debacle in 2011 (DJIA \u20136.0%). However, September is improving with S&amp;P 500 advancing in ten of the last 15 Septembers and DJIA climbing in nine.\n\n*****\n\n# Leading Indicators Signal Growth Ahead\n\n&gt; U.S. leading indicators rebounded in July, a good sign for the durability of the expansion.\n\n&gt; The Conference Board\u2019s Leading Economic Index (LEI) rose 0.5% month over month, the biggest gain since September 2018, and above consensus expectations for a 0.3% increase. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Leading Indicators Slowing But Growing, the LEI climbed 1.6% year over year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DUqIDwl.jpg))**\n\n&gt; The LEI, which we include as one of the \u201cFive Forecasters\u201d of our Recession Watch Dashboard, has yet to turn negative this cycle. The index has fallen negative year over year before all nine recessions since 1955.\n\n&gt; \u201cSome investors have pointed out slowing LEI growth as a reason for caution,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cHowever, the LEI is signaling moderate U.S. economic growth ahead, with no signs of an imminent recession.\u201d\n\n&gt; The LEI is calculated from 10 individual leading data sets, including weekly jobless claims, building permits, and stock prices. This year, the majority of LEI components have boosted month-over-month growth in the index, but more internationally exposed data sets have turned into net drags.\n\n&gt; In July, 6 of 10 components rose month over month, but four components\u2014average hours worked, manufacturers\u2019 new orders, new orders for nondefense capital spending, and interest rate spreads\u2014fell month over month. Historically, breadth in LEI components has deteriorated further before a recession began. In contrast, at the end of each of the past six economic cycles, more than half of the LEI components were in decline.\n\n&gt; While evidence of slowing growth in leading indicators is disappointing, we are encouraged by what we see outside of manufacturing. Global manufacturing has been the sector hardest hit by prolonged trade tensions and weakened demand, and we don\u2019t expect to see much improvement until a U.S.-China trade resolution is reached. Even then, a recovery in manufacturing may take some time.\n\n*****\n\n# Complexity Behind the Fed Rate Cut\n\n&gt; Minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) July meeting, released August 21, show the complexity of policymakers\u2019 discussions leading up to the first rate cut of this economic cycle.\n\n&gt; Policymakers debated what to do amid strong consumer spending, a solid labor market, tepid inflation, sluggish business investment, financial stability, global risks, and the persistent headwind of trade uncertainty. Ultimately, the Fed announced a 25 basis point (0.25%) rate reduction after a vote with two dissents (Fed presidents Esther George from Kansas City and Eric Rosengren from Boston).\n\n&gt; The minutes also reinforced Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s description of the rate cut as a \u201cmid-cycle adjustment,\u201d a characterization that was especially evident from upbeat economic commentary. These rate changes, which we\u2019ve referred to as \u201ccourse corrections,\u201d have been a feature of many economic cycles and have been more of a risk management tool in response to building risks than a response to an impending recession.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe Fed recognized the growing need for looser policy as insurance against heightened global uncertainty,\u201d said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cLower rates could provide a buffer if uncertainty materially weighs on growth, reducing the chances of a policy mistake or a rush to cut rates before a recession.\u201d\n\n&gt; Participants generally agreed that the U.S. economic outlook was solid, even though inflation had slipped a little this year. In fact, domestic economic strength was the driving force behind the two dissents. George voted against a rate cut because there were few signs of weakness in incoming data or the medium-term economic outlook. Rosengren dissented because he saw no \u201cclear and compelling case\u201d for rate cuts, especially given his concerns for financial stability.\n\n&gt; The minutes, however, gave few clues on the future path of policy, and participants emphasized the importance of maintaining \u201coptionality\u201d with policy and basing rate decisions on incoming information.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Investors Expect More Rate Cuts Ahead, investors are positioning for multiple 25 basis point rate cuts through the end of 2019.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PPwxsaE.png))**\n\n&gt; We agree that one or two more 25 basis point \u201cinsurance\u201d rate cuts could be ahead as the Fed attempts to ease pressure on the Treasury yield curve and global currencies.\n\n*****\n\n# Crude Oil's Descending Triangle\n\n&gt; Earlier this week, crude oil was trading well over 2% higher than last Friday's close. Over the past few sessions, though, oil has given up all of those gains. The catalyst for today's declines are the Chinese retaliatory tariffs on US crude which are expected to dampen demand. This week's negative reversal comes as the commodity ran into multiple points of resistance. For starters, the rally began to stall out mid-week when it met the converging 200 and 50-day moving averages. This also coincided with a downtrend that traces itself all the way back to the highs from late last year. In fact, crude is down around 30% from these previous highs.\n\n&gt; Overall, the technical picture for crude oil is not in a great place as the chart is forming a descending triangle pattern. Despite the big gains at the beginning of 2019, over the past few months, crude has been making consistent lower highs and lower lows. Given this most recent failure to retake the moving averages and break out of the downtrend, the next major support level to watch is around $50 which is a level that has held up at multiple times in the past few months. This support also draws back to late last year prior to the collapse in December.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/082319-CL2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yield Curves: Another Record Streak Bites the Dust\n\n&gt; After the 3-month vs 10-year US Treasury yield curve first inverted earlier this year, the market has shifted its focus to the 2-year vs 10-year part of the curve which had yet to reach inverted levels. That was, until yesterday. While the 10s2s curve flirted with inverted territory for the last few days on an intraday basis, Thursday was the first time in more than a decade that the closing yield on the two-year US Treasury was above the yield on the 10-year. And with another closely watched part of the curve moving into inverted levels, recession fears increased.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/082319-10s2s-YC-Long-Terms.png))**\n\n&gt; As the chart above illustrates, it has been a while since the 10s2s curve was inverted. In fact, the streak that just ended was the longest on record going back to 1977, and it wasn't even close. Going back to 1977, there have only been three prior streaks where the 10s2s curve was inverted for more than 1,000 days, and never before had the curve been positively sloped for more than 2,000 days. The current streak, though? 3,054 days. It was fun while it lasted!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/082319-10s2s-YC-Streaks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Adapt or Die\n\n&gt; A common characteristic of most investors and traders is to always be on the lookout for patterns and connections between various asset classes. Whenever one correlated asset confirms the move in another it adds a layer of confidence to an investor's thesis. One long-held example is the Dow Transports as a leading or coincident indicator for the broader market. For decades now, many investors have followed the transports for confirmation of the broader market moves. If the transports \u2014 which move all of the physical goods in the economy \u2014 rally, it suggests that the broader market will be strong, while periods when the transports start to roll over are read as a signal that there's an underlying weakness in the economy.\n\n&gt; As the US economy has become more service and digital-oriented in nature, there has been a valid argument made that the transports have lost some of their importance as an indicator of the broader economy. Along these lines, we have suggested that rather than transports, semiconductors may represent this century's 'transports' as they are a part of just about everything in this digital age. Whether you agree with this or not isn't important, but the important takeaway is that just because two asset classes have been highly correlated in the past doesn't mean that they will remain that way in the future. It's one thing to recognize a correlation between two asset classes, but it's much more important to understand why they are correlated and be on the lookout for factors that may change the status quo in the future.\n\n&gt; One example of a radical change in a relationship between two asset classes is the interaction between the relative strength of growth and value stocks versus the slope of the yield curve. From 2002 through 2011, the two were closely correlated. As the curve flattened in the early part of this century, growth stocks underperformed value by a wide margin (falling blue line). Then in mid-2007, as the curve steepened and came out from inverted territory, growth stocks started to rip higher relative to value. Beginning in 2009, though, the curve stopped steepening and the relative strength of growth relative to value stalled out. The two series were so closely joined at the hip during this ten-year stretch that the correlation coefficient between the two was +0.82, which is indicative of two series moving in lockstep with each other.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/082219-YC-GV-2002-2019.png))**\n\n&gt; If the paths of the yield curve and the relative strength of growth versus value couldn't be separated from 2002 through 2011, the relationship soured in 2012 when the two came down with a case of the ten-year itch. At that point, they couldn't separate fast enough. The chart below shows the same two series from the start of 2012 through the present. Now, when one goes up the other goes down and vice versa, as the paths are nearly exact opposites. In fact, in the nearly eight years since 2012, the correlation between the two is -0.90.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/082219-YC-GV-2012-2019.png))**\n\n&gt; In the chart below we have shown the two series over the entire time period spanning 2002 through 2019. The non-shaded area represents the period covered in the first chart, while the shaded area covers the second period. Right around the time where the shaded period starts is when the positive correlation turned on a dime, and beginning in 2013 when the curve started to flatten, investors who were still hanging on to the idea that a flatter yield curve was a green light for value stocks, saw what turned out to be an extended period of misery relative to the performance of growth stocks. In the words of Intel Founder Andy Grove, \"Adapt or Die.\"\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/082219-YC-GV-2012-2019-Entire-Period.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Nasdaq 100 to S&amp;P 500 Ratio\n\n&gt; Below is a chart of the Nasdaq 100 going back to 1990. While it took 15+ years for the index to make a new all-time closing high following its March 2000 peak, the index is currently 65% above those March 2000 highs.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ndx100.png))**\n\n&gt; Below is a ratio chart of the Nasdaq 100's price versus the S&amp;P 500's price since 1990. The ratio started well below 1 in early 1990 but quickly overtook the S&amp;P in price by the mid-90s. As you can see, the ratio spiked dramatically above 3 during the peak of the Dot Com bubble in late 1999. The Nasdaq 100 then gave up much of that outperformance versus the S&amp;P 500 over a 2-3 year period where the ratio got all the way back down to 1, but since then it has been steadily trending higher to its current level of 2.65. While it went through a bubble and a burst over a 5-year period, the Nasdaq has been outperforming the S&amp;P 500 for a long time now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ndxratio.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending August 23rd, 2019** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2rknA4-2xY))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 08.25.19**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRJ4AlGZX-E))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$BBY** \n&gt; * **$MOMO** \n&gt; * **$OKTA** \n&gt; * **$DG** \n&gt; * **$VEEV** \n&gt; * **$ULTA** \n&gt; * **$OSIS** \n&gt; * **$BILI** \n&gt; * **$DLTR** \n&gt; * **$TIF** \n&gt; * **$NTNX** \n&gt; * **$ICLK** \n&gt; * **$ADSK** \n&gt; * **$SJM** \n&gt; * **$PLAN** \n&gt; * **$WDAY** \n&gt; * **$ANF** \n&gt; * **$DELL** \n&gt; * **$BURL** \n&gt; * **$FIVE** \n&gt; * **$BWAY** \n&gt; * **$JT** \n&gt; * **$MRVL** \n&gt; * **$BNS** \n&gt; * **$BMO** \n&gt; * **$HPE** \n&gt; * **$COTY** \n&gt; * **$TD** \n&gt; * **$ITRN** \n&gt; * **$HEI** \n&gt; * **$EXPR** \n&gt; * **$JILL** \n&gt; * **$WMWD** \n&gt; * **$MOGU** \n&gt; * **$CAL** \n&gt; * **$GES** \n&gt; * **$CPB** \n&gt; * **$BOX** \n&gt; * **$PVH** \n&gt; * **$BIG** \n&gt; * **$CHS**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/REAFEsy.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/TGKM5Yy.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/fykWlTA.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.26.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/upLUSDf.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.26.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/rWA27c1.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.27.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/XsN2sKT.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.27.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9IGFOzk.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.28.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/TrocNxW.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.28.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/btW54ZZ.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.29.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/rN4q8iu.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.29.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SVcDLmB.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.30.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AV8pPua.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.30.19 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/wallstreetbets.", "created_utc": 1566651170, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cut0xl/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/", "is_self": true}
