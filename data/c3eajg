{"id": "c3eajg", "title": "AMC Q2/Q3 earnings DD", "selftext": "Semi-shitty DD. I got the idea when all my friends went to go watch Toy Story 4 and none of the AMC theaters in our surrounding counties in SoCal had open seats. Regal Theaters , however, had plenty of open seats. I attribute this to AMC's theaters being much higher quality in terms of service and seating despite being a bit more expensive than Regal. \n\nAMC stock hit an all-time low today of about $10.31 (it's now floating at around $10.45~)which I think is unjustified. \n\nLast quarter had some pretty bad losses attributed to weak movie releases excluding \"Captain Marvel\" that did $1.1B worldwide and \"Us\" that did $235MM. Q4 2018 beat earnings because of strong releases that made analysts overestimate Q1 potential. Q2, however, had Avengers:Endgame more than double that that of Captain Marvel, at $2.74B worldwide. Along with Avengers:Endgame, Detective Pikachu did $450MM, and now with Toy Story 4 being released we're looking at a much stronger Q2 performance. The quarter cuts June 31st though, so be aware that not all of Toy Story 4's performance will be accounted next earnings report. The Lion King is scheduled for release in July so depending on what other releases follow it, it could also lead to a stronger Q3 and Q4. I listened to a conference with Credit Suisse from June 4th, 2019 and AMC acknowledges that the next few quarters are going to be much stronger because of all the Disney releases including the new Star Wars movie coming in December.\n\nAnalyst expectations aren't much higher for Q2 (at 0.20 EPS) which I think is a misjudgment and we can expect to see AMC smash earnings for the next few quarters.\n\nYou would expect all of this to be priced in, but the stock has been going down from $15~ since the start of May when the weak earnings were announced. \n\nI'm thinking some 9/20c $12/$14 and 12/20c $12/14 but who knows I might be retarded.\n\nTLDR; AMC is unreasonably low priced despite blockbusters and underestimated at the moment, Q2, Q3, Q4 will most likely smash earnings. \n\nCredit Suisse Conference Call: https://event.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1245909&amp;tp_key=85561177ee&amp;tp_special=8\n\nBox Office numbers you guys can just Google.", "created_utc": 1561141180, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c3eajg/amc_q2q3_earnings_dd/", "is_self": true}
