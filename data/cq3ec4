DD inside.", "selftext": "Alright- been hanging around this sub so much that I've stopped playing video games- and that means I'm less at risk to ruin your puts on firearms options, so trust me on this, since I'm ***obviously*** an expert.  \n\n\nYou all know EA- it's basically a meme and highly stigmatized within the gaymer community because they do stuff like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7cff0b/seriously_i_paid_80_to_have_vader_locked/dppum98/?st=JH2MUORV&amp;sh=5997c5a5), which is a good indicator of how the stock literally asks to go tits up. The stock the week after the comment was made *\\[Sun Nov 12 2017 14:11:23 GMT-0500 (EST)\\]* shows it falling, because MEMES [do have an impact on public opinion](https://imgur.com/a/r9VNri1).  \"EA bad \\[insert literally ANYTHING here\\] good\" rhetoric has been tossed around, till it's been replaced by \"FoRTnITe BaD\" \\[insert shit here\\] good.\" Now, those of you who have kids/nephews/grow-ass men in your basement who play the game will know that for all the hate it gets- it makes EPIC BIG TENDIES. And what else do you love more, since it's not a publicly traded stock- than to have it fall?   \n\n\nEnter **Apex Legends**\\- the bastard child of battle royale games and the Titanfall series, which has a chacter that perfectly represents [WSB](https://www.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/apex-legends-octane.jpg). The dude literally likes to shoot up on questionable substances, is Green (BULL GANG), and can yeet himself off a lauchpad like me yeeting myself off a 20-story nodescript office building because of my AMD calls. What more can you ask?   \n\n\nOver at r/FortniteCompetitive they're getting so frustrated with EPIC they're moving over to Apex legends to protest, which means a bunch of gambling addicts and big name streamers are going to get hooked on the game, and buy a shit ton of overpriced lootboxes- I mean, just look at FIFA. Shit makes EA money EVERY. SINGE. TIME even though people talk shit about it. So basically, more people playing the game -&gt; More people buying stuff -&gt; more profit for Respawn + EA. \n\n  \n**TL;DR Check**  r/FortniteCompetitive **- they're all migrating over to Apex Legends because EPIC Devs suck. New people, new tendies.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n/End", "created_utc": 1565749641, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cq3ec4/calls_on_ea_because_epic_sucks_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
