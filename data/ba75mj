Literally can't go tits up?", "selftext": "Here are my AMD July 21 $30 calls\n\nhttps://imgur.com/ZXm817w\n\nAnd here is a $33 covered call for May  24th\n\nhttps://imgur.com/zEpJ1kG\n\nI have never done a calendar spread before so I only covered 1 option out of the 3. Looking for advice from people who know more than me about this stuff.\n\nThe reason I am doing this is in case of a market turn down I will be able to buy to close the sold option for a profit and still have another couple months for the price to rebound for my July options. Theta will also be running faster on my May expiration sold call if the price stays stagnant.\n\nAlso, by taking profit on the covered call instead of cutting my losses on my contracts I will avoid any wash sales from my substantially identical securities on AMD the last 30 days. This is my biggest motivation for this strategy, I am trying to eliminate as many wash sales as possible this year. If my July options expire worthless that is still beyond 30 days of any profits made if the May option expires worthless for a gain.\n\nMy question is, in the case the market continues breaking out and AMD goes my strike price for the $33 covered call by expiration, will I be able to exercise one of my July contracts in order to cover the assignment?\n\nAlso, if there are any other downsides about this strategy I am not considering I would be very appreciative if we can discuss these.", "created_utc": 1554574197, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ba75mj/calendar_spread_literally_cant_go_tits_up/", "is_self": true}
