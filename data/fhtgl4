These data centers were powered by NVDA's AI chips.  If anyone remembers the press around these, they were the game changer.\n\nNow Intel has launched its Xeon chips which are 3.5 x faster and run on Intel's processing units meaning they are also much less expensive. Much less expensive... 99% less expensive... We're talking about a 100x price difference. This will take a while to play out in sales, but the growth prospects on old tech die hard.\n\nNext, is the pummelling NVDA is taking from AMD.  Ya \ud83d\udc02's.  That AMD.  AMD gained a 3% market share in Q4, while NVDA lost 1%.  This trend is only going to continue to pick up speed, driven by NVDA's focus on it's now defunct AI chips and ADAS.\n\nNext next, NVDA launched its gaming streaming service GeForce Go. Remember how awesome it was going to be to subscribe to games rather than buy them.  Makes a lot of sense as long as they have my favourite games.  BUT, the scales weren't balanced.  Last week Activision and Bethesda backed out and asked for their catalogs to be removed. Pricing always an issue and they want control.  Cest la vie GeForce Go, hello old friend, PS4.\n\nLast but not least, this beauty still has a rediculous 53 P/E ratio, market cap of $150B and a share price that has gone from $284 to $216 since last Wednesday. Guess what, it's down another $9 in aftermarket trading today. Why? Because of bull balls. If you had to think about rediculous valuations a month ago, this should've been on the top of your list.  Combine these head winds + covfefe virus, this thing is set to sink.\n\n**disclaimer, I dont know what I'm talking about, and that's great news for you fuckers.  That's how this works, right?\n\nSources:\nhttps://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2020/3/6/21168645/nvidia-geforce-now-2k-games-titles-bioshock-borderlands\n\nhttps://investorplace.com/2020/03/intel-stock-is-poised-to-outperform-on-chip-progress-and-ai-gains/amp/\n\nhttps://wccftech.com/amd-radeon-and-nvidia-geforce-discrete-gpu-market-share-q4-2019/amp/", "created_utc": 1584070861.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhtgl4/deep_otm_nvda_put_0320_110_008/", "is_self": true}
