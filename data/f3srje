Stocks only go up but only when they\u2019re not going down. Yesterday MSFT had a big long squiggly red line on robinhood. I\u2019m not quite sure what this means but red is bad. You cum guzzlers with weeklies either sold or are fucked. But the rest of us who aren\u2019t actually mentally handicapped bought Mid/Late March calls. In the long run MSFT will go up because it\u2019s like a bird.\n\ntl:de:  BTFD March 200C", "created_utc": 1581689759, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3srje/the_truth_about_msft/", "is_self": true}
