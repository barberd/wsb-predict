I haven't read good DD or any sort of plays on shit that isn't one of these two fucking tickers and I'm tired of it. I'm also tired of getting gaped by JPow. Real DD is hard to come by right now probably because everything's going up FOR NO FUCKING REASON and is defying all logic so what the fuck is the point of DD when the market doesn't follow reality. If you're like me and enjoy when the market follows reality boy do I have something for you. I'm no technical analysis master (voodoo master magician) so I'll just tell you why its going to go up instead of using crayons to guess. Dollar General, this shit was made by poor people for poor people, and you know what there are a lot of right now and going to be even more of every single day? POOR PEOPLE. Stocks only go up right, nothing is going down right now and it makes no sense, but for DG the shit makes sense. Their target market population is increasing every millisecond, every single unemployment claim that's being filed is more than likely a couple more sales for them. This shit listens to what's going on in the real world, it just makes sense, why is GME rising like a motherfucker when they were already failing as a business before this \"new great recession\"? Fuck if I know it doesn't make any sense, but why is DG rising through all of this? BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE. Poor people need to buy cheap things to live and Dollar General makes money selling them. Calls are cheap as hell right now too so get them while you can.\n\nDG 5/15 200C\n\nTLDR; More poor people because of failing economy means more business for DG fucking buy calls retards", "created_utc": 1586881989.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g18sxz/dg_you_fuckheads/", "is_self": true}
