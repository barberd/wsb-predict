I buy 10000 call options for $100 that end this week. 100% sure that it wont end above $100 because else the option-seller (the market maker) would lose a lot more than when it just shorts or sells a couple of shares to keep the stock price below $100.\n\nNow, we all have those coulda woulda shoulda stuff. I shoulda went for put options when FB crashed. I shoulda went for put options when BA crashed. I shoulda went for MU options \n\nEither way, there's an influence that buying options has on the stock itself. How big is it? Is there a chance that the 'I shouldve done X' scenario wouldve totally gone different if you actually did that thing?\n\nLike the guy who bought 50k $283 spy calls that expire this week; maybe spy wouldve gone above 283 (or at least wouldve gone less down than it does now) if this guy didnt buy all these call options?\n\nSincerely,\n\nSponce", "created_utc": 1553772790, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b6hnwf/regarding_coulda_woulda_shoulda_woulda_it_go/", "is_self": true}
