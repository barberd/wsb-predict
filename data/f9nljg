There are rumors about other things being unveiled as well (AirTag location beacons, headphones, iPad, and updated Macs).\n\nAnother rumor floating around is the potential announcement of ARM-based Macs. And one more potentially big thing, pull more consumers in, is setting iOS defaults to Google chrome and Gmail\n\nTLDR; Big gay virus makes now a good time to buy May AAPL calls. I have no position yet, and this is just information and is not financial advice. Do your own DD.
