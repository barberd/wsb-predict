{"id": "c8o9cy", "title": "Long Thesis: Global Blood Theraputics (GBT US)", "selftext": "Investment Thesis\n\nGlobal Blood Therapeutics ([GBT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GBT)) recently reported top-line results of its Phase III HOPE U.S. clinical study of Voxelotor in patients with Sickle Cell Disease or SCD. Following the positive phase III HOPE study clinical trial results on June 14, 2019, the stock price surged over 10% over the next week. We believe that the company is well-positioned to receive the FDA approval for Voxelotor for the treatment of SCD with a potential annual peak revenue of over $2 billion by the patent expiration in 2032. The efficacy and safety profile of 1500mg Voxelotor during phase III study was very strong, especially when compared to the lower dose of 900mg Voxelotor, which was used in the phase II study. Consequently, we find as the key near-term bullish catalyst the potential positive FDA approval of the New Drug Application or NDA, which will be released most likely later in H2 2019. The FDA approval might lift the stock price close to the analysts\u2019 consensus price target of $90.0 per share over the next 12 months.
