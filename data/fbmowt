And Papa Buffett has a massive penis. We all know short dudes with wide faces like Papa-B have massive schlongs. Anyways\n\nApple was nearly $330 less than 2 weeks ago, and now it's like $270 or some shit roughly. So it's not outside the realm of possibility that it goes down to $175 again. Kinda unlikely but who the fuck knows.\n\nIf you don't go womb deep (further than balls deep) into long dated Apple Calls or just pure Stock at that point, you have the downs (short for downs syndrome), which is worse than autism pretty much. Downs is like when there's a legit kinda solid opportunity in front of you and you just shit your pants and don't do anything. Trust me, I'd know, I've had downs before and got a vaccine. \n\nSo that's pretty much it. If Apple goes to $175 or lower buy all you can, long dated calls (6 months out +) or just Stock and then get rich probably. Otherwise you'll be like holy shit I was retarded not to do that, which you're probably still a retard, but may as well be a rich retard than a poor retard.\n\nTLDR: Buy Apple at $175 a share or under, or you have upside downs syndrome.", "created_utc": 1583026114, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbmowt/legit_chance_to_get_rich_possibly_upcoming_dd/", "is_self": true}
