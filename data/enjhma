{"id": "enjhma", "title": "Interview with large long only on Monday need investment pitch", "selftext": "So apparently I need to come up with an investment pitch or two for my interview on Monday. \n\nI'm thinking of going long $TSCO because a lot of their stores are located in Texas and other areas whose economic status is sensitive to the price of oil. The recent turmoil in Iran and the potential for more disruption in the middle East would be a positive for oil and therefore be positive to $TSCO. Furthermore, the 2020 elections are likely to induce transfer payments to rural areas that could be swing voters for Trump - again - a boost to $TSCO. \n\nI think it's a legit idea and I want to get some DD if you have any for me. Also any advice or other ideas are very much welcome. Thank you very much", "created_utc": 1578806888, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/enjhma/interview_with_large_long_only_on_monday_need/", "is_self": true}
