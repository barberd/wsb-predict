{"id": "g3f1w7", "title": "Amazon Earnings/General Post on Economic Outlook", "selftext": "This is my first post because I find wallstbets as more of a comedy piece before bed. Recently there has been some insane volatility and amazon continues to trend upward. They beat Q4 earnings by 88% and though I don\u2019t think they will destroy earnings, but they will definitely beat. With this quarantine - it would be hard not to. The buy analysts need to be careful w/ their price targets. Will be an interesting earnings week. Sold a 2370/2360 put spread expiring May 29th for a $500 credit. Juicy I must say and I\u2019m hoping to dump right after earnings (assuming they beat).\n\nEarnings week is a great week to see some movement in the VIX. This should move the S&P up a bit, but hold your shorts. The market will come crashing down as we are only piling on more debt and have another crisis on our hands. I also don\u2019t see those unemployed (significantly higher since 2008) opening up their wallets to spend. Retail will continue to crash and life moves on. I do see & believe that airline stocks bottomed out. For the long term - there is some serious upside because ..who\u2019s not going to fly? I know I need to. I have a fucking honeymoon coming up early next year. People will be eager to fly once this quarantine shakes out.\n\nAnyway, after earnings week, I would consider buying some SPY puts or strapping on some call spreads to protect the downside. If anyone has any ideas or suggestions - would like your output. Not sure how, but I always get burned on the short. Have only seen some recent gains on the bullish put spreads.\n\nI also rarely buy obviously as you are constantly battling theta. I need some juicy insurance on the downside. GIVE ME SOME OPTIONS \n\nFor now, Let\u2019s go #amzn", "created_utc": 1587173636.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g3f1w7/amazon_earningsgeneral_post_on_economic_outlook/", "is_self": true}
