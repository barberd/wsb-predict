{"id": "gnbkrw", "title": "Feeding The Rich ($CHEF Calls)", "selftext": "I've posted here [once before](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1vlpp/if_you_smellllllll_what_vince_is_cooking_wwe_calls/) and got a nice 3-bagger when WWE reported [monster earnings](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/wwe-reports-booming-profit-and-sales-after-furloughing-wrestlers-and-other-employees-2020-04-23).  Doesn't matter if you lay off a fuckton of people, that just means less expenses!  From that same sad but true line of thinking which brought you \"layoffs will actually positively affect this stock,\" another sad reality of life: not everyone is really suffering during this virus.  The Hamptons are experiencing absolutely [insane demand](https://variety.com/2020/dirt/news/demand-is-surging-for-lavish-vacation-rentals-in-the-hamptons-1234610840/). I have a bunch of friends who rent out properties there and confirm that everyone wants to get the hell out of the city, and there are a whole lot of people around here with the money to afford it.  Whereas we once naively thought PTON stock would tank because who the fuck is spending $2000 on an exercise bike when employment is hitting historic lows, it's become clear that if you have money odds are you're doing just fine (economically that is; rona will probably still kill your grandma).  As such, may I present: Chef's Warehouse.  I don't make a habit of pumping some random stock every week (RIP everyone's ULTA puts) but this is one of my favorite plays and I've sunk more than half of my portfolio balls-deep into this one.\n\nFrom their earnings report, \"The Chefs\u2019 Warehouse, Inc. ([http://www.chefswarehouse.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=g6mPUtZhRneBGCAaLDG33tXU5xlL29l8mkk_GJY9uecEFhz6kyUX4oZN2tg9rdlAAhvul5TODHHcMBaMLio_yidh0mNDKf9PUzu71KgTndSk2SrFEzs5W-1Cx7yc-z7e)) is a premier distributor of specialty food products in the United States and Canada focused on serving the specific needs of chefs who own and/or operate some of the nation\u2019s leading menu-driven independent restaurants, fine dining establishments, country clubs, hotels, caterers, culinary schools, bakeries, patisseries, chocolateries, cruise lines, casinos and specialty food stores. The Chefs\u2019 Warehouse, Inc. carries and distributes more than 55,000 products to more than 34,000 customer locations throughout the United States and Canada.\"  Translation: they're in the business of supplying rich people with food which is exciting because a) rich people can afford whatever they want and b) they have to eat.  They're also pivoting hard into their direct-to-consumer division which has sold above expectations.  APRN has proven to be trash; this is a higher end product catering to higher-end consumer and by a company with the industry know-how, supply chain and management team to make it work.\n\nA week and a half ago $CHEF  reported earnings and absolutely [crushed it](http://investors.chefswarehouse.com/news-releases/news-release-details/chefs-warehouse-reports-first-quarter-2020-financial-results).  To be fair most of these are pre-Corona #s but as mentioned I think this company is pretty well shielded from the worst effects of the post-Covid economy.  Not that that matters because apparently stonks only go up but...\n\n* Net sales increased 5.2% to $375.4 million for the first quarter of 2020 from $357.0 million for the first quarter of 2019.\n* GAAP net loss was $14.1 million, or $(0.48) per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2020 compared to net income of $1.1 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2019.\n* Adjusted EPS1 was $(0.60) for the first quarter of 2020 compared to $0.05 for the first quarter of 2019.\n* Adjusted EBITDA1 was $(13.8) million for the first quarter of 2020 compared to $13.2 million for the first quarter of 2019.\n* The Company had approximately $200.0 million of cash on the balance sheet and $33.4 million of availability on its asset-based loan facility as of April 30, 2020.\n\nFan of charts?  Check this one out:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iwsk9e6swuz41.png?width=955&format=png&auto=webp&s=fcca00d9a7a1ed800eb635c0f623d1ed63e23da4\n\nWhile most stocks have recovered to pre-Corona levels, this still has a lot of room to run.  Was trading around $40 for months and is now hovering around the $15 mark.  I'll leave the crayon drawings to someone more autistic than myself.\n\nShould I waste more time with stats, historic charts and other info that half of you aren't reading anyways?  Nah, it's Wednesday and I've got money to make and a wake-and-bake I should really get to.  Get on the Chef's Warehouse boat and thank me later.\n\nTL;DR - CHEF 6/19 15c.  Perfectly positioned to weather further lockdowns OR breakout to the upside if the \"lockdowns are being lifted\" narrative holds.\n\nDisclaimer: Not financial advice.\n\nSEC - I'm just trying to help a bunch of guys who drink their own piss.", "created_utc": 1589982253.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gnbkrw/feeding_the_rich_chef_calls/", "is_self": true}
