And it\u2019s time to buy a home!!\n\nMy Journey: lost about $3.5k last year learning the hard way about options. Invested about $300 in January (for options only) and turned that into about $4.5k in just a few weeks. \n\nTook out enough to cover the rest of my debt, letting the rest ride. And will be buying my first home come September. A lot of help from hitting daily singles and some very calculated \u201cyolos\u201d thanks to some decent DD from the WSB DD. Special thanks to $MCD, $Dis, $SPY, $Intel, $MSFT and $FOMO. \n\nBottom line, you\u2019d have to be nuts not to not make money in this market. It won\u2019t always be this way, and maybe I\u2019ve gotten lucky? But you really do need some Diamond hands, brass balls, and not giving a fuck about viruses to make it!\n\nThanks again, WSB!\n\nP.S. take the fucking gain!!!!!\n\nP.S.S. #17 Mike\u2019s Famous Philly", "created_utc": 1581031104, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f014fr/thank_you_wsb/", "is_self": true}
