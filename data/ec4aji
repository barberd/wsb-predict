I just look at the charts.  Fundamentals lie and deceive.  Any dip in NFLX here is buyable in my view.  Once it breaks out above 315 and goes up a lot, I wouldn't buy.  Some folks buy on strength.  That's very risky in my view unless you are an expert trader.  I am not.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been on the oil bandwagon for a little while.  It looks good.  USO is the pick.  I don't care about climate change or people switching to green energy.  I'm just looking at the technicals.  Maybe Iran is going to get blown up or something.", "created_utc": 1576626753, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ec4aji/for_the_folks_who_are_short_nflx_cup_and_handle/", "is_self": true}
