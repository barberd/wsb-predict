{"id": "fjzj9c", "title": "Any SPY equivalent just cheaper premiums?", "selftext": "The premiums on spy are fucking me in the ass with the high volatility. As someone only dealing with small fry money (~3k or so) I've managed to make some decent gains but it's so slow because I can only buy a few contracts at a time if I'm lucky, due to these ridiculous premiums. Saw someone recommend SMH, problem is the open interest is far lower, any suggestions for a small fry like me?  Any broad index fund trackers with low premiums or is that asking for the impossible?", "created_utc": 1584421483.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjzj9c/any_spy_equivalent_just_cheaper_premiums/", "is_self": true}
