This is a huge opportunity. Like PTON (y\u2019all know I love me some PTON) GAN has more demand than they can handle. Many states are bleeding revenue due to covid to the point where they will be unable to pay out unemployement. Covid has served as a catalyst for the legalization of online gambling.\n\nSo much so, that last Friday the ETF BETZ rebalanced their holdings and now GAN is the top weighted holding in that etf. This is a b2b company so it is not as well know as DKNG, and I feel the market has yet to realize its overall value.\n\nUnlike DKNG, GAN is not as susceptible to the cancellation of sports because the bulk majority of their revenue comes from online poker, slots etc.\n\nI am not a financial advisor and I am heartbroken after reading what happened to one of our RobinHood brethren\u2019s. So PLEASE do your research before buying. Consider buying shares instead of options if you are not in the position to handle a massive amount of risk. Consider buying before analyst upgrades and the announcement of more tier one clients but again do your own research and decide for yourself  - be a student, not a follower. Much love to my fellow retards.\n\nSide note - I would give a better DD but am behind the 8 ball at work. I will update when I get more free time.", "created_utc": 1592411009.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hauh8z/gan_ceo_we_have_more_business_opportunities_than/", "is_self": true}
