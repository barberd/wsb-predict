{"id": "ffl98l", "title": "TA $CCL is way below equity per share targets be careful with your puts/shorts - $30p 3/20", "selftext": "Obviously news catalysts have ripped this company apart and I do expect it to continue downward next week.  This is just to implore those who follow my TA to start thinking about setting their stops a little tighter.  If we look at last quarters filings you'll see that their total assets were 45.058B, total liabilities were 19.693B giving a stockholders equity of 25.365B.  If we divide SE by shares outstanding (527m) we get about 48.13 dollars per share.  Meaning if the company went bankrupt TODAY it could sell off all of it's assets, cover it's liabilities and still disperse $48.13 per share to each of it's shareholders.  Given the news and current trends I doubt it will go up but below is my current thought on why you should tread carefully with your puts/shorts.\n\nTicker: CCL\n\nWindow: Daily\n\nIndicators: 200 MA, RSI, ATR 2.39, SEC Filings (assets to liabilities, market cap, and shares outstanding.)\n\nSignals: Under 200 MA Bearish, RSI Oversold Bearish, Under SE Per Share Value.\n\nPosition: $30p 3/20 Short term put looking for exit, Stop at 29.89 following at 2.74 above current price\n\nTargets: The bottom has fallen out, hard to come up with future targets.  \n \n\nAnalysis: Very bearish signals overall however the stock value has drifted significantly under calculated equity per share last quarter. Tighten stops to 15% outside of ATR and ride out current position until stops are hit. After hitting stops exit the ticker entirely until there is some kind of positive news catalyst and look for long entries (call/buy).  \n \n\nFor the Retards: CCL is shit and it\u2019s going to get shittier but it\u2019s starting to look like boomer bait, use your stops like big boys.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://imgur.com/gallery/tuICVo8](https://imgur.com/gallery/tuICVo8)", "created_utc": 1583710060.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffl98l/ta_ccl_is_way_below_equity_per_share_targets_be/", "is_self": true}
