{"id": "e92m5w", "title": "$GME: The Big Short Squeeze", "selftext": "Updated today (12/10), WSJ reports 67.24M shares sold short (as of 11/29). During CC, management bought back a whopping 22.6M shares for $115.7 million in the quarter, at $5.11 per share. This followed a summer tender offer and more share buybacks earlier in the year, bringing the 2019 buyback total to 34.6 million shares for $178.6 million, at an average price of $5.14 per share. By quarter's end, there were only 67.8 million shares outstanding, down a huge 34% on the year. **This means that almost 100% of shares are sold short.** They have 1B in cash + credit (290M in cash + rest in a loan). Furthermore, the hard-to-borrow rate is 40% in IB.\n\nFrom Motley fool:\nSecond, retiring 34% of one's stock in a single year is fairly remarkable and a huge vote of confidence, especially since the company isn't exactly stretching its balance sheet. Even at the end of this horrible-looking quarter, GameStop has $290 million in cash and cash equivalents and only $419.4 million in debt. And of course, this is just before the holiday season, the highest sales quarter of the year, which should replenish the company's cash coffers by early 2020.\n\nIf the new PlayStation and Xbox do well enough to rejuvenate physical hardware and software sales for another multiyear console generation or longer, the recent repurchases could be incredibly value-enhancing to shareholders. But if digital streaming takes off in a bigger way and sales of physical games decline faster than anticipated, GameStop could continue to endure operating losses and may be headed for an even bigger fall.\n\nManagement believes that the former will happen, but not until the fourth quarter of 2020, when the new consoles hit the market. Until then, GameStop and its shareholders will have to hold on and hope. It remains a speculative deep value stock for risk-tolerant investors.", "created_utc": 1576040817, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e92m5w/gme_the_big_short_squeeze/", "is_self": true}
