{"id": "fppilf", "title": "Sbux Intel of 1 store", "selftext": "so sbux offered all partners the option to stay at home for 30 days and get paid. I opted for it so I can play the market :)\n\nANYWAYS\n\nSo my store is a DT store and I decided to go in today to pick up my tip money from last week. This is what I found out....\n\n* 1) Out of 25 partners, 3 of us took the month option\n* ---a partner who works once a week\n* ---a 18yr old partner who lives with parents\n* ---an autistic degenerate who wants to day-trade for the next 30 days\n\n* 2) My store usually does 875-950 customers per day. Currently they are doing 650 customers on avg.\n\n* 3) My store usually makes on avg $5300 per day. Currently they are avg about $4500 a day.\n\n* Sbux incentivize anyone who opted to work will get a temp $3/hr and Overtime is approved. \n\n* Sbux also recently announced, if you are working, you get 1 additional partner mark out on food and on drinks per work day. Also any partners not working are entitled to also get 1 partner markout on food or drink during their days off. After that there is a 50% discount on any other purchases, an increase from 20% previously. \n\n* Sbux also has a dedicated Covid-19 CUP Fund. Cup Fund is usually reserved for emergency and u need some money. I dont know what the max is on normal times. But they have allocated $500 per partner for the Covid-19. Reading the form, it seems almost anything will be approved for this special cup fund and I am sure many partners will be taking advantage of a free $500 no strings attached.\n\nDo what you will with that Info.\n\nedit: Spelling", "created_utc": 1585278411.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fppilf/sbux_intel_of_1_store/", "is_self": true}
