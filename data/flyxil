Long dated puts on anything non-essential: \n$LYV, $EXPE, $CCL, $MGM, $SBUX. If the premiums are too high, find other companies that are affected by risk aversion.\n\nThe autist bulls are trying to spin a new story: *\u201cYeah, the economy is basically shut down for 1, 2 or 3 months but then everything comes back roaring into action*\u201d Just watch CNBC for an hour to know what I'm talking about. They are right that we're not going to go Mad max. But even in the best case scenario, consumer behavior will be severely affected.\n\nHowever, once lockdowns around the world are starting to be lifted, don't expect people to walk into e.g. Starbucks like they used to before. **This is not priced in.**\n\nWhy is this? \n\n1) Well, a lot people are still gonna try to avoid large crowds because they haven't been infected (yet). Doctors and institutions don't say everyone will get infected. This will play a significant role until a vaccine is developed. \n\n2) A lot of people have just been laid off (and people still with a job saw how easy it was for others to get laid off). ~75% or so might go straight back to their original job, but with the knowledge that their employer will let them go if they have to shut down for a few weeks. Of course this can be a good thing as people can get benefits. However, this will result in a major risk-averse consumer trend that is hard to break. Some people were perhaps considering buying a new 47-inch TV before? However, after the lockdown people rather keep money at hand, as people perceive their jobs, the economy and the world as more fragile than they could ever imagine. Hence, people will save up for future bad times and avoid frivolous purchases. This is absolutely disastrous for consumer spending, and therefore the economy as a whole.\n\nOf course, there will be a slight peak after lockdowns. People will spend their $1000 on stupid shit once they are able to.
