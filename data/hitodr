{"id": "hitodr", "title": "Tiffany & Co - The $15 Buyout Spread Play - DD", "selftext": "Tiffany & Co - The $15 buyout spread play - DD\n\nLVMH announced it would be buying Tiffany & Co $TIF at $135 a share back in November 2019.\u00a0\n\nUpon the announcement, shares rocketed from \\~$90 to \\~$134, as investors priced in a slight chance that the deal would fall through. Shares remained stable at $134 until the coronavirus crash, falling down to \\~$111 in March and then recovering back up to \\~$128 until the start of June. Leaks of a potential renegotiation from stemming from LVMH to lower the acquisition price once again caused the stock to fall to \\~$115 and again recovering back up to \\~$124 when the rumor was debunked by LVMH themselves. They realized the acquisition contract was solid and the legal battle to renegotiate was more costly than to pay the premium to acquire the luxury jeweler. Tiffany & Co even amended debt covenants not to break contract agreements.\u00a0\n\nSince then, it has been radio silence. So what is holding up the deal? Anti-trust approvals from the countries that Tiffany & Co has brick and mortar stores in. Each time approval is given, a SEC filing is issued. Below are each country and current status as of 6/30/2020:\n\n1. US - **Approved**\n2. Canada - **Approved**\n3. Australia - They are pushing to receive approval ASAP.\u00a0\n4. Mexico - **Approved**\n5. the European Union - Draft sent. When final is sent, Approval is 25 days unless an investigation is performed\n6. China - **Approved**\n7. Japan - Draft sent. When final is sent approval is within 1 month unless an investigation is performed\n8. South Korea - **Approved**\n9. Taiwan - Draft sent\n10. Russia - **Approved**\n\nAustralia is the most important country in this list (for once). Their Foreign Investment Review Board asked to extend the review of the acquisition until October back in March, at the peak of the virus. The original deadline was set for April (I believe, whatever it is not important). Australia lowered its foreign investment threshold to $0, meaning any foreign investment would be reviewed as they felt threatened by the hostile foreign takeover of Australian businesses as coronavirus hit. In every SEC filing they issue the following statement:\n\n\"Registrant expects to be in a position to \\*\\*close the Merger in the middle of 2020\\*\\*, subject to, as previously announced, the actual length of the Australian Foreign Investment Review Board\u2019s extended review of the transaction\"\n\nAgain, the have issued this statement with each individual country's approval, so it must bear importance on WHEN. WHEN is the difference between tendies and no tendies. WHEN will the deal close? That is the question. Tomorrow is the official start of H2, meaning the exact middle of 2020 has passed.\n\nWhy does IF not matter anymore? Two pieces of evidence.\u00a0\n\n\"Mr. Bogliolo finished his comments by saying: \u201cFor these reasons, and as I stated earlier, I am confident that Tiffany\u2019s best days remain ahead of us and I am excited we will be taking that journey with LVMH by our side.\" - Source, page 2 [https://investor.tiffany.com/static-files/02740794-f42e-49f4-9d43-5c8ec49229b5](https://investor.tiffany.com/static-files/02740794-f42e-49f4-9d43-5c8ec49229b5%5D(https://investor.tiffany.com/static-files/02740794-f42e-49f4-9d43-5c8ec49229b5))\n\n\"At LVMH's virtual AGM today, a shareholder asks if co was still satisfied with the deal to buy Tiffany and when it would close. Groupe MD Antonio Belloni says: \"We think that Tiffany is one of the most emblematic brands in jewelry so it has a just place in our portfolio.\" - Source [https://twitter.com/labboudles/status/1277946838218346496](https://twitter.com/labboudles/status/1277946838218346496)\n\nThe second comment from LVMH is why the stock is up 1.2% today. It hasn't moved more than 1% in the past 2 weeks.\n\nSo it looks like the deal is on. Surprisingly, no one on the market seems to care. Or at least not as much when the deal was announced back in November when they were pricing in \\~$1 for a no deal scenario.\u00a0\n\nAgain, radio silence on this deal lately. The only article I saw that even mentioned the deal was this SA article that got absolutely buried. It didn't come up on Robinhood news nor did it come up on Macroaxis. Reddit bans SA articles so just google \"Tiffany is a Trader's Best Friend\" and it is the first article.\n\nWhat's the play? 8/21 $130c. This date and strike has 4,052 open interest and has remained for weeks. If you want to be extra safe, go in on November calls. This is after the Australian gov is required to give approval.", "created_utc": 1593543426.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hitodr/tiffany_co_the_15_buyout_spread_play_dd/", "is_self": true}
