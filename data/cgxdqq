Within 2 weeks after 45 is hit itll drop down to around 32.", "selftext": "Ban me if I'm wrong but its really a sure thing so you can just make me mod now to save time. Its p obvious tbh, yeti exceeded eps estimate q1 when their sales are always lowest, but stock price still dropped after eps announcement because of how low sales were. Now its hot af everywhere so people bought a ridiculous amount of yeti junk so eps will be sky high. Then once people start selling off the stock will stabilize again and slowly start to decline until it hits reasonable numbers.", "created_utc": 1563910856, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cgxdqq/yeti_will_hit_45_within_a_week_after_earnings_for/", "is_self": true}
