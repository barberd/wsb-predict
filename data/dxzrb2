Like for 11/22 98.5 put is 2.40 and 98 is just 0.39. so my spread will be a net credit of 2.01 (2.40-0.39). However Robinhood won't take my order of 2.01 as my collateral is just 50 bucks, ie 150 less than credit. Has anyone ever experienced this? And why is that?", "created_utc": 1574060715, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dxzrb2/rh_error_order_premium_must_be_less_than_the/", "is_self": true}
