You gotta write some DD, and that DD has to be proven correct. Then, my son, you will be a GOD.\n\nThis is not as difficult as it may sound... There are a few easy tricks to write your very own GENIUS DD that predicts the market, and few will be wise to the tricks you've actually pulled.\n\nLet's start with a simple formula, as an example:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The market is going to reach \\~X, and then drop to \\~Y.  \n>  \n>However, if it reaches \\~X+A, then it will rise to \\~Z.\n\n(Note: X, Y, and Z all have to be reasonable possibilities given the current market. These can't be insane numbers.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThink about these statements as a prediction. First of all, it is important to note that there is NO TIME FRAME LISTED! This is absolutely key, because it means there is no deadline for your predictions to be refuted. So long as your prediction has missed, you can keep telling people to be patient and that you didn't predict WHEN it would occur. This gives your prediction a massive amount of leeway and basically guarantees a correct prediction at some point.\n\nAt some point we will hit X, because stonks only go UP (long term). Saying a stock will rise to X and not giving a timeframe means I have a guaranteed correct prediction right off the bat. EZ WSB respect there, bro.\n\nNow look at the next trick... Once it hits \\~X, it will drop... Unless it hits \\~X+A, in which case it will rise.\n\nSo either it will drop, or it won't drop in which case it will continue to rise... This shit is basically a fucking truism! Either it hits X and rises (meaning we bottomed) or hits X and drops (meaning a bull trap), either fucking way the prediction is \"correct.\" If I came to you and said \"either we bottomed or this is a bull trap,\" you would realize I'm a fucking idiot saying something obviously true. But because I attached hard numbers that are easily predictable in both cases, and a few fancy graphs with lines on them, I'm a WSB TA GOD.\n\nNote again, the drop to Y is not given any timeframe, either. If it hasn't hit Y I can just say \"be patient, I didn't tell you WHEN it would hit Y.\" If I'm lucky, several months later when it never hits Y hopefully nobody will even remember this shitty DD I made and life will move on. If I'm even luckier, it will hit Y, in which case I will be revered as the greatest market magician in the history of the sub.\n\nIf I wasn't a retard I wouldn't even be telling you all this, I'd simply make such a formulaic post and reap the sweet, sweet karma and forum GODHOOD that comes as a result. But to be honest I don't give a fuck about your retarded upcummies, and this account will probably be banned in a week like all the rest of my accounts anyways.\n\nPositions: IWM 100p 7/17", "created_utc": 1586217543.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fw9zcd/how_to_write_dd_that_is_never_wrong_the_cold/", "is_self": true}
