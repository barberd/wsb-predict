BUT for the 7 of you that surpass the 75% literacy rate down here, I have the BECKY info for 2020. \n\nFound this shop today and they make Sabanas (bed sheets) AND MORE. Clearly this is some poorly translated Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond slogan. BECKY is getting ready to unload her hand crafted, zero emission, vegan, gluten free, cum resistant bed sheets back up to the US with a 5,000,000% markup. Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond is the main supplier and about to go OFF. BECKY suppling BECKY.  \nWhat tipped me off? $BBBY is currently  trading at exactly $15. What can you get with $15 USD? Exactly 115.49 Guatemalan Quetzales which is the price $PYPL was trading at when I took that photo. Clearly BECKY is opening up shop down here, taking Paypal to avoid reporting too many taxes and Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond is going to clear a massive margin.   \nThree pigeons fighting over a pupusa indicated a BBBY target price of well over 1,400 USD by March.
