I\u2019ll make a fortune I\u2019ll make back all my SPY losses! \n\nBought 50 contracts, then thought it was too good to be true and bought 50 $4 and $5 calls. I\u2019m gonna be rich! \n\nAn hour later I read that Barclays is redeeming the ETN on the 30th and suspended issuance. \n\nCalled the Barclays ETN desk to demand the value of my calls! The guy who answered was disgusted, told me he couldn\u2019t tell me the value of my options and to call the OCC... \n\nHe then started laughing. Just laughing at me in my peak autism. \n\nI have arrived.\n\nTLDR: bought worthless calls on a fund that they announced was being closed two days ago.
