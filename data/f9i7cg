Remdesivir. [https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/who-gilead-remdesivir-coronavirus/](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/who-gilead-remdesivir-coronavirus/) \\- Moderna was up 6 points today, Gilead down 3, and Gilead also has the leading AIDs drugs right now, including a brand new one that is practically a full prophylactic for carriers who have partners.\n\nSadly, a Chinese company, Brightgene, has already copied it and started giving it away in China.\n\nOther related Covid stocks are Zoom (ZM) because of its teleconferencing products, and Vocera (VCA) which is a teleconferencing product made specifically for healthcare workers (up 2.19%) or $.57/share.  \n\n\nI am not sure Moderna (MNRA) is a real player. Their stock was up last week but after some corporate DD it went down for a couple of days. Suddenly this week they had a new candidate to offer the WHO, but its efficacy cannot be confirmed for several months.\n\nAPT: Alpha Pro Tech which makes masks, etc. here in the US (APT - up over $10 today, 40%) - so no fear of China cutting us off.  \n\n\n**TL/DR: covid stocks = GILD, ACT, VCRA, ZM, MRNA (Moderna).**", "created_utc": 1582668435, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9i7cg/covid19_stocks/", "is_self": true}
