If this doesn't apply to you, congrats, you're better than us. For those who have been getting railed over and over no matter what move you make, I have the move for you. Prepare to jizz your pantaloons.\n\nJohnson and Johnson.\n\nI'd like to start of with the fact that a few people bought some extremely far OTM calls today, totaling to well over 2 mil in premium. I'd also like to add that in the race for the vaccine they are the winning candidate when it comes down to it. They have the money, the staff, etc. while moderna and all these shit-tier biotechs (don't forget gay-liead) know they can't compete so they announce every little move they make, hoping it moves the stock up, moving up their valuation, attracting more investors, so maybe, just maybe, they can get out of this intact when JNJ shoves a vaccine syringe up their ass.\n\nMost importantly, I have heard from important people (one being a FAANG exec) (Direct and indirect) that JNJ is releasing a vaccine or adequate treatment before the month ends. (not insider trading, because im starting to see this news leak around the web, and the massive option trade mentioned above)\n\nTo conclude, for those who started with 400 bucks, made 10k, 20k, maybe even 75k, and have lost it all, I feel your pain. I am here to offer you this chance to make some back, get another W under that belt, and get some investor confidence back, because second guessing yourself is 100% why we all start losing like that.\n\nTLDR: YOLO FAR OTM JNJ 165/175 7/17 Calls\n\nLMK if yall have any questions, happy to help.", "created_utc": 1593017464.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hf4k8l/jnj_the_only_responsible_yolo_of_your_life/", "is_self": true}
