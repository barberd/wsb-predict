Warning, this post is a wall of words.", "selftext": "Previous post:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7ibxy/the\\_tea\\_leaves\\_are\\_more\\_irrational\\_today\\_than/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7ibxy/the_tea_leaves_are_more_irrational_today_than/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOptions are built out of many moving parts. Understanding what you're buying (and why its valued the way it is) is an important thing to understand when you're trying not to lose your shirt. The most important thing to take away is that these things are all multipliers of value to some degree. This is why options can sky rocket or crater so damn fast, and why they have so much risk. In exchange for multiplying your potential gains (and losses), you'll need to pay for decay, which we'll also cover. There is no opposite for time decay, its a one way fee based on the decay of time an option has left.\n\nHere are the parts we'll talk about today:\n\n1. Intrinsic value\n2. Delta\n3. Gamma\n4. Theta\n5. Vega\n6. Rho\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Intrinsic Value\n\nIntrinsic Value is the overall starting value for an option. Note that there are still other things to pay for in the \"premium\", so this alone doesn't control the price of your option, but it is the biggest contributor (positive OR negative). When you hear the terms \"in the money\" (ITM) or \"out of the money\" (OTM) they're referring to whether the (Stock Price) + (Intrinsic value) = positive or negative value at any given moment. Remember that being \"in the money\" doesn't mean profitable to YOU. You can pay $100 for an option that is \"in the money\" and sell it for $95 and it might still be \"in the money\". Important distinction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIntrinsic Value = Price Difference between the Current Stock price (CUP) and the Option Strike Price (OSP)\n\nExample\n\nStock Price = $100\n\nStrike Price = $105\n\n\"Call\" Intrinsic Value = -$5 (who wants to buy a share for 105 when the current price is 100?)\n\n\"Put\" Intrinsic Value = $5\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. Delta\n\nDelta is the measurement that is used to determine how much the value of an option when the underlying stock goes up or down. Delta gets bigger and smaller the closer / farther you are to the CUP. An option with delta gets more value from a price movement the closer it is to the CUP.\n\nExample 1:\n\nCUP: $100\n\nOption Strike Price: $100\n\nOption Implied Value: $0\n\nDelta: 1\n\nThe stock price goes up $1, totalling $101\n\nA delta of 1 means that when there is movement of the underlying, you'll receive movement on a 1:1 ratio (so equal) movement.\n\nThe option Implied value becomes worth $1\n\nCongrats, you just made $100 off of a $1 movement (100 shares increased sale price movement of +$1/share). Of course There are other factors, but this is a decent explanation of just this one.\n\nExample 2:\n\nStock: $100\n\nOptions Strike Price: $50\n\nOptions Implied Value: $50\n\nDelta: .5\n\nThe stock price goes up $1, totally $101.\n\nA delta of .5 means that when there is movement of the underlying, you'll receive movement on a 1/2  ratio movement.\n\nOptions implied value: $50.50\n\nYou've only made $50 on this $1 price change, because delta was smaller. What this means is that there is a diminishing return on delta, the farther from the price of the underlying you are. What you should also realize, is that if the stock price had gone down $1 instead of up $1, you'd have lost $2 per share, for a total of -$200. This is why a call way OTM can see 100-1000x gains, because its using the exponential gains that you see when an OTM option gets closer and closer to ITM. Keep in mind that go too farm OTM, and you might have difficulty finding a buyer or seller.\n\nMaximum value of a delta call: +1.00\n\nMaximum value of a delta put: -1.00\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Gamma.\n\nGamma is the rate at which delta has generally moved over time. What does this mean?  It gives you an idea of the \"stability\" of an option. The closer you are to the CUP, the higher gamma will be, since it is a reflection of how often Delta changes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaximum value of Gamma: 1.0\n\n4. Theta is the combination of two things. <Volatility of CUP> + <Time left on the option before expiration>. Note that the next two examples could both have the same valuation for Theta, even though the parts are different.\n\nExamples:\n\nOption has a theta of (4)\n\n2 for Volatility of CUP\n\n2 for Time left till exp.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOption has a theta of (4)\n\n1 for Volatility of to CUP\n\n3 for Time left till EXP\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIts important to understand that Theta is built off two moving parts. The \"Time left\" side of Theta decays as you get closer to the expiration date of the option, which is why decay decreases the value of your options over time from their theoretical potential.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5. Vega\n\nVega is a measurement the theoretical range the CUP might move in the future. Put simply, it is a volatility measurement. An option that doesn't have much moment might still have high vega, implying that it can be expected the option is capable of making a larger or smaller movement in the near future. Something to note: Vega is a theoretical measurement, but you pay real value for it. If the vega of an option is 2.00 when you buy it, and 1.00 the next day, it simply means the CUP is no longer expected to be as volatile. You have however, lost money unless that Vega returns.\n\nHigher vega probably means you're buying something when its more expensive than it normally is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n6. Rho, the bastard forgotten step-child.\n\nRho is the measurement of the change that would occur to the option's value if the interest rate were to change 1%. You basically won't ever use this, as it takes a lot of calculation, and is better left for Robo-traders that are able to do the math fast enough for it to be relevant. You might be interested in Rho if you were trading on a sufficiently large quantity and time scale, such as 1 year. I have never factored Rho into my decisions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, two more important terms to understand. Decay and implied volatility. Lets start with IV, since IV tends to crush people.\n\nImplied Volatility\n\nIf I were to sell you a lottery ticket, and I told you it would never be worth more or less than $1, how much would you pay for it? That's right. $1. What I told you the ticket MIGHT be worth $2 tomorrow. Now you might pay for the risk that it increases in value, so you offer me $1.10 for the risk that you'll make some money. Now, lets remember that IV also includes losing value, so your lottery ticket might actually become worth -$1. That's right, you might owe ME money for holding my lottery ticket. How does this work with options?\n\nIf you buy a lottery ticket option, you don't know actual value that it will get to, only your guess. But you do know the current volatility, so theoretically it COULD be worth X more. Well, if you're at 100% volatility, because times are crazy, and you buy my $100 ticket, when times settle down, that volatility will reduce too, so that $100 ticket becomes worth $50. How could you end up owing money? Buy on margin. If you buy a $1000 lottery ticket on 10x margin (so $100=$1000) and the value of that ticket drops $500 because you bought during the most volatile time, you're on the hook for the difference in value between what you borrowed and what your asset is now worth. Margin is risky. I don't play margin because I like to keep my numbers real and in front of me. If you're buying during a volatile time period, don't hold the option for more than a 0-15 minutes in my opinion. High IV means I'm making a super short play to avoid IV as much as possible. Personally, I prefer to play the 2/1 minute charts during high IV to minimize my risk of IV crush. If I made a bad play? Oh well, take the loss. IV crush will multiple that loss very quickly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDecay.\n\nThere are 2 primary types of decay. Volatility and Time. We've covered most of volatility, but there is an important analogy to remember about volatility. It is like a rubber band being twang'd. Large amounts of movement, and then reverberations that slowly die. Why is that? Volatility always wants to return to zero, just like your rubber band. What keeps it high? New catalysts. Without external forces, volatility will always die out eventually. If you buy during high volatility, you need to know that it will stay volatile, or you need to get out before it does.\n\nTime. This one is straight forward. The length of time an option has till expiration gives you more chances to get rich, or more chances to get poor. You pay for those chances (even though you only get to cash out once). As you get closer to expiration, you have fewer chances remaining, so the value of time goes down. Simple as that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA simple 'what I check' when considering a buy:\n\nIs this a buy-and-hold for a far off event? If so, am I buying during the most volatile time of day? You can save a lot of money by buying the same AMZN options at 11:30AM by avoiding the higher IV of 945am or 345pm.\n\nAm I paying a time premium for something I expect to happen today/tomorrow? I generally don't buy anything with more than 1-2 days of trading left if I'm day trading 5 minutes or less, because why pay premium for something you're not going to hold onto? If I think there will be an event 7 days out, I will generally buy 14 or 21 days out simply to save on the amount of decay I pay for, since decay accelerates the closer you get to expiration. Note: If your hypothesis fails, you still cash out. Don't wait for the \"what if it comes back\" to eat you alive. Part of having time premium 'left on the bone' is to sell it to some other shmuck because now he'll have \"plenty of time\" and you're not holding the bag. Having more time till exp means they'll be more expensive, and your money will be tied up longer. If I don't have a real reason the stock should go down, when choosing my strike price I use an average factor of the yearly expected rate and rise to guesstimate the appropriate strike number.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope this helps next time you make that decision, do i REALLY need to buy this put for 7 days out at the most volatile part of the day?
