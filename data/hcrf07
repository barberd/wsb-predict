{"id": "hcrf07", "title": "Make This Play", "selftext": "The Play Until July\n\nIn my previous post, which for no good reason was by gay mods before it gained any traction, I discussed why buying black owned companies would take off. It\u2019s safe to say that those stocks have done quite we for themselves with someone gaining 3,000% weeks following the post. \n\nIt\u2019s important to stay in the know and be ahead BEFORE the run up:\n\nBuy BETZ + JETS calls for July 17th and out. \n\nHedge with 10% value on ITM Norwegian and RCL puts.\n\nBuy up every airliner leap calls for Jan 2021 10-20% OTM. Buy up July/August calls for UAL/SAVE/AAL as they will be active for the summer. \n\nHedge with UAL/SAVE/AAL puts for July. Why? Because summer is going to be in the spotlight to see how the rest of the year may go for these highly active airliners (stock movement wise). This will effectively set you up with a straddle as hedge. \n\nNKLA is also another great pick to look at. They have official registrations for their truck on June 29th, AZ factory construction on July 23rd, and NIKOLA World reveal of their truck by them. Btw, this shit sounds gay af, like a rave for truckers, rich farmers, and plaid wearing cowboys. A straddle here would do well seeing how much this stock can flux on just a 3D drawing reveal, and how much it consolidated after. Straddle OTM for 20% out for July 17th or further out (recommended if you have capital). They\u2019ll either pop off quickly or hit the core back to the 20/30s like Virgin. \n\nSpeaking of Virgin Galactic (gay mid removing my post for typing ticker symbol because \u201clow liquidity\u201d), I think it\u2019s going to get a round two of hype. Company is kinda slowing down and becoming more reclusive. Yolo some Jan 2021\u2019s in there because you never know, that run up might happen again and you don\u2019t want to miss out for cheap. I think we can all recall the days where it was in the teens and then ran to 40s within weeks. If JETS etf gains traction, this will pop off. Track it!\n\nLast thing I recommend is some spy calls, because Amuurica. Don\u2019t yolo this because we\u2019re close to ATH.\n\n\nTLDR: Fuck you I ain\u2019t retyping it", "created_utc": 1592678466.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hcrf07/make_this_play/", "is_self": true}
