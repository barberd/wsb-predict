One travels globally, one is north america flying only.\n\nBy that logic, all regional airlines stocks will tank as well because of this panic (Plot twist...regional airlines have contracts to fulfill flights that are spread across multiple years, and the flights go regardless of attendance)\n\nI could see Air Cargo being affected; not just the flying public. Flights to china cancelled? Well FedEx and UPS have a problem....\n\nNot to mention, that winter is calm for flying and summer/spring break are when things ramp up. The plans and execution to ramp up will go regardless of virus. Peoples attendance may vary, but the flights will go.", "created_utc": 1582766466, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fa43mm/airline_puts/", "is_self": true}
