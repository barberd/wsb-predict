{"id": "bq5zfl", "title": "Trading psychology - you are your own worst enemy", "selftext": "After years of losses in the stonk market, trial by fire, losing many tens of thousands through the next hot tip, gullible bag holding for the next PR, being a refined StockTwits pump and dump connoisseur with a fine preference for the dump, and spray and pray trading entering trades with no fucking clue why, I\u2019ve slowly become a better trader. Over years. \n\nThrough set rules, risk management, and technical analysis, I can muster out a good 1-2% on more trades then I lose the -0.5% predefined loss on. I\u2019ve been practicing with a $25k account, all in each trade, lasting seconds to a day or two. No cheap shit, and nothing volatile. Look for smoothly up-trending stocks. Goal is to get comfortable and practice with the $25k, and deposit a fat stack to start trading with a $100k account. \n\nSo after feeling like I finally figured shit out, for whatever reason, must be from seeing ALL THOSE FUCKING $DIS GAINS a while back, the gambler in me came out. On Thursday after making my gains for the day and literally FEELING the market 3 times, I gave into greed and I broke my stop loss rules, started to overtrade, and gave back 3 days worth of gains. \n\nPissed the fuck off and thinking about faggots buying $DIS calls with life savings because they read somewhere that DIS is buying pron hub, and thinking of the fact that these faggots will likely make so much god damn money on their ignorance... I let my emotions get the better of me. I decided to get into a $25k position on Thursday, $2.05 SPY 290 May 29 calls. A spray and pray. For no fucking reason. I still don\u2019t know how I snow balled that bad over a few days  profit losses. \n\nAnyways. \n\nThat bitch SPY opened bloody red on Friday and my $2.05 option is now at $0.95, over -50% loss. Watched futures take a shit the entire day. I\u2019m currently on a time zone where market opens at 5:30 pm so I had to suffer all fucking day with futures taking a shit and China talking shit... didn\u2019t feel like eating that day, focus was shit, extremely stressed and kicking myself for letting my emotions get me into such a nasty position. \n\nI got fucking lucky. The strong open gave me back most of my losses and I sold near the top. A $13k loss turned into a $3k loss and I couldn\u2019t be more fucking happy. Nothing I can\u2019t come back from. \n\nIf you\u2019re a day trader and have a system, probably low percentage of you here, stick to it. Temptations are everywhere in the market. Check your emotions at the door. Stay true to your trading, even if it\u2019s slow and repetitive, careful of that itch. Walk away after a losing streak. Close the computer, and walk the fuck away. \n\nI\u2019m grateful for the lucky comeback and just felt like sharing in case some of you throw caution to the wind and go balls deep into an FD because you\u2019re greedy or angry or saw some 19 year old faggot turn $500 Christmas money into $50k, whatever the reason. Just close positions, accept the loss, and walk away before it turns into something you never intended to. \n\nTL:DR; broke my system rules and revenge traded into a $25 faggots delight on SPY and got out with a $3k loss instead of $13k. Sharing to spare some of you retards who head down this road.", "created_utc": 1558197778, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bq5zfl/trading_psychology_you_are_your_own_worst_enemy/", "is_self": true}
