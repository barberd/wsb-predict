The goal of this started as a way to try and capture common trading ideas so people can stop stalking Robinhood and instead test and automate out their investment ideas. Now we're actually making an app for it lol. So, we're back and we've made some changes and a even a little prototype: [www.strattyx.com/prototype](https://www.strattyx.com/prototype)\n\nWe're almost done building mobile and plan to release on Test Flight this summer and the final in the autumn but wanted more feedback before we start the front end (backend is way ahead).\n\nAny feedback on the feedback would be great on UI and design and general flow and any metrics you think we should have listed in Testing phase.\n\nif u wanna sign up to test with real money this summer sign up here: [www.strattyx.com](https://www.strattyx.com) Otherwise, enjoy the demo until we launch :D\n\nSome shots of UI as well: [https://imgur.com/a/NRPjNcK](https://imgur.com/a/NRPjNcK)", "created_utc": 1557113512, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bl6zqj/feedback_on_my_mobile_algo_trading_app_round_2/", "is_self": true}
