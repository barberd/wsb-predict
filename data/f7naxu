{"id": "f7naxu", "title": "Coronavirus protip", "selftext": "Watch the diamond princess cases. Nobody knows the true mortality rate yet because of the unknown true number of cases worldwide. The Diamond Princess is our case study. The denominator is well known. \n\nAs of right now, 650 people are infected.\n\nBear case:\n\nIf more than 19 people end up dead in the coming weeks, we are looking at a 3% mortality rate and worst case scenario. Assuming 10% of human population infected by year end (similar to H1N1), that's 23,000,000+ deaths. That is a nightmare scenario. It is already known that the virus is much more contagious than influenza. A highly contagious virus that kills 1 in 33 people is not priced in to the markets.\n\nIf 12 people die, we are looking at 2% mortality and 15,000,000+ deaths worldwide. This is a horrific scenario. A virus that kills 1 in 50 is not priced in to the markets. \n\nThe current death count sits at 2, and the disease is running its course - there are a number of people \"seriously ill\" according to the CDC, but I cannot find the exact number. We will know in about 3 weeks with a high degree of certainty what the mortality rate is. \n\nKeep your eyes peeled for that death count on diamond princess.", "created_utc": 1582344441, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7naxu/coronavirus_protip/", "is_self": true}
