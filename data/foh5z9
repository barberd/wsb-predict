In fact, I love it. \n\nRobinhood margin calls me every time the market turns green. My retarded ass was going to buy puts yesterday but RH margin called my account. I said \u201cfuck you Robinhood, I\u2019m going to sell my puts and unlock my account!\u201d Well, I sold at bottom and got ready to drop some $$$ into retarded FDs. \n\nWait a minute. Your account only unlocks the trading day AFTER you fill the margin call. Oops. \n\nLuckily for me, the market went green today as my account restriction lifted. You already know my autistic ass bought all the SPY puts at the lowest of the day. (oops) I\u2019ll report back when I get margin called again bois. \n\nGodspeed to all you \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bs.\n\nTL:DR SPY $69p 4/20 or bust\n\nEDIT: https://ibb.co/zR41DhC my put \ud83d\ude44", "created_utc": 1585097974.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/foh5z9/gg_bois_robinhood_diamond_hands_training/", "is_self": true}
