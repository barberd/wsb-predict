{"id": "ffv43g", "title": "Robinhood:. Inflated options pricing?", "selftext": "It looks like the options pricing on Robinhood is about 70-90% higher on RH than other brokers...(I compared to thinkorswim).....  Has anyone else seen this degree of difference with RH before?  I know they typically have wider spreads, and I assumed they were a little more expensive, but 80% just seems nuts.....  Is this just part of how their system is built?   Is it part of their incompetence?  Is it part of how they try to make more money?   Is it just due to the wild volatility we've seen and them having more customers than their infrastructure can handle??  Anyone see any pricing arbitrage opportunities????
