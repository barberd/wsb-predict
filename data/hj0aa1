I wouldn't all-in on this, but maybe invest 5%\\~10% of my portfolio. The calls are still pretty cheap considering that its current valuation is $1b meanwhile its competitors like $NKLA are at least $7b, so I think this can go to $25\\~$30 at least.\n\nAnd there haven't been any historical posts about $WKHS so I feel like people are sleeping on this...\n\n$WKHS 20c 07/17", "created_utc": 1593565153.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hj0aa1/workhorse_wkhs/", "is_self": true}
