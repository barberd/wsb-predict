He asked how much I'd try to be contributing monthly and I said $300 and he kinda chuckled. I told him about my trading experience, and he asked what I did with the money from that and I was just like \"Yeah I cashed out the Robinhood and spent it\" and he quietly repeated me and had a small wheezing kinda laugh\n\n\nHe pointed me towards their investment information and stuff because I sounded clueless about stocks cause I didn't want to admit I just buy stonks and WSB DD. I was like \"oh you know, like, the popular ones, there's still money to be made there ya know\" and he laughed at that one. \n\n\nOverall 10/10 experience was hilarious already glad I chose the Schwab\n\n\nNow let me go text the guy about that scroll saw", "created_utc": 1578088776, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ejmigh/just_had_a_wonderful_phone_call_from_my_first/", "is_self": true}
