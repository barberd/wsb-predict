The word on the street is they are going to beat expectations. Not much of a surprise. Most likely a quick pump tomorrow with not much head room, followed by a drop.\n\nZscaler has had a great run. Earnings were better than expected. The stock blew up over the last few days. Over hyped. Watch for the correction. \n\nZynga. Same thing here. Had a good run. Keep an eye on it.\n\nThese three stocks could run a bit further without correcting but it's unlikely.\n\nZM 155p ZS 90p ZNGA 9.5p", "created_utc": 1591050479.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/guul8s/zoom_zscaler_and_zynga_dont_sleep_on_these/", "is_self": true}
