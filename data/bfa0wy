{"id": "bfa0wy", "title": "Urban Trade Breakdowns: The Rothschilds", "selftext": "Thanks to u/missthecue for the idea.  This is some cool shit, my man.  Thanks for the suggestion.\n\nSo here goes:\n\nMost of you know that America revolted from the British and became an independent country in \u202a1776\u202c.\u00a0 We Americans celebrate this with fireworks and parades and shit.\u00a0 Because, despite our differences, after the American Revolution we generally agree that something resembling a democratic system of government was formed and then for a long-ass time, shit worked itself out under the rules of that system.\n\nBut in France, shit wasn\u2019t quite so democratic after their revolution.  In 1799, it was a little crazy. And into this craziness stepped Napoleon, who seized control of the government and pretty much ran shit for 15 years.\u00a0 Napoleon was a general and generals like to fight battles and seize shit, so Napoleon did just that during his reign, expanding the French empire throughout Europe while vying to stay in control of France.  And all this shit came to a head at the Battle of Waterloo (in what is now Belgium) in 1815.\u00a0\n\nBut what made this battle special in the blur that was thousands of year of Europeans killing each other, was that bankers loaned money to the governments to fight this war.\u00a0 Actually, that\u2019s bullshit.\u00a0 Banks, as we know them, didn\u2019t really exist before all this shit went down.\u00a0 In fact, banks, as we know them, were created as part of this bullshit.\u00a0 And they were pretty much created by one family, the Rothschild\u2019s.\u00a0 And here\u2019s how I think all that shit went down.\n\nThe old man, Mayer Amschel Rothschild, was born in 1744.\u00a0 Everyone was poor as fuck back then, but Mayer was really poor.\u00a0 He lived in a small and crowded flat above the family\u2019s textile shop in the Jewish ghetto of Frankfurt, Germany. \u00a0Mayer\u2019s father was a small time trader of textiles and shit, and being Jewish and generally disdained by his fellow Europeans, he forged in Mayer the belief that family is a fortress and his shit would always be under siege.\u00a0Although Mayer was devoutly committed to his faith, his faith was mixing it up a bit.\u00a0 At the time, Church and State were pretty much the same thing, but as the European economies grew and became more complex, folks started to reinterpret scriptures in light of the expansion of commerce.\u00a0 Specifically, since the days of the flood, it was forbidden to loan money for interest in the Christian and Jewish faiths (it is still technically forbidden in Islam).\u00a0 But that begin to change around this time.\u00a0 And those responsible for such things came to discover some loopholes in the scriptures that made interest fair game, so long as it didn\u2019t delve to the depths of usury (what is now knows as credit card or pay day interest).\u00a0\n\nSo seeing all this, Mayer recognized that he could grow his trading business by extending lines of credit to his customers.\u00a0 And in so doing, he could not only sell more stuff, but collect interest on sales.\u00a0 And fuck, over time, he realized that interest was where the real money was. Get money free and sell it at even a small margin, and that\u2019s all profit.\u00a0 And as he was figuring this out, he started to develop relationships of trust with the local aristocracy, learning from them the business of foreign exchange and leveraging their capital to expand lines of credit and make profits on these investments.\u00a0 This was quite the new hustle at the time.\u00a0\n\nAnd the shit takes off for Mayer, and he becomes a respected member of that whole old-world Euro-thing.\u00a0 But Mayer saw shit for what is was.\u00a0 He would hear his father\u2019s words while he slept at night and he knew these motherfuckers would eventually try kill each other.\u00a0 His money and his family would never be safe kissing rings and shit.\u00a0 So he decided to break with all this old-world bullshit.\u00a0 He decides to step it up and go global.\u00a0 He figured, only by untethering his family from any given Euro-state and dealing in financial instruments outside of the reach of the land-grabbing old-money Euro-emperors could he protect fortress Rothschild.\u00a0 So he set about to distribute his assets, so to speak, and he sent his five sons across Europe - to London, Paris, Frankfurt, Vienna and Naples \u2013 to set up shop trading in interest and bouillon and shit.\nAnd before he sends them off, he breaks the shit down for them in a few simple lessons: 1. All those aristocratic connections, that\u2019s some valuable shit. \u00a0Forge that shit. 2. Keep it global and out of reach of these war-loving peacock euro-generals.\u00a0 3. The interest hustle pays like a motherfucker.\n\nBy the time of Mayer\u2019s death in 1812, Napoleon invades Frankfurt and the Grand Duke of Hesse (Mayer\u2019s primary aristocratic connect and the lord of all that shit) goes into exile.\u00a0 He leaves most of his fortune to Mayer to protect which Mayer transfers to his third son, Nathan, who is finding his stride following the old man\u2019s rules in London.\u00a0\nAnd that brings us back to Waterloo.\n\nAt the time, England hated the fucking French and so they enter into an alliance with Prussia to stop Napoleon from taking over the whole fucking continent.\u00a0 But wars cost shitloads of money and not only that, getting the money and supplies to the troops scattered all over Europe required a complex network of trusted agents and shit to transfer supplies and bullion between traders and sword-makers and field troops and intermediaries.\u00a0 The British had tried and failed to set up just such a network on their own and meanwhile, Napoleon just had France to deal with and France was his bitch.\u00a0 Fuck.\n\nEnter Nathan Rothschild.\u00a0 Rothschild and his brothers had a network and foreign exchange was not a problem for them.\u00a0 And by then, Nathan\u2019s firm in London, NM Rothschild, had developed a robust business lending to foreign governments, so he knew the ropes. And he saw the big picture.  He knew that if he could help at Waterloo, it would move the tide of history, for both his family and England.\n\nSo one night in 1814, Nathan meets with members of the British government and proposes a comprehensive plan to fund the British and the Prussian war effort, involving the foreign currency transfer of English money to troops and suppliers on the continent via the Rothschild network, and a Prussian capital raise through bonds issued in England with interest and principle paid in Sterling at fixed exchange rates to local bondholders. \u00a0Never before had a bank orchestrated the distribution of global capital like this.\u00a0 And lacking a better idea, Nathan got the deal.\n\nWhat happened next is kinda hazy.\u00a0 Napoleon lost at Waterloo. That much we know for sure.\u00a0 So the Rothschild family titled shit historically. They made a fortune off Waterloo and the banking relationships they build with European governments, and became the wealthiest family in the world, creating the modern banking system as we know it.\u00a0 And to this day, they make a really fucking good Bordeaux.\u00a0 Again, this is hard to dispute.\n\nBut there\u2019s this trade\u2026\n\nAs the story goes, Nathan had advance news of the British victory at Waterloo and traded this knowledge on the London Stock Exchange, making profits of historical proportions.\u00a0 If true, this is the mother of all trades.\u00a0 According to some accounts, he had a network of carrier pigeons sent across the English Channel to report the news.\u00a0 Other rumors actually had him physically present at Waterloo during the victory, which I guess presume he had some fast path back to London to trade what he saw before anyone else.\u00a0 And whatever the path of information, there are rumors that he was physically present on the floor that day (which kinda calls into questions the rumors he was at Waterloo), selling like mad into a panicked market, the goal of which was to depress prices before buying like a motherfucker.\u00a0\n\nWell, who the fuck knows.\u00a0 History has an agenda.\u00a0 But as far as I can tell, it\u2019s all bullshit.\u00a0 There are verifiable reports of a Belgian by the name of Ghent, who arrived in England \u202aon June 21st\u202c \u00a0and broke the news before Wellinggton\u2019s messenger. This was reported in several newspapers prior to the official government announcement.\u00a0 As the story goes, Rothschild and other MP\u2019s heard about this early, which, if true, would have  left us with some evidence of the trades.  But check it out yourself,  there is not unusual spikes on either side of the trade on the days prior for the official announcement.  \n\nBut who cared.\u00a0 In a 1929 interview, Nathan Rothschild called Waterloo \u201cThe best business I ever did.\u201d\u00a0 Fuck man, it\u2019s among the best business ever done.\u00a0", "created_utc": 1555748092, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bfa0wy/urban_trade_breakdowns_the_rothschilds/", "is_self": true}
