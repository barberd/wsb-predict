I get that it's Thurs, and it's sell-off day... And I get that they cancelled their conference today due to the state of emergency in California... But regardless, they are killing Intel, and they just won *El Capitan.* They are going to be building a supercomputer for nukes. Plus they got upgraded by an analyst at bank of America (a big fuck you to Wells Fargo). So why the fuck are they plummeting.", "created_utc": 1583429444, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fdypps/amd_wins_600m_contract_great_stock_plummets/", "is_self": true}
