{"id": "g2jxoj", "title": "NUGT", "selftext": "The movements of NUGT x2 ETF roughly follow VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX). However, because NUGT is x2 leveraged and resets everyday it has higher volatility and is mostly meant for day trading. That said, there are periods where NUGT can be swing traded for larger periods of time depending on certain circumstances which I will describe below. First, however, we need to understand the current context of the gold market and how GDX is relevant.\n\nOver the last several months, the gold market has been booming, going from the low 1500/oz  in 11/19 to the 1700/oz today (Fig.1). In mid-late March, gold dropped from these highs all the way back to the 1500 range for a short period before spiking back up rapidly (Fig. 2). This drop was caused by people selling their profitable gold positions to cover margin calls and other losses related to the COVID-19 crash. Simply put, stonks went down, a lot of people lost money, so they sold their gold to quickly recover from the losses. As you can see, gold has already returned to its highs and it will continue to grow. My speculation is that it will reach 2020 by the end of 2020.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fig. 1 - Gold Trend\\/6 Months](https://preview.redd.it/qxez17ils7t41.png?width=948&format=png&auto=webp&s=e046cc6be73bb0932febdab60bb283cfd358408d)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fig. 2 - COVID Effects and Quick Recovery](https://preview.redd.it/6edjc3xes7t41.png?width=922&format=png&auto=webp&s=142508866c647b0b6574e9d2def281dfa59a2197)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, GDX roughly tracks the NYSE Gold Miners Index, which unsurprisingly has a trend which resembles that of actual gold. Gold goes up, gold mining goes up. Look at GDX's portfolio to get a better idea of their investments: [https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/arcx/gdx/portfolio](https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/arcx/gdx/portfolio)\n\nLike anything else, GDX has crashed from the COVID-19 pandemic, and like gold, it recovered very quickly to its previous levels, and is most likely to continue pushing into the territory of all-time highs. This is where things get interesting.\n\nAs I said earlier, NUGT roughly follows GDX, but with much greater short-term volatility. Because of its volatility, NUGT will sometimes reach price points that do not accurately represent the price of GDX. Whenever this happens, i.e., whenever the price difference between NUGT and GDX exceeds roughly 25%, a correction occurs, resulting in a rapid change in NUGT to match GDX. Inherently, NUGT wants to be as close as possible to GDX, but because of its volatile nature, it sometimes goes astray too far, and when this happens, it corrects itself. Below (Fig. 3) I have indicated some of those price points.\n\nToday, NUGT is trading at about $11, but GDX is at about $30. That is about a 60% price difference, far greater than any of the other points indicated. Moreover, GDX is likely to continue rising in suit with gold. Therefore, I believe NUGT is going to experience another correction in the near future that will bring it closer to the $30 range. That is the conclusion that I have reached about its price movement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fig. 3 - GDX and NUGT with Price Points](https://preview.redd.it/21dvqhzzo7t41.png?width=1636&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e03f5249a1e5c08896277912327aeb5251c7439)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for positions in gold, right now I have three: GOLD $35c 9/18 and NUGT $19c 6/19, and NUGT $30 6/19.
