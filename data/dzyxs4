With frozen coming up right before dividend record date theres no way AMC should be sitting at its current level: 7.94. Meaning regular investors not buying calls would get close to a 10% dividend in a year. But I don't want that slow money so calls  it is. As the largest theater chain in the world the next biggest competitor is cinemark which sits at 33.37. But the main DD here is that AMC literally sells tendies for around 10 bucks. That 10 bucks is where amc should be.  \n\n\nEither I make it rich and eat more tendies with their a-lister subscriptions or ban me\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/TvRYpai](https://imgur.com/a/TvRYpai)", "created_utc": 1574416690, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dzyxs4/amc_calls_is_free_tendies/", "is_self": true}
