{"id": "fd6zmi", "title": "The case for JBLU", "selftext": "If you are a fellow bull in bearish times looking for a play, take a flight with me on Jet Blue (this is my first DD go easy on me). They are at a 5 year [low](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/JBLU/) and have always come back up soon from this similar points. Also oil is very cheap, last time it was around this point was a year ago and JBLU was at $17 a share. All carriers have felt a heavy hit with beer virus especially in international flights. Jet Blue is only a domestic carrier. They are oversold and will definitely see a rise soon. They are likely to take a small hit in earnings but their guidance should be strong as coronavirus begins to fade. Personally I have calls for $21 06/19 and plan on buying more around $17 strike for late April tomorrow. They are a strong stock that has beat earnings the last 4 quarters. I would plan to sell before earnings this time and buy the dip. I know you have a choice in airlines, thank you for flying Jet Blue.\n\ntldr: JBLU $20-21 06/19 $17 04/17", "created_utc": 1583293031.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fd6zmi/the_case_for_jblu/", "is_self": true}
