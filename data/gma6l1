DD comes now.\n\nDow closed up 911 points today. 9/11 is confirmed to be an inside job!A)Bush Knocked Down the TowersB)Bush=BuschC)Anheuser-Busch=BUD\n\nThis is how we determined the ticker! Now for the real deep TA!\n\nTo bud or budding means to grow. When people say you are maturing they say you are \"growing UP\".\n\nIn TA terms another word for up is calls. This is where things get really interesting and some people who are new to ~~investing~~ winning may get tripped up so be careful to follow instructions word for word.\n\nStep 1: Market currently ALWAYS does the opposite of what you expect. People have been inversing themselves since the start of the downward descent in their robinhood portfolios. The market is starting to catch on though so it is not as simple as inversing logic!!!!!!!\n\nStep 2: We turn that inverse upside down!! Uppies were bad before and the market tried to trick us into downies but we finally beat the fed.\n\nStep 3: Buy uppies because the market is trying to send an SoS to grab downies!\n\nStep 4: Hit the local Wendy's.\n\n6/5 $45c $BUD.
