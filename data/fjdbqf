I pulled together some key fundamentals below and combed through the most recent earnings release transcripts to understand how COVID-19\u2019s recent impacts on RevPAR (Revenue Per Attended Room) within the Chinese markets can be extrapolated more broadly across Western Europe and the United States. Fortunately, $MAR\u2019s Q4 earnings call was on Feb. 27 and there were loads of analyst questions regarding COVID-19 so there were a few nuggets and anecdotes:\n\n1.RevPAR is a common metric used when evaluating the health of a hotel chain. In 2019, $MAR\u2019s RevPAR index accelerated +200bps which they coined \u201cimpressive\u201d. Fast forward to February 2020 where they noted RevPAR at $MAR hotels in Greater China area declined 90% YoY. At the end of 2019, there were 375 properties across Greater China and as of 2/27, 90 were still closed entirely. In the broader Asia Pacific region excluding Greater China, (\u201cAPEC\u201d), February RevPAR declined 25% YoY.\n\nFebruary RevPAR for the entire Asia Pacific region including Greater China has decreased 50%.\n\nThe scary part: Per Arne ($MAR CEO), \u201c*we estimate roughly $25 million less in fees and EBITDA per month as compared to our 2020 base case*.\u201d The entire Asia Pacific region only represents 16% of $MAR\u2019s global rooms. While China contained the virus by welding apartment doors shut, we\u2019re still running around in our beer goggles tongue-punching bar flies and shouting MAGA while bumping uglies at O\u2019Hare on our way back from the $99 RT flight to Milan (RIP Norwegian). So $25M/month\u2026 for only 16% of the business.  That's $156M/month for the rest of the world which will eat away at $MAR's operating profit and could raise questions about their ability to pay on their massive pile of debt obligations.\n\n2. Unless you live under a rock, you\u2019ve deduced that people aren\u2019t traveling for the NCAA tournament, nor attending any professional sporting events, national conferences, or music festivals (i.e. SXSW). As a result of said shit storm, all hotel conglomerates reneged on their original 2020 guidance\u2026 **except for one: $MAR**. Share prices for Hilton and Hyatt slid 40-60% (since 2/21) with significant drops on the days of their respective announcements. It\u2019s only a matter of days before $MAR pulls their guidance. Once that happens, expect another slide.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lw7cg8knzxm41.png?width=423&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0eec0dbcdff9df27bb5bb7b9dfdf4739a2d73e7\n\n3. Compared to their competitors, $MAR carries a significant amount of long-term debt relative to operating cash flow and their Debt:Equity ratios have negatively and wildly accelerated over the last four quarters while their competitors have remained flat. Look at this madness:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u7fxfivozxm41.png?width=363&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f4d72f4e67adf5af86353d07750bcfdd143bd74\n\n4. To pour more gas on this fire, $MAR\u2019s 2019 YoY cash flow from operating activities actually decreased relative to their competitors during the last two years, begging the question why their stock has performed so well, increasing from $115/share at 12/31/18 to $151/share at 12/31/19 (+31% YoY).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iftzbpi01ym41.png?width=443&format=png&auto=webp&s=af3b60eb52b9e1e2e65f3bfbbb0a146b686cd14e\n\n5. What is $MAR doing with all this debt? Let\u2019s take a look at the share repurchase activity over the last four quarters. In FY19, Marriott repurchased $2.25 billion worth of shares (more than Hilton, Hyatt, and Host combined) thus increasing the value of their share price and providing a perfectly ripe opportunity for insiders to cash out shares before shit really hits the fan.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c6euzlo11ym41.png?width=363&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e01b579184635d8a9427adc7628bd46e4a172d5\n\n6. Open Market insider trading (excluding routine acquisition/disposition) volume in the T6M period is startling. Marriott saw 0 insider shares purchased and 143K shares sold by 9 different members of senior leadership. While the Hyatt number is equally staggering, >90% of the shares sold were done by 1 \u201ccompany\u201d.  Also, 100% of Host\u2019s insider shares sold were by 1 person \u2013 Richard Marriott.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oax635x21ym41.png?width=699&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f2f9d9bd06b77e38147df4846771938983fe103\n\nIn summary, throw down some cash on puts and watch these babies print after $MAR has a colossal dumpster fire of a Q1.\n\nTL;DR - Scroll the fuck up.\n\nSources:\n\n$MAR ER transcript: [https://marriott.gcs-web.com/static-files/6f75cce1-d91e-4afb-95e6-cff47beceb76](https://marriott.gcs-web.com/static-files/6f75cce1-d91e-4afb-95e6-cff47beceb76)", "created_utc": 1584325005.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjdbqf/immunodeficient_marriott_mar_tests_positive_for/", "is_self": true}
