I am now at 80% max credit. \n\nSpx- sold short put side at 95% credit and have the short call side left at delta 7 with 67% max credit achieved. \n\nMy question is, since there are only a few days left, should I hold to expiration to get max credit or exit early and avoid the risk\n\nThanks for the advice\nC", "created_utc": 1557502500, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bmzquw/when_to_exit_profitable_options_nearing_expiration/", "is_self": true}
