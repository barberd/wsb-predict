{"id": "el272c", "title": "Intelligent Intel Incels", "selftext": "Listen up you incels, times have changed. Your fetish with AMD needs to stop. \ud83d\uded1 \u270b Intel is a company that has been around for over 50 YEARS. Most of you little squeakers have not even been alive for 15 years. Their revenue is over 70 billion, PER YEAR. For fucks sake AMD has puny little shitter market cap of less than that. Bob Swan, The Legendary CEO of INTEL, is damn underrated u cucks. Man turned Intel into Disney for christ sake. Shits been going down for years now. Intel\u2019s stock price is currently 59. That\u2019s because Bob fucking Swan is 59. Think about it, if you invest now, you are guaranteed to increase your earnings every time this dude ages. That\u2019s 365 days or 525600 minutes. And guess what, it\u2019s leap year also.  Let me repeat that. Fifty GOD DAMN NINE. AMD\u2019s stock price can\u2019t even get to 50. Sad. Intel is much better look at its chart. \u2197\ufe0f I personally know Lisa Su. She is not 59. AMD is always trying to catch-up to Intel. My final reason why Intel, which also stands for (intelligent), is superior to lame A(advanced)M(micro)D(dicks) is because Bob Swan \ud83e\udda2 could easily beat Lisa Su\ud83e\udd21 is a fight one on one. I myself have been bullied for wearing an AMD shirt to school. Instead of Mary Sue, start saying Lisa Su.", "created_utc": 1578352605, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/el272c/intelligent_intel_incels/", "is_self": true}
