The Strategic Petroleum Reserve that he's going to \"fill right up\"... it's already pretty full and additions to it won't make a dent in the oversupply that is incoming. \n\nThe SPR is a collection of 4 storage sites. \n\nTotal storage capacity= 713.5 Million Barrels \n\nCurrently sitting at 640 Million Barrels (310MB sweet crude/330MB sour crude)\n\nCommodity Trading Houses like Vitol, Mercuria, and Gunvor have way more than 73 Million Barrels stored up in their Terminal Storage Units to \"fill it (the SPR) right up\"... BUT EVEN if they didn't, all of the Majors like Exxon, Chevron and Shell have more than enough stocked in their Terminal Storage Unites to \"fill it right up\".\n\nIf you are still not convinced... the US produces 12MBpd by themselves... so that puts us at 6 days to \"fill it right up\" (assuming all production went to storage).\n\nOil is still bearish until this beervirus kicks rocks and demand comes back.", "created_utc": 1584142976.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fi99a7/oil_info_after_donny_ts_pump/", "is_self": true}
