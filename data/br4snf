{"id": "br4snf", "title": "Fustration for Your Frustration", "selftext": "To help calm the autism while the market is closed, I've created a game. To satisfy the masochist YOLO tendencies, the game simulates the feelings of never being able to win completely. You start with a simple concept, like buying and selling stock for profit. It all sounds so easy, but as you get further, you start to notice things aren't the same as before. You think you have the pattern down, but then the market spikes opposite of your projections. You try again, this time you prevail. Next, you lose again. How could it be that it got even harder? Each time you play, you learn. But no matter how much you learn, you encounter a situation in which you cannot deal with yet. \"One step forward, two steps back.\" Suddenly, you arrive at something unlike anything you've ever seen before. It doesn't follow any of the laws you thought were a universal truth. Trial and tribulations are your only option. To get further, you must lose what you have now. Constantly restarting, you get better at reaching your previous high, but always crash back down. Only after enormous DD, do you start to see previously veiled concepts. Finally, it's time to finish this. With the scars of your past, your grit and dedication shine. You break the barriers of your previous self, the culmination of all of your efforts has finally appeared. At the height of your life, you have achieved the goal you set forth. That is the full experience of this game. Only through overcoming this, will you be able to have your tendies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fustration](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fustration)", "created_utc": 1558405513, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/br4snf/fustration_for_your_frustration/", "is_self": true}
