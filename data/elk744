Loans are typically Long-term (10-30yrs) with a fixed interest rate consisting of monthly payments to be made during the life of the loan. The first few years of payments largely go towards paying the interest while very little go towards paying off loan. \n\n If you have a monthly payment of $2000 a month, $1400 of that would go towards paying interest while only $600 would go towards equity or the actual amount you owe on the loan.  **The interest collected up front is important** in order for these loans to be sold on the secondary market.\n\n* A **MBS** or **mortage backed security** is a packaged pool of individual loans made to mainstreet.  These were typically created by Investment banks who purchase large pools of loans made by smaller banks or mortgage brokers who find people to loan money to.  \n\nSmaller banks such as Washington mutual, Wachovia and mortgage lenders like Countrywide funded loans in which they were sold to and bought by institutions, largest of them Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac who only buy wholesale.\n\n*  **CDO or Collateralized Debt Obligation** generally speaking consists of slices of varying MBS/ABS portfolios then split again and sold as Credit linked notes of varying tiers (tranche) of quality and risks and yields.\n\nThere are many different types of CDOs. The basic and typical vanilla plain CDO is a cashflow CDO where the interest payments on loans flow into.  That $1400 of interest a month goes this direction. There are CDO Squared which are created from varying tranches of other CDOs. There are Synthetic CDOs and Hybrid CDOs consists of cash flow payments from credit default swaps . There are different motivations for investors and banks for the creation of these types of products.  An investor can't just say \"lets go short mortgages\" and \"short sell\" MBS or CDOS.  Instead, in order to short the mortgage market, one must buy insurance or Credit Protection in the form of CDS.  This allows for the buyer to protect or go short while the other side of the transaction allows for an investor to \"go long\" or gain exposure to replicate the performance to securities that are no longer for sale.\n\n* A **CDS or Credit Default Swap** is itself a type of insurance but was widely not used in that fashion.  It is siimilar to a **PUT  Option** in which the buyer must pay the seller a premium but that is where the similarity ends. The understanding is that the seller will collect monthly cash payments for the term of the agreement and in case of a credit event (default) of the underlying security,  the seller of CDS is to make the Buyer whole.  \n\n Unlike buying insurance for a car from a Insurer such as State Farm or Churchill in the UK, CDS are more than often done with zero transparency and accountability since there aren't really any laws to govern such agreements.  Writing or Selling CDS Protection generates cash flow and in the beginning was very lucrative to sell protection.  Many banks and even Insurance companies would sell protection to investors who didn't even own the underlying security that they wanted protection against.  Eventually the quality of loans being made deteriorated and enough loans were defaulting to where credit events were triggered and requiring sellers of CDS to make whole on these agreements with cash.   The great thing about selling CDS was that the seller was not required to keep any capital in reserve in case they needed to payout on any protection they sold.  The use of CDS quickly became a way to pass on risk to another investor or  counter-party.  The ability to transfer risk in this manner created a entirely new market for institutions to create deals that were rated to be so safe giving the illusion of there not being any risk.  \n\nThe more complicated types of securitized products eventually are created and custom tailored or **bespoke** to take a position with a investor.  A IB/Market Maker such as Goldman Sachs is known for being able to create bespoke products.  If a Client wants to buy credit protection (CDS) from GS,  GS would then find a way to offset or hedge their risk to someone else by creating something like a Synthetic CDO but since they do not want to hold all the risk or have it being held on their own balance sheet, they try to find subscribers(other investors) yo fund it by selling CLN or Credit Linked Notes. \n\n* A **Bespoke tranche Opportunity** is  side of a very high leveraged unfunded senior, super senior tranche of a CDO linked to a bespoke portfolio that involves the use of a derivative such as a Credit Default Swap from a single counter-party.\n\nAny derivative is synthetic and is an vehicle created to replicate the performance of something without actually owning the asset it is replicating.  A derivative is also leveraged and provides credit enhancement in the case of structured finance.  It is also important to remember that there are at least two sides to every trade and when it comes to some of these bespoke CDOs, the amount of investors involved are usually 2-3 making it very illiquid. \n\nThey are one-off Bespoke suits custom tailored towards a client's specific needs. \n\n\nThe derivatives market became so large that the value of all the CDS if all hit credit events would roughly equal to $600 trillion dollars in cash needed to make good on these agreements.  To put into perspective, the total value of equities in all 58 major stock exchanges worldwide was worth a total of $62 trillion while the value of the fixed income market (bonds,etc) was around $93 trillion.\n\n Only a black swan type of event would cause these agreements to bust.  Housing values started to flatten and started to decline while the stock market making all time highs. Defaults were triggering some CDS but financial markets were strong and stable, money was cheap to borrow.\n\nThat is, until Greenspan and the FED lit a match and threw it into the fire by reverse-repos which are used to suck up cash from the banking system.  This created a global margin call for all investors leading towards the selloffs in equity markets, CDS triggering further draining the system creating the Black Swan event in 2008 which was really the largest run for cash in history.\n\n\n[Edit: further elaboration of the role of synthetic or derivatives and its effects]", "created_utc": 1578441515, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/elk744/bespoke_tranche_opportunities_and_cdos/", "is_self": true}
