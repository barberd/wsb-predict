This will obviously cause all crops being grown to die.\n\nDead crops = No income\n \nNo income = unpaid debt\n\nUnpaid debt = drop in price shares/bankruptcy. \n\nI also firmly believe the cannabis industry will NOT be bailed out because it isn\u2019t even federally legal. And if it was, there\u2019s 100 more companies that would be bailed out first. \n\n4/17 ACB $.5 puts. \n4/17 MJ ETF $6 puts\n\nBoth of those are still very affordable premiums too.
