Next up is a 30 year IBM Veteran... no thanks.", "selftext": "IBM is a virtual wonderland for a new, young, and aggressive CEO to shake things up and implement new ideas, and execute in modern ways.\n\nTo me, it would be a dream come true to step in as CEO of some of the most intelligent and researched data modeling, AI, machine learning, and pre-cleaned datasets going back into the 50\u2019s.\n\nUnless this old timer is just a blast of fresh fucking renewable air, this is a bad move, and will lead to more puttering along into irrelevance.\n\nThis would be a great time to get in on long term options if they had some fresh blood or someone exciting... but nope.\n\nWhat do y\u2019all think? Bad move by IBM right?", "created_utc": 1580434621, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ewghit/ibm_ceo_stepping_down_today_next_up_is_a_30_year/", "is_self": true}
