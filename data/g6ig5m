{"id": "g6ig5m", "title": "Why it's not hip to be Square ($SQ)", "selftext": "TLDR: 50% of Square's revenue comes from processing in-store transactions for physical merchants.  SQ said transactions volumes for all its merchants were down 25% on March 24th, but estimates from Opentable and other sources suggest things have gotten a lot worse since then.  45% of $SQ's transactions revenue comes from small merchants doing less than $125k in payments through it each year, and as much as 60% of SQ's overall revenues could come from restaurants, retail, and SMB \"services\" (like your wife's boyfriend).  Based on how Germany, China, and Korea have been recovering, small merchants will likely not get their in-store revenues back to normal until Spring 2021.  In spite of all this, the stock has outperformed its peers by 700 bps since late Feb and the S&P by 1900 bps YTD, as management talks up how their Cash App can earn a bunch of money being an intermediary for the JPOW SMB loans and TrumpBuxx.  However, even all that is unlikely to offset what very rough math indicates will be up to 75% of their EBITDA going away for the year.  SQ's next earnings call is May 6th.\n\nWhat is Square?\n\nSquare offers payment services for small businesses through credit card and touchless dongles it gives merchants.  It gets a \\~1% cut after interchange fees for this service.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xoqsabe1uiu41.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ade379c66db8f8151a62073493b9bd1e58d992c0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2egrs3e1uiu41.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=028f59cbc6d2bd116b9de7460de631d5c6883e76\n\nIn case you're wondering, you have to be in a store to pay via these pieces of injection-molded art.\n\nThey also offer a cash app and working capital loans to the small businesses they've signed up.\n\nWho uses Square?\n\nThis guy, and people like him:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1e6qicb3uiu41.png?width=664&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d2a517496990c482df89074babe961cd05e42d2\n\nMeet Chef Romeo of Romeo Chocolates in Long Beach, California.  When he's not busy making artisanal chocolate, he's getting his photo slapped onto page one of Square's 2019 Annual Report.\n\nAre they still using Square?\n\nNo. Square claims they have an ecommerce api like Paypal or Stripe / Shopify, but adoption is low.  Case in point, Romeo Chocolates:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pv1xzed5uiu41.png?width=1244&format=png&auto=webp&s=5da72090929860a1e4277b0f1f34830e4ed1c664\n\nIn these times of woe, Chef Romeo prefers you place your orders online.  For those orders, who helps process the payments? Google. Paypal. Shopify. Not Square.\n\nHow bad does it get?\n\nVery bad. 50% of SQ's revenue comes from transaction payment processing (fees from Gross Payment Volume, or GPV); 45% of that comes from merchants who make less than 125k in payments volume through the platform and another 27% comes from merchants who make less than 500k in payments volume through the platform. Assuming half these smaller merchants are going to be doing minimal in-store business for the next 2 quarters, and most of these merchants will no longer use the SW services Square offers... you're looking at up to $350M of EBITDA impact, possibly more.  Square's FY20E was \\~$500M, so this is a \\~80% impact.\n\nWhy is SQ up?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xp9lqx97uiu41.png?width=1562&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd1b260f2b93d746b46650461ec9fbfd73159cdb\n\nFor some reason, investors are confusing SQ's customer base with those of First Data/Fiserv, Elavon, Paypal, and Adyen.  Those companies are not the same as Square.  Their merchants are not hip.  No, those merchants (ie Costco) are sell uncool but wildly profitable things like toilet paper and bottled water.  In the COVIDian Maslow hierarchy, Costco beats sub-125k GPV merchants like Romeo Chocolates.  And over 60% of Squares customers are small retailers and restaurants.  Not exactly COVID proof.\n\nWhen is the shoe going to drop?\n\nMay 6th is when Square releases earnings.  Investors will be looking for good vibes from the TrumpBuxx and JPOW SMB loans but all they will see - in the numbers - is a cavalcade of destruction.  I for one will enjoy watching management defend TEV/Forward Ebitda at 75x when Forward EBITDA is projected to drop 80% this year.\n\nThis is what Opentable says around half of Square's customer base has become:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/klyr6nwytiu41.png?width=1822&format=png&auto=webp&s=020b22c42189bd991a51dfe89301ccbcc6cfb080\n\nDoes this look like something worth 11x revenue to you?\n\nPositions: 5/08 and 5/15 puts at $43", "created_utc": 1587627544.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6ig5m/why_its_not_hip_to_be_square_sq/", "is_self": true}
