There is not much time left for this strategy to\nboost your portfolio by hundreds of millions!!!! \nOk so elon is having a baby with grimes and it seems as if she is around 6~ months pregnant. This gives us about less than 3 months to complete the strategy. So first we spend all our life savings in $TSLA 600 1/21 calls and we continue to kermit suy slide!! Yes kermit will be helping us. Ok guys i know this is risky but we have a chance at this. When we are in heaven we skip the reborn lines and sneak into the ones due for 3 months from now. The more retards we have the more chances!! Elon won\u2019t mind to have an autistic son so we\u2019re good!!! Now, the riskiness here is to get it right and be reborn as Elon\u2019s child. There\u2019s low chances but if you\u2019re an autistic bear you might as well take these chances because they\u2019re better than SPY puts. Thoughts??? Any improvements to my idea?? \nWE DONT HAVE MUCH TIME LEFT\nTHIS WILL INCREASE YOUR PORTFOLIO BY 10000% GUARANTEED!!!", "created_utc": 1578673081, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/emt5bi/insane_tendies_with_tsla_strategy/", "is_self": true}
