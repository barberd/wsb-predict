{"id": "f6e55h", "title": "Zillow Group Inc - 2/19/2020 AMC", "selftext": "**Stock: Zillow Group (Z), Also ZG, but we're using Z for better liquidity.**\n\n**Direction:** **Neutral Bullish**\n\n**Price Target:** **55$**\n\n**Type:** Put Credit Spread\n\n**Fundamental:** Zillow has been following the footsteps of RDFN and the earlier homebuilders of Lennar, KBH and others. This sector tailwind has boosted Zillow\u2019s price nearly 2X in the span of less than 6 month. Zillow\u2019s home flipping segment, while generating additional losses, has completely revitalized the revenue growth story. However, a concern is the revenue recognition method, which calculates the wholly flipped house sold price as revenue, rather than the incremental cash earned. Fishy, but not that fishy, as a secondary margin KPI tracker can be used to supplement this revenue methodology.\n\n**Technical**: Priced above in 20, 50, 200 day moving averages.  MACD shows bearish divergence. RSI shows around 75, overbought. Options sentiments are very bullish in volume and in open interest. Implied movement of about 11.8% or 6.50$.\n\n**Sentimental**: Redfin recently spiked off a very strong earnings with narrower losses and increased revenue. The stock shot up even after a strong quarter of price growth. Zillow here is expected to follow the same pattern, with potential to short squeeze due to 15% short float. The downside would be missing expectation and lower guidance, though I doubt management will let that narrative happen. December was very strong overall for the home industry and Zillow should follow suit. \n\n**ROI: 25%**\n\n**Risk Level: 3 out of 5, Risky**\n\nSell 2/28 50$ Put  \nBuy 2/28 48$ Put\n\n[Robinhood SS](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/678294460425306197/679741840064643083/image0.png)", "created_utc": 1582133712, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6e55h/zillow_group_inc_2192020_amc/", "is_self": true}
