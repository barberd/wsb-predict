APT saved my account through the crash, kept it alive as my other stocks got destroyed.   Yes, I'm not as retarded as all of you yet and I do buy shares and trade them for profits.  Maybe one day I'll bet options and bring my account to -20K.  No DD other than they make facemasks and that's all I see on the news.  It works for me, but you fuckers are all going to space with Richard Branson so y'all probably dont care about capitalizing on the virus.", "created_utc": 1580278067, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/evivqe/who_has_been_enjoying_apt/", "is_self": true}
