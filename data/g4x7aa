But this one seemed to be WSB material, so I'm sharing.\n\nThere is a good description here:[https://www.realvision.com/opportunity-in-the-covid-crude-oil-contango](https://www.realvision.com/opportunity-in-the-covid-crude-oil-contango). Harris  Kupperman (hkuppy on twitter) talks it up a lot, but I'm believing. If  you search, you'll find many others talking about it.Summary- Oil demand is way down, and will be for a while\n\n\\- No matter what they say and how hard they try, oil producers will not be able to cut production fast enough\n\n\\- Land side storage is filling up fast- Even if there is storage, if it's not at the point of production, it needs a pipeline or a tanker.-  Oil futures are in deep contango. Buying and storing oil and shorting  futures is risk-free, if you can store the oil at the right price.\n\n\\- As result of the above, tanker charter rates are outrageously high right now.\n\n\\- At these rates, tanker companies can earn their market cap each quarter!\n\n\\-  When this happened in \\~2003/04, companies like Frontline went up 20-50x  in less than two years (before they slowly burnt it down again). Look  at the charts. I'm already in for about $40.5k in equity and $2.5k in OTM call options. This trade is really starting to  move so I would not wait too long. Most of the big names have earnings  reports in May.I hold shares in DHT, FRO, NAT, STNG, TNK, EURN and call options in DHT, FRO and NAT.\n\nEdit to add a couple of notes:\n\n\\- These names are pretty volatile. Don't get scared and tap out on a down day\n\n\\- The deep OTM options spreads are very wide. You MUST fish inside the spread with a limit order to get a good price. I have been getting filled near the mid-point of the spread almost every time. Do NOT lift the offer!\n\nEven if you are not too sure, why not by an OTM call (or ten) for $25?! So check your PRT, then kill your FOMO with a YOLO!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck,\n\nspreadlegswide, Certified Options Autist (COA)", "created_utc": 1587403881.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4x7aa/tanker_trade/", "is_self": true}
