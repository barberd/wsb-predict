{"id": "bxsjw4", "title": "My 3 biggest takeaways from the $BYND conf call", "selftext": "* 2019 revenue of at least $210m (up 140% YoY). This was higher than consensus of $205m but more importantly, it seems like this GUIDANCE IS CONSERVATIVE because A) they view it as a \"floor\" (i.e. sales likely to be higher than this); and, B) they only include post-trial partnerships with QSRs (quick-serve restaurants). An analyst asked them to elaborate on this and if it includes the recent announcement with Tim Hortons and they said NO because Tim Hortons announcement was a trial. So if successful and Tim Hortons goes ahead with a full launch with BYND, then that's ADDITIONAL revenue to their 2019 guidance. Summary: 2019 sales growth is going to be higher than 140%.\n* Operating leverage is insane. YoY revenues up 215% but gross profits increased 424%. Put another way, gross profit margins increased from 16% to 27%. Summary: higher sales growth in the future is going to translate into even bigger profit growth.\n* They confirmed that they are talking to multiple big QSRs (hmmm McDonalds one of them???) and more importantly, that they definitely have the production capacity to meet a big win. Summary: capacity constraints are not an issue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy two-point thesis to those who have seen my previous posts is that BYND is a short-term buy (up until end of October when the 180 IPO lock-up expires) on 1) potential big QSR win (market speculation is that it'll be MCD) which will cause the stock to pop; 2) point 1 pop leads to a massive short squeeze (more than half the float is shorted) leading to a secondary pop.", "created_utc": 1559899931, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bxsjw4/my_3_biggest_takeaways_from_the_bynd_conf_call/", "is_self": true}
