Details inside.", "selftext": "So BYND has a deal with Tim Horton\u2019s in Canada where they are selling beyond burgers and beyond breakfast samwhich\u2019s. I tried one and personally, I think it tastes awful. I asked the till manager at 2 different locations about how the beyond products are selling and if they are any good. Both times they told me that they get a certain allotment every  morning and by 2-3pm they are completely sold out of beyond products.\n\nI thought that was insane, but bynd\u2019s upcoming earnings will be even more insane. \n\n** Not financial advice.", "created_utc": 1563809474, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cgeo7n/a_poor_mans_bynd_dd_details_inside/", "is_self": true}
