Nothing was working on TD Ameritrade. Not on the app and not on the website. Was it because of too much volume? I am royally screwed this blood monday. (Not that I have much more to lose on the calls). Was stressing out and didn't have enough time to buy my weekend puts either. Today royally sucked. Never going to be a bull and buy calls again. FULL GAY BEAR from here on out. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kyio3s5swvn41.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0099af847aa80b78ff5e70a26af3460c40d130e6", "created_utc": 1584734844.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fm1r5f/spy_options_werent_working_on_td_ameritrade/", "is_self": true}
