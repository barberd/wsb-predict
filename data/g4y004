They usually hold 100% of their funds in WTI futures for the following month.  They hold these and then begin to sell/roll them into the following months futures contract starting 2 weeks before the strike date.  For example they sold all of their May 2020  futures between april 7th-13th and then rolled those into June 2020 futures. http://www.uscfinvestments.com/resources-filings/commodities/uso\n\nThis means that USO spent nearly $26-30 to buy June futures contracts. These contracts are selling for around $22 today 4/20.  Once the May contract is up tomorrow this is where everyone will begin speculating.
