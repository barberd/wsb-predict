We need someone from WallStreetBets to guest host this program and show boomers what Fast Money is all about. \n\n\"Risk at least 50% of your net worth on TQQQ weekly puts\"\n\n\"Buy Spy 150 Puts\"\n\n\"I'd suck dick for a Disney put right now\"", "created_utc": 1584047765.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhnrzj/cnbcs_fast_money_program/", "is_self": true}
