{"id": "bpdldq", "title": "Long Naspers, Short Tencent for \"Risk-free\" gains", "selftext": "Most of you have heard of Tencent (TCEHY) but probably not Naspers (NPSNY). Naspers is not well known and appears to be significantly mispriced. I (and many others) think there is a truly \"risk-free\" play here. I put that in quotes because you shouldn't take my word at face value. I'm just some guy on reddit. Do some DD of your own. Or don't. It's your money - I'm just hoping to shine some light on how to turn it into more money.\n\nThe case for Naspers is as follows: \n\n* Naspers (NPSNY) is basically a VC of sorts, based out of South Africa\n* They invest primarily in tech and have stakes in a lot of [companies](https://www.naspers.com/companies)\n* Their biggest and most important stake is in Tencent. They own 31.2% of Tencent.\n* Tencent market cap at this time is $450B making the value of Naspers holdings worth around $140B\n* Naspers market cap is only $100B. Based on the Tencent holding alone, they are trading at a $40B discount.\n* Naspers also has large stakes in a couple dozen other tech companies that are fairly well known, such as [mail.ru](https://mail.ru). So unless these holdings are collectively worth less than $0 (spoiler: they aren't), there's no good reason for this discount. \n\nYou could just stop reading here and long Naspers, and that would be a good play. \n\nBut I think the better play is to bet that the discount between Naspers market cap and their Tencent holding will eventually close. And so the \"risk-free\" play is as follows:\n\n* Long NPSNY\n* Short TCEHY\n\nAs the gap in valuation closes, you should profit on both sides. The only risk to you is if the gap widens. There's no real reason the gap should widen but this is current year and I've seen crazier things happen.", "created_utc": 1558018765, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bpdldq/long_naspers_short_tencent_for_riskfree_gains/", "is_self": true}
