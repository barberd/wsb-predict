{"id": "fs7sdh", "title": "Why stonks are up. Another theory.", "selftext": "So, I just thought of another reason why markets might be going up right now  and it consistes of 2 parts:\n\n\\- Wage cuts\n\n\\- Lay-offs\n\nDonald and The Fed (DTF) are giving major corporations a bunch of money in order for them to not die. When we heard all this, we figured \"that ain't a good sign\" and bought puts. One of the demands from DTF is \"no buy backs, dividend or bonuses until it's paid back\", or something along those lines. Yet again, we thought that's not good, so we got more puts. The, here, problem is that we don't think like the sadistic bull chads of Wall Street.\n\nWall Street chads are seeing major long term upside to this, because in order to pay the loans back as soon as possible, companies will resort to cutting cost. Two great ways to cut cost are: getting rid of people and paying the remaining ones less. The lawless chaos that is caused by this virus gives these companies the opportunity to do both. They can just not rehire the ones that they wanted to get rid of anyway, but this time without severance or legal repercussions, because there is no law right now, Also, when they do rehire, they will explain they're having to cut wages in order to stay afloat and they will spew some bull-shit about loyalty and getting through this together.\n\nWhen all of this is done, these companies will work as hard as they can to pay back those loans ASAP. They can't even hand out bonuses, so that helps too. Once the loans are paid back, the limitations will be gone and then everyone (who owns stock) will be happy. Dividends will be paid out again and will be higher due to lower overhead, management will get massive bonuses because they handled everything so well and got the company through the downturn and stocks will moon because of all this,\n\nMeanwhile we're all just fucked because our puts expired worthless or we got fired or a pay cut. But at least the stonks are up, right?", "created_utc": 1585635669.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fs7sdh/why_stonks_are_up_another_theory/", "is_self": true}
