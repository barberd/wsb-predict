If you intend to hold through downswings to catch the upswing, sell your losses and put that money in a put you value equally.\n\nIn choppy waters like these, the whole market moves as a unit. If you sell a loser you lock in those losses for tax purposes. That means they will offset any gains elsewhere as long as you don't reinvest in the same (or equivalent) stock or option.\n\nSo a badly timed CCL put could get dropped and transferred to RCL. Assuming they go down roughly equally, you would make the same profit but would write off your losses on CCL.", "created_utc": 1584125591.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fi4osj/tax_loss_harvesting_people/", "is_self": true}
