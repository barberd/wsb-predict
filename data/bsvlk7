Good morning and happy Saturday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new holiday-shortened trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 27th, 2019.\n\n# **Trade and the economy have become the new roller coaster for markets  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/24/trade-and-the-economy-have-become-the-new-roller-coaster-for-markets.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Trade headlines could be a big factor for markets in the week ahead, but investors will also be attuned to fresh inflation data and moves in the bond market, which is flashing new worries about the economy.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were on a roller coaster ride in the past week, as markets reacted to worsening trade tensions and concerns that negotiations could be prolonged, causing pain for the global economy. But the bond market\u2019s move was perhaps even more dramatic, as yields, which move opposite of price, fell to levels last seen in 2017, and the futures market began to price in three Fed interest rate cuts by the end of next year.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of economic data next week, so events hang over us,\u201d said Marc Chandler, chief global strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. \u201cIt\u2019s more about the evolution of old issues than new issues, like trade and Brexit.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Brexit will continue to be a focus in global markets. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May stepped aside Friday after failing to get agreement on a plan for the U.K. to leave the European Union. Chandler said investors will be watching the jockeying among candidates hoping to succeed Prime Minister May, with hard line Brexit proponent Boris Johnson expected to seek the job, among others.\n*****\n&gt; As for trade, Chandler said it\u2019s possible that President Donald Trump\u2019s comments that Huawei could be part of a trade deal may be the start of a new approach by the administration to tone down its rhetoric. The telecom giant has been blacklisted by the U.S. and is expected to be denied access to U.S. components for its equipment.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn some ways, it\u2019s a headline problem. We think of it more as event risk,\u201d said Nadine Terman, CEO and CIO at Solstein Capital. \u201cChina thinks in dynasties and U.S. investors seem to think in durations of days and months, so I think we are misunderstanding the duration of their negotiating strategy.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; She said the issues between the two countries go way beyond trade and extend to China\u2019s military aspirations in the South China Sea and its global campaign of influence through the Belt and Road initiative, Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s signature program.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s now become more nationalistic, emotional, to say: \u2018We\u2019re going against the U.S. and we\u2019ve got to be in it for the long haul.\u2019 I don\u2019t think you have the same emotion here in the U.S. You don\u2019t have the same nationalistic pride to say \u2018we have to fight China at all cost,\u2019\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, Wall Street increasingly began to expect the Trump administration to turn up the pressure on China with another wave of 25% tariffs on the $300 billion or so in goods remaining that have no tariffs. Those tariffs would directly hit American consumer goods and are expected to take a bigger bite out of the economy.\n*****\n&gt; Fears of a trade war hurting global growth and concerns that the U.S. is already beginning to weaken were evident in the bond market. Treasury yields reflected lowered growth expectations. The 10-year hit a low of 2.29% on Thursday and was at 2.32% Friday.\n*****\n&gt; J.P. Morgan economists Friday downgraded their view of the economy, slicing second quarter growth to just 1% from an earlier forecast of 2.25% and first quarter growth of 3.2%. The economists blamed weak U.S. manufacturing data and said risks were signs of weakness in the global economy and also indications that the trade war was hurting business sentiment.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThe concerns the markets have right now are that we\u2019re moving towards a worst case scenario, and that could persist for quite some time,\u201d said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short rate strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then the market is believing economic data, and the Fed will likely need to respond to that by trying to offset and prevent a recession.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; The most important data point in the coming week will be Friday\u2019s personal consumption expenditures, which includes the PCE deflator inflation data that the Fed monitors. It was at 1.6% year-over-year last month, and is expected to be the same for April, well below the Fed\u2019s target of 2% inflation.\n*****\n&gt; Inflation has become a key focus on Wall Street, particularly after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said low inflation appears to be transitory and not enough of a concern to make the Fed cut interest rates. Powell and other Fed officials have stressed the Fed is pausing in its rate hiking cycle, is monitoring the economy and does not yet know which way it will move next.\n*****\n&gt; Solstein Capital\u2019s Terman said she is watching the PCE inflation report to see if it confirms her view that inflation and the economy will be weaker this summer.\n*****\n&gt; She also expects the markets to be choppy, and by late summer, around its annual Jackson Hole symposium, the Fed could indicate it could cut interest rates.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cPeople are going to start getting even more concerned this summer about the U.S.,\u201d Terman said.\n*****\n&gt; Terman said she has been positioned for lower inflation and slower GDP growth with key holdings in utilities, REITs, Treasurys and gold.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWhat would do well this summer? Staples, utilities, health care, REITs. You want fixed income. You want to be underweight tech, energy, financials and industrials,\u201d she said.\n*****\n&gt; There is also home prices data Tuesday and advanced economic indicators Thursday. That comes in addition to a few earnings reports, including Costco, Ulta Beauty and Dollar General.\n*****\n&gt; Markets will also be watching the outcome of European parliamentary elections, and if there is a strong showing by populists, there could be a negative impact on the euro and risk assets.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/YB7FVVl.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/tsse5wM.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/Jx099zV.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/Noafctx.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mDkvHkf.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FLUiLS1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/7bYwEj2.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SiGqWZH.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/L2rlfZK.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FNFloqg.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qhHZ79X.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Down Four Straight Day After Memorial Day\n\n&gt; Our office will be closed for observance of Memorial Day on Monday, May 27. U.S stock and bond markets will also be closed. As you spend some quality time off with family and friends please take time to commemorate those who have paid the ultimate price while serving in the U.S. military.\n\n&gt; For decades the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac has been tracking and monitoring the market\u2019s performance around holidays. The trading day after Memorial Day has a mixed record going back to 1971. Both S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have declined more often than risen on the day, but average performance is still positive. Since 1986, the frequency of gains has improved, and average performance has also risen however, over the last four years S&amp;P 500 has declined. The second trading day after Memorial Day has since more advances than declines, but average performance is negative for NASDAQ. The third day after appears to have the best long- and short-term record combined with solid average performance.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e49bc44dc78f0206988b762ef5ea68ad/tumblr_inline_ps0eqveTDc1spdppr_640.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Bespoke Report - It's All Relative\n\n&gt; Hut, Hut, Cut! With weaker economic data to contend with this week on both a domestic and international basis, plus escalating tensions between the US and China, investors are increasingly pricing in a higher likelihood of rate cuts from the FOMC before the year is out. Through mid-day Friday, the Fed Fund futures market was pricing in over an 85% chance of a rate cut between now and the January 2020 meeting. Those are the kind of odds that would make James Holzhauer say \"All in.\"\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/rate-odds.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Fed Members Side With \u201cTransitory\u201d Inflation\n\n&gt; Investors just got more details on Federal Reserve (Fed) policymakers\u2019 views of inflation.\n\n&gt; Minutes of the Fed\u2019s most recent meeting, which ended May 1, showed that \u201cmany participants\u201d considered slowing consumer inflation as \u201ctransitory,\u201d and agreed that the Fed\u2019s current patient approach should help stoke economic growth and inflation. Policymakers\u2019 optimistic view on inflation runs counter to a growing opinion in financial markets that slowing growth in core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) could warrant lower rates.\n\n&gt; Markets think the grace period for a \u201ctransitory\u201d excuse has passed, but data show it\u2019s too soon to tell. Another measure of inflation, the Fed Bank of Dallas\u2019s \u201ctrimmed mean\u201d PCE measure, points to higher pricing pressures ahead. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the trimmed mean PCE, which has proven to be a less volatile version of core PCE, has hit 2% year-over-year growth for the past several months.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Slowing-Core-PCE-Due-Transitory-Factors.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s tough to make a case for lower rates with over 3% gross domestic product growth, healthy wage growth, and a labor market close to full employment,\u201d said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cIf consumer inflation picks up, the U.S. economy will be near full employment with healthy inflation across the board, fulfilling the Fed\u2019s dual mandate.\u201d\n\n&gt; Of course, much has happened on the global front since the Fed\u2019s last meeting. Trade tensions have flared up again, with the United States raising tariff rates on $200 billion of Chinese imports and threatening to increase rates on the remaining swath of goods. Logically, tariffs should be a catalyst for higher consumer inflation, as higher costs should boost price growth. However, the opposite has happened over the past few months, and there are several factors to consider when thinking about future inflation.\n\n&gt; Overall, we don\u2019t see a strong argument for a rate cut right now, and we side with the Fed in thinking consumer inflation could pick up as wage growth accelerates and growth stabilizes. At the very least, it\u2019s becoming more obvious the Fed doesn\u2019t have enough clarity to move policy in either direction.\n\n*****\n\n# Another Reason For Bulls To Smile\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index has officially gained each of the first four months of the year for the first time since 2013. This comes on the heels of the best first quarter since 1998. Six straight months in green has been the best monthly win streak to start a year, and that last happened in 1996.\n\n&gt; Starting a year with strength like this historically has been a good sign, even though stocks in May saw a nearly 5% correction.\n\n&gt; \u201cAlthough we wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see continued volatility over the coming months, the good news is a great start to a year has had a funny way of eventually resolving higher,\u201d explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIn fact, the rest of the year has been higher an incredible 14 out of 15 times after the first four months were in the green!\u201d\n\n&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&amp;P 500 returns the rest of the year (final 8 months) have been more than twice as strong as the average year returns\u201410% versus 4.7%\u2014following four straight monthly gains to kick off a new year. There\u2019s always a catch though, and in this case we\u2019ve seen an average pullback of more than 8% the rest of the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/A-Strong-Start-To-A-Year-Has-Bulls-Smiling.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Earnings Season Takeaways\n\n&gt; We consider earnings season a success based on the amount of upside to prior estimates generated by S&amp;P 500 Index companies despite several headwinds. Companies handily beat expectations to get first quarter earnings up to flat, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Looks-like-we%E2%80%99ll-avert-an-Earnings-recession.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; When earnings season began in mid-April, consensus estimates called for a 4\u20135% drop in S&amp;P 500 earnings, according to FactSet data. Beating results by this much is impressive considering persistent trade uncertainty and the drag on overseas profits from a strong U.S. dollar. Also consider that the median stock in the S&amp;P 500 has grown earnings several percentage points faster because a few large companies are dragging down the market-cap-weighted calculation.\n\n&gt; Resilient estimates are also encouraging. Since April 15, the 2019 consensus estimate for S&amp;P 500 earnings per share has risen slightly to $168 (a 4% year-over-year increase). We consider that a win given that estimates typically fall during earnings season.\n\n&gt; \u201cEscalating trade uncertainty and the threat of more tariffs are huge wild cards for corporate profits,\u201d said LPL Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cWe are hopeful that significant progress can be made on the trade front next month, when President Trump and China\u2019s President Xi are expected to meet at the G20 summit. A prolonged impasse that lasts through the summer would make mid-single-digit earnings growth difficult to achieve in 2019.\u201d\n\n&gt; Our base case remains that we will get a trade deal with China early this summer and consensus expectations for 3\u20134% earnings growth may prove to be conservative. Earnings are hardly booming, but with a continued economic expansion, low inflation, and low interest rates, we see enough earnings growth ahead to push stocks up to our year-end S&amp;P 500 fair value target of 3,000\u2014though it probably won\u2019t get there in a straight line.\n\n*****\n\n# Pre-election Year June: Tech and Small-caps Best\n\n&gt; June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 48 years as a rule ranking eighth with a 0.6% average gain, up 26 of 48 years. This contributes to NASDAQ\u2019s \u201cBest Eight Months\u201d which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking tenth, but essentially flat (\u20130.02% average). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.6% in the month since 1979.\n\n&gt; In pre-election years since 1950, June ranks no better than mid-pack. June is the #8 DJIA month in pre-election years averaging a 0.8% gain with a record of nine advances in seventeen years. For S&amp;P 500, June is #5 with an average gain of 1.2% (10-7 record). Pre-election year June ranks #6 for NASDAQ and #7 for Russell 2000 with average gains of 1.9% and 1.1% respectively. Recent pre-election year Junes in 2015, 2011 and 2007 were troublesome for the market as DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ all declined (Russell 2000 eked out a modest gain in 2015).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/57d94e8a408ad305588ab0473f6f28ec/tumblr_inline_prz1z7mpgq1spdppr_400.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for May 24th, 2019** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VglIB3aJTjA))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 05.26.19** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0SBMubBDW0))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NIO** \n&gt; * **$MOMO** \n&gt; * **$GOOS** \n&gt; * **$COST** \n&gt; * **$PANW** \n&gt; * **$ZS** \n&gt; * **$OKTA** \n&gt; * **$WDAY** \n&gt; * **$NTNX** \n&gt; * **$ULTA** \n&gt; * **$DKS** \n&gt; * **$VEEV** \n&gt; * **$ANF** \n&gt; * **$BZUN** \n&gt; * **$DG** \n&gt; * **$DLTR** \n&gt; * **$BNS** \n&gt; * **$YY** \n&gt; * **$MRVL** \n&gt; * **$ASND** \n&gt; * **$CSIQ** \n&gt; * **$CPRI** \n&gt; * **$BAH** \n&gt; * **$BURL** \n&gt; * **$VMW** \n&gt; * **$AMWD** \n&gt; * **$KEYS** \n&gt; * **$ZUO** \n&gt; * **$BMO** \n&gt; * **$PLAN** \n&gt; * **$JT** \n&gt; * **$HEI** \n&gt; * **$GPS** \n&gt; * **$NXGN** \n&gt; * **$PVH** \n&gt; * **$QTNT** \n&gt; * **$NM** \n&gt; * **$EXPR** \n&gt; * **$SAFM** \n&gt; * **$BITA** \n&gt; * **$CMCO**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/L2rlfZK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/TW37RkL.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/9gVUm6y.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 5.27.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.
