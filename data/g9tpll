{"id": "g9tpll", "title": "401k 2 Day Settlement Dumb Question", "selftext": "Any time I close a trade in my 401k I have to wait till the day after next to use those funds. So if I close out a $10,000 position on Monday, that $10,000 won't be available for another trade till Wednesday. In my generic TDA account I can use funds immediately after closing a trade.\n\nThis results in me having to be ok with gains on my total account value of a fraction of a percent per day. This is ok since it's 6 figures (I'm 38, so this is not slightly exceptional). 0.2% per day(Can't trade options in 401k) in a tax deferred account adds up to 7.3x in 4 years, so that's ok and I could semi-retire then. But it also means I end up holding a small gain which turns into a loss, because I know I have to wait 2 days to use money again so I hold out to try for a larger gain. That is less of a problem since I have started more aggressively using stops. But maybe then I didn't make that much so I want to get back in again for another trade. But instead those funds are stuck.\n\nIs there any way to convert a Schwab 401k to a different account so I can trade CONSTANTLY?", "created_utc": 1588101968.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9tpll/401k_2_day_settlement_dumb_question/", "is_self": true}
