I need your expert opinions.", "selftext": "Ok, between you and me, I'm almost technically retarded. Got papers from a doctor from when I was a kid saying I'm like 1 point away from being full-blown. I wasn't really paying attention when they gave me that test though because I was thinking about Pokemon and DBZ and had no idea what I was supposed to do -- so could have been a fluke.\n\nNow that we have that out of the way, I've only ever traded options once before and blew up my account spectacularly. It still hurts.\n\nI had about $1,000 left. Saw all you autists saying MFST and SPCE are printing tendies the past few days. I see my opportunity to win back all my losses and my loved ones will never know the money was ever lost in the first place. Genius, right? So I go all in today.\n\nHere are my calls:\n\n$30 SPCE Call 1/15/2021 - I paid $380 for the contracts at $3.80 per share.\n\n$240 MSFT Call 1/15/2021- I paid $820 for the contracts at $4.10 per share.\n\nI went long calls this time (2021) because I got screwed last time on 2 week calls. I hear some Greek named theta might have some words with me later if I hold onto these a long time, but I'll cross that bridge when I get to it.\n\nAlso, something about IV being high right now and yada yada.\n\nTo those more vaccinated than me, have I made a horrible mistake, or will I rise from the ashes like an autistic phoenix?", "created_utc": 1581455132, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f2f0sg/went_all_in_on_msft_and_spce_calls_today_did_i/", "is_self": true}
