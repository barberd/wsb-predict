But shorting this pig is tastier.\n\n$3B market cap close to all time high, for about 1500 franchise locations. Do the math. That's $2M \\*per franchise location\\*. LOL. They're making a paltry $20M/year so P/E is stratospheric at around 150. Looking at their books, negative stockholder's equity of $210M. Still paying execs millions. They claim 10% growth annually, which is nice, but who gives a shit? They need 100% growth annually for years to justify this price.\n\nOption volume is too low, so short this shit on margin.\n\nPosition or ban:  short 1000 WING shares", "created_utc": 1586962032.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1tb2o/wing_is_hilariously_overvalued/", "is_self": true}
