I hope you're all enjoying a Friday night of looking back in shame on the mistakes you made this week. You know, if you'd just \\[\\*insert less autistic play here\\*\\], you might have been able to afford that Switch Lite to noodle on next time you're shitting out last night's Hot Pockets. Tom Nook won't take himself down, you know (u/pokimane, maybe a challenge for the stream).\n\nAnyway, here is something fun I thought we'd try during quarantine - a WSBook Club. We'll all read one of the books in the poll below, and I'll host a live chat about a month from now where we can roast each other for how little we took out of it. Nothing technical - because those books are for nerds and JV traders - but they're all going to be market-centric. \n\nNow, I know that deciphering squiggles you don't find on your RH app can be a struggle for many of you, but I'm confident that if you furrow your brow real hard, you might be able to make it all the way through. There's always the movie version if you can't handle the strain.\n\nVote in the poll below, or suggest an alternative option in the comments. If it's upvoted enough, we'll read that. Voting closes Sunday night.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/g7jz2f)", "created_utc": 1587774305.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7jz2f/wsbooks_vol_1_a_book_club_for_autists_who_cant/", "is_self": true}
