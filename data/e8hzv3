{"id": "e8hzv3", "title": "Total Return Swap transaction used by activist", "selftext": "Hi all- I was wondering if someone can assist me in understanding this particular transaction executed by Engaged Capital for Medifast (NYSE: MED). The hedge fund recently filed a 13D filing in the stock using a combination of purchases of the common stock and a swap. I know swaps are OTC, but was wondering why purchase a \u2018Cash-Settled Total Return Swap\u2019 and immediately sell shares, is it because the hedge fund is shorting the stock to hedge the swap? Is the 522K representating the transfer of voting rights? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3pnmy2ytzo341.png?width=1262&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b343a7754a1ee78607aaee1e1078a0a0fa3b4613", "created_utc": 1575934217, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e8hzv3/total_return_swap_transaction_used_by_activist/", "is_self": true}
