For a while I lost money. Consistently. I would make a couple thousand lose a couple thousand until my loses outweighed my winners and I hit about 22k. I was playing CSOD ARWR and some other other random shit stocks. \n\nThen about 4 weeks ago, i think, I made 35k overnight on CCL 22c I forget the exact date. You can watch the video and find it lol it\u2019s a straight line up. From there, I made some dumb plays on Tesla since I could afford to buy lots of contracts. Down to 50k. \n\nHit a big SPY call play I forget the exact date, again you can see it in the Imgur. Hit that for about 17k. \n\n67-48k was pretty gut wrenching. I lost 11k one day trying to swing trade SPY options. I\u2019d lose 3k in 10 minutes then try to make it back and just kept losing. Eventually gave up. I was so pissed I could\u2019ve taken my account to zero that day. \n\nAnyways, TODAY I held 308p expiring today over night from yesterday. Made about 2k on them cause I sold right at open. Well I thought I\u2019m positive 2k, let\u2019s keep playing and either lose it or make some more. I proceeded to trade spy puts. I\u2019d buy 100 for around 32k set stop loss at a 1k loss and sell when I was about 20-30% up, then re enter. \n\nI ended up netting about 15k from this and now I\u2019m just chilling. \n\nNot a huge overall gain, but figured I\u2019d share and try to give as much info as I could. \n\nGodspeed retards.", "created_utc": 1593020000.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hf5cki/28226050674863k/", "is_self": true}
