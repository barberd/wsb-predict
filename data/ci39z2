{"id": "ci39z2", "title": "BYND Borrow Rate and SI", "selftext": "From calling around, I am getting borrow rates in the 150% range. S3 hasn't released their borrow rate or Short Interest information yet. However, last night S3 said that the short interest in BYND has remained stable since the beginning of the week. Ergo, this hasn't technically been a short squeeze yet. The reason I put so much faith in their data is because they apparently scrape their data from many large fund managers and see in relatively real-time what short positions and borrow rates are for thousands of large money managers with hundreds of billions of dollars of assets. TLDR: I trust their data. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat being said, BYND's valuation is INSANE at this moment and is being driven by share fundamentals, NOT business fundamentals. We are much [closer to the top](https://imgur.com/fibpp3r) than we are to the bottom and I will look to be selling within the next few weeks. I will make a post on WSB when I do sell, but please know that I CANNOT PICK A TOP and it is better to sell early and lock in gains than to risk the money you have made to eke out a small incremental profit. At this point, BYND is running on pure emotion and 99% of people trading it will get burned. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave a great weekend everyone.", "created_utc": 1564149907, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ci39z2/bynd_borrow_rate_and_si/", "is_self": true}
