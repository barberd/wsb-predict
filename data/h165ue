Look at HEXO, GNUS , and others .... yea they had their run up but generally , these are trading wayyyyy above their pre COVID level and if you read about say a GNUS, you\u2019d realize that yea syndication is great but how the fuck is anyone making content for Q3 and Q4 ????? If this gets really bad Netflix and all the other entertainment stocks are dropping.... there\u2019s no one to make content . It\u2019ll be reruns essentially and Netflix becomes more the WB . \n\n All I\u2019m saying is a guy rode a $25.5k bear position during the covid crash to literally $450k on Tesla puts. \n\n\nWhy isn\u2019t the goal oof this sub to make some fucking money, puts allow you to say hey GameStop your stock is a flaming bag of shit and so are your stores, I\u2019m gonna make money now  for every time you ripped me off on a used game sale???\n\nDon\u2019t you guys loook at some stocks and go.... that\u2019s bullshit? \n\nDon\u2019t you want to make some money? \n\nBe an Autistic bisexual. Buy calls on stuff that\u2019s legit and start buying puts on these pump and dump robinhood stocks  , if your stock is the cost of a  cheeseburger I\u2019m not buying it . \n\n\nThere are some amazing DDs here, but I see a lot of people shitting on the idea of being a bear and generally denigrating anyone that\u2019s trying to tell them you have to be a realist.\n\nYou can make money on puts right now, we have record unemployment and nothing is open...... even if it is.... how much are sales numbers really gonna be? Retail got a pass this quarter because people are bullish but right now, but we have no vaccine or stimulus.... which btw, the stimulus and hope are why this economy sky rocketed. So who\u2019s gonna buy pants when there\u2019s no expendable income or general fear... \n\nWe aren\u2019t getting a stimulus until late July and unless we have an act of god by executive order , all the fuzzy feelings are going away. \n\nEven Kudlow said after July 4th weekend they\u2019d probably have something done. Comes out it\u2019s late July. Trust me democrats are gonna play hardball into the election this shit might get done end of next week but that\u2019s only if everyone gets fucked by stocks. Even Nancy Pelosi\u2019s husband sold his stocks... \n\nThis market is pure speculation , even GPS was going up during literally a dumpster fire on their cash flow and the inability to pay rent. \n\nLet\u2019s be bullish on the next \u201cretail\u201d sector but also be aware that there\u2019s nothing wrong with cashing in on the dips. \n\nWSB bets should be saying stonks only go down for the next week and embrace the gay bear. the afternoon rally ain\u2019t gonna help you hit your call. \n\nBe bisexual my autists", "created_utc": 1591903749.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h165ue/gay_bears_make_tendies_too/", "is_self": true}
