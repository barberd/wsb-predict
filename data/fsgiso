{"id": "fsgiso", "title": "The Darkest Timeline: The Markets and Idiocracy", "selftext": "Yes, JPow threw the kitchen sink at the markets, and made the money machine motorboat the market's vast tracks of land.  Yes, it destroyed, or is currently destroying many aspiring autistic fortunes.  \n\n(Possible unpopular opinion): it was the right thing to do, and possibly one of the most important police actions of the century.  \n\nThis is where Idiocracy comes in.  We have watering the economy with Brawndo for 11 years.  The money machine and the interest shredder have been running regularly during that time.  Corporate debt, auto loans, CLOs and various other warnings have been flashing red for some time as a result of the markets being out of balance for so long.  Enter the biggest monster truck ever built (beer virus), please notice that the collective wealth of the county has a dildo strapped to the roof. \n\nFast forward a smidge, a quarter of the country gets fired, and we aren't even through the first two months of an 18 months of pre-vaccine fun.  Imagine if JPow hadn't thrown the kitchen sink in to slow this shit down.  Imagine 3/4 or more of the country unemployed, and sitting around during a single month.  This brings us to the point where people *could* be climbing the gates of the White House.  They aren't.  The market is up some.  Armageddon has been rescheduled for after we finish talking about Tiger King.  This could be the riot to end all riots, but instead it is Quarantine and chill.  The markets are in a temporary holding pattern while the bad news slowly escalates to the point where no amount of printing will make boomers buy stock.\n\nAt this point nothing is going to grow naturally where we have salted the ground so heavily with the thirst mutilator.  The markets are le screwed.  The only solution is to switch off the printer and shredder and let the market correct and then rebuild itself.  The old Gay Bears were always going to win, eventually.  But they have to be fat and lazy enough to wait out the long printer winter.  \n\nUnhedged options are always going to be high-risk high-reward venture.  Time it wrong, and you will just watch your account value go down like a fake martial arts sensei getting a punch to the head.  I would urge caution while things unravel in commercial mortgages, auto loans and derivatives.  Don't be stupid, and go all in on gold or bonds, as anything with value is likely to be liquidated to cover margin calls if we take another major dip.  \n\nBe aware that people are dying in droves across the globe.  others are realizing quietly that they have a half million worth of mortgage and no way to pay it back.  Still others are eyeballing 401k withdrawals to cover the $1100 Model 3 payment due in the next week.  How long is watching \"Ow My Balls\" going to keep people from panicking?  As an aging semi-gay bear, I am still glad that we didn't go to zero weeks ago.  Stay safe, and try not to lose all your money before things actually get going.\n\nEdit: a few commas, and my positions\n\nPositions: JDST, TVIX, SPXS, cash (yes I know that I am am autistic, thanks)", "created_utc": 1585673722.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fsgiso/the_darkest_timeline_the_markets_and_idiocracy/", "is_self": true}
