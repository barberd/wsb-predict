{"id": "gu8uox", "title": "The Option Spread whose Time HAS COME (SPCE)", "selftext": "Let me introduce you to the ratio spread.\n\nThis is when you buy/sell an ATM option, and then buy/sell 2 (or more) OTM options.\n\nFor example:\nSPCE Short 1x Oct 2020 15 call Long 2x Oct 2020 25 calls\n\nLooks like this: https://www.danielstrading.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/futures-options-strategies_call-ratio-backspread_960x680.png\n\nWhy is this spread perfect for right now?\n\n\u2022First, it wins if a stock moves hard in either direction, similar to a long straddle. Unlike a long straddle, it doesn\u2019t cost you your whole account balance, and its max loss comes from theta decay in the \u201cbelly.\u201d We can easily exit the spread before theta really starts to kick in and own us.\n\n\u2022Second, you can angle the spread to take advantage of your bias, but collect theta if you are wrong. For example, I am bullish GLD, but I recognize it is a crowded trade and could come down from here for awhile. A short call ratio spread that makes money if GLD rockets higher, or dribbles lower, is a nice trade.\n\n\u2022Third it bets on an increase in volatility. \n\nI am going to use SPCE as an example it is perfect for this kind of play.\nThe stock tends to do one of two things. Either rocketship to the moon, or dribble down as a slow bleed. In its long history, it has only had a few rocket ships.  In all likelihood, the calls you are buying at any time to take advantage of the next run up are going to expire worthless as they slowly bleed out after the most recent bull trap.\n\nUsing the example above, you can see what the setup looks like:\n\n\u2022If the stock stays under 15, we will collect the premium from the 15 call\u2026as of right now, that is around 15-30 cents (per spread) of theta gang action.\n\n\u2022If the stock roars higher to 40, the two long calls we bought at 25 will print and the short call at 15 will be a loss, but not as large of a gain as the two long calls.\n\n\u2022The worst case scenario is the stock goes to 25 at expiration where our two 25 calls expire worthless, and we owe 10 bucks on the short 15 call.  \n\nManagement:\n\n-We are not holding this spread to expiration. We are getting out 30-40 days before it pops off.  The risk in this trade is the belly which is all theta decay. Most of the theta decay is in the last 30-40 days of an option spread, where it decays faster than a meth head\u2019s teeth.\n\n-I picked October expiration in the above example. So around early September, this spread is coming off.\n\n-Buying straight calls is only a better play if I get in right before a run higher\u2026and I suck at timing.\nVolatility: \n\n-Our spread is LONG volatility/positive VEGA. This is so important please listen because if you get volatility wrong, you will get crushed. \n\nGo here: https://marketchameleon.com/Overview/SPCE/IV/\n\nCheck IV and see if it is under the yearly historical volatility average.  You will have to make the final call on whether volatility is low enough to put on the spread. \n\nPersonally, I want SPCE\u2019s IV to dip below 100 before I put this spread on. THE IV IS OFTEN MORE IMPORTANT THEN THE EXACT PRICE when placing this spread.\n\n-If at any time in the next few months we get a spike in SPCE IV, our spread does very well. If IV goes down, our spread will suffer.\n\n-It is important to know how the stock is correlated to volatility so we can play it correctly. For SPCE, as the stock goes higher, volatility goes higher. So you want to use OTM calls in your ratio spread. For SPY, volatility goes higher as the stock market goes lower\u2026so you want to use OTM puts in your ratio spread.\n\nLastly on stock selection.  I recommend using a price chart to SEE what kind of move a stock will have to make to cause the \u201cunlimited profits\u201d part of this spread to print. It is often farther away than you think\u2026which is why this spread rules on volatile instruments (like SPCE), which are currently low volatility. This spread sucks on boring shit like TRV and CAT.\n\nTLDR:\n\n-Ratio spread is good for stocks you expect to move a lot, but you are not clear on the timing and wish to avoid the theta decay of outright options.\n\n-Take spread off 30-40 days before expiration to avoid theta risk. You can always roll it if you still believe\n\n-Personally, I would wait for IV to go below 100 for the SPCE short ratio.", "created_utc": 1590965624.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gu8uox/the_option_spread_whose_time_has_come_spce/", "is_self": true}
