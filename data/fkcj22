Read it.\n\n[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6k5ot/rad_is_the_next_spce/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nNow for the update. Yesterday was Analyst Day, and you guessed it, RAD fucking mooned. Last week, it was down over 40%. Not good right? Well yesterday, it shot up 75%. Yeah, this is better than SPCE, TSLA, GILD, or whatever autistic SPY puts you all are buying. You have the chance to get in before earnings (4/9) with 4/17 calls and make fucking bank. \n\nFor the people who\u2019ve read this far: it\u2019s obvious why RAD dropped so much last week. The markets in the shitter, and we\u2019re in a recession. Soon enough, we aren\u2019t gonna be seeing the crazy volatility and the profitability of calls and puts alike. What does that mean? It means we need to find good, undervalued stocks, and make them the new meme stocks. Fuck the biotech companies who all have the new coronavirus cure, they\u2019re dogshit. RAD is it. In case you didn\u2019t read the original post, they reported earnings in mid December. They beat expectations by 270%, and their stock price shot up from $7.50 to $20 in two weeks. That\u2019s 165%. Free tendies. Can\u2019t go tits up.\n\n[Analyst Day Report](https://www.riteaid.com/corporate/news/-/pressreleases/news-room/2020/rite-aid-to-outline-corporate-strategy-and-growth-plan-at-analyst-day)\n\nKey takeaway:\nRAD raised their guidance. Not by a ton, but think about it. A terrible quarter for the economy, and they increase their earnings expectations. Not by a ton, but why would they raise their guidance only to just barely meet it by their earnings call? They know they\u2019re gonna knock it out of the fucking park again and yesterday was just a little taste. \n\n**Tl;dr - If you like money, load up on any RAD 4/17 calls.**\n\nPositions: I\u2019m a broke boy until RAD moons. Only have 1 contract of RAD 15c 4/17. \n\nDear SEC,\nI\u2019m not qualified to give financial advice and therefore I would never give financial advice.
