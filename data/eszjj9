My 1 dollar calls went down to 0,8.  \nI reasoned buy the dip which i did so i doubled down. Problem was the sucker dropped further to 0,5 a contract. Next I quadrupeled down and bought some SPY calls. So luckily TSM and SPY went back up after that and i got back to +- 0 for the day.  \n\n\nNow imagine an announcment like \"tsm factory contaminated with coronavirus\". I would have been fucked.   \n\n\nLesson of the story your fucked:  \n\n\nLets look at the behavioual dd to this:  \nIf you are actually making money your are fucked:  \n\n\nGamblers conceit:  A fallacy where a gambler believes they will be able to stop a risky behavior while still engaging in it.  \"I'll quit while i am ahead\". However you have no fucking incentive to quit while winning. So what will happen if you start loosing?  \n\n\nYou will get fucked by Gamblers fallacy: The more you loose you will say: \"next time is going to be a winner again, i cant loose that much in a row.
