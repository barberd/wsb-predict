{"id": "eofhkz", "title": "If CSPR IPOs @ 1.1B, Then PRPL is the Smart Play", "selftext": "I strongly believe PRPL to be undervalued intrinsically, but on a comparative basis to the proposed CSPR valuation, it is massively undervalued.\n\n**Comparative Basis**\n\nCSPR is supposedly valued at $1.1B after this upcoming IPO.   Whether they can get that is to be seen, but they did line up the full bullpen in book runners for their IPO.\n\nPRPL is valued at about $577M at market close today.  These guys screwed up their IPO a few years ago by using a SPAC with barely any support from real investment banking and floating very few shares.  In November 2019, PRPL did a proper secondary offering from BofA and Oppenheimer which floated far more shares and significantly improved liquidity and trading volume.\n\nFor those of you who don't read financials, these are the numbers that usually form the basis of a stock's valuation.\n\n|*Revenue ($ thousands)*|*9mo Ending Q3 2019*|*2018*|*2017*|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|CSPR|312,319|357,891|250,909|\n|PRPL|304,058|285,791|196,859|\n\nPRPL is almost the same size as CSPR as of Q3, but has a much stronger revenue growth curve, which should command a higher valuation.\n\n|Net Income *($ thousands)*|*9mo Ending Q3 2019*|*2018*|*2017*|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|CSPR|(67,399)|(92,092)|(73,392)|\n|PRPL|126|(19,614)|(8,819)|\n\nPRPL not only has had much lower losses, but actually started turning a profit, and is expected to do so going forward, even with a stronger revenue growth curve.  CSPR won't exist soon without continued investment.   PRPL is starting to spit off cash.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Intrinsic Basis**\n\nI won't bore you with a deeper analysis since most of you haven't read this far, but if you read the earnings call transcripts from the last 4 earnings calls, you will learn:\n\n* The wholesale business is bottom line more profitable for PRPL than its DTC business.\n* The wholesale business is expanding rapidly and is constrained by production currently.  Mattress Firm (amongst other wholesalers) wants PRPL in all of its doors.\n* PRPL is bringing more proprietary manufacturing lines online at an even faster pace in 2020.\n* The new CEO is successfully revamping its DTC business, with results starting to emerge in the recent quarter.  More movement is expected for Q4.\n* PRPL recently saw a large jump in Gross Margin and Operating Margin due to efficiencies recently implemented by management that will persist, according to management.\n\n|*PRPL*|*Q3 2019*|*Q2 2019*|*Q1 2019*|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Revenue ($ Thousands)|117,406|103,004|83,648|\n|Net Income|8,411|(7,341)|(720)|\n|Adj EBITDA|15,300|6,200|6,200|\n\nMost of Q2's Net Loss was driven by non-cash expenses.\n\n**YOLO &amp; Warrants**\n\nAs I've posted twice before, I went all in on PRPL for 520k PRPLW warrants.   The warrants are traded OTC because they were delisted due to having less than 400 round lot holders (there are quite a few holders with several 100k+ warrants).  I'm up about $500k in the last 12 months.\n\n**tl;dr**  Buy PRPL because it will make my YOLO win even bigger.  More importantly, there will be some significant movement in the stock if CSPR actually lands their IPO.  If not, the stock should move on its own.", "created_utc": 1578972262, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eofhkz/if_cspr_ipos_11b_then_prpl_is_the_smart_play/", "is_self": true}
