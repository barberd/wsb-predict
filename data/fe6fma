Everyone and their grandma knows CCL and AMC are played out so what\u2019s next? I\u2019m taking a look at Caterpillar (CAT). They\u2019ve been climbing for the last decade on an increasing dividend and cost cutting. In Q4 2019 demand was already down and now it\u2019s going to fall of a cliff as everyone looks to cut CAPEX and they\u2019re not going to be able to continue the div growth. So far will they fall? In 2008-2009 they were down 50%+ but they\u2019re only down 15% T3M and 7% T1M.
