{"id": "ey2s4i", "title": "Making Sense of the Shanghai Market Opening", "selftext": "So our predictions were correct about the Chinese market and it's plummet. What we did not foresee is that apparently the PBoC infused cash into the largest cap companies, namely the ones in the FXI which many of us shorted.\n\nNow, there are many paths we can take from here. The most popular is jumping ship and transferring FXI puts to ASHR puts to try and clean up from the continuing decline of the peripheral economy.\n\nShit is in [free fall over there](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/markets-in-mainland-china-plunge-9-after-layoff-losses-extend-across-asia-2020-02-02?mod=home-page) only to be caught in the lower circuit breakers of the market. Is this a one-day scenario? Probably not.\n\nAnd the stocks are not the only ones in free fall. Many commodities [also hit their lower brackets](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-column-russell-china-health-commoditi/chinas-commodities-got-smashed-as-expected-now-what-russell-idUSKBN1ZX0GX).\n\nThe problem is, we do not have numbers of how much money is going where from the cash infusions or how long they will last. It may be a safer bet to jump to ASHR as the government is not likely and perhaps does not have the ability to prop up thousands of smaller businesses that are feeling the pinch.\n\nThat's all for now. I will chime in with my trades tomorrow at some point.\n\nBest to you all in the markets tomorrow and this week.
