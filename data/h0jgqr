Lowest point was -350k loss. Initially I bought in at $11/contract. Then I average down and bought more when it was as low as $4/contract.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ujqycvu765451.png?width=953&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ade5c37203ed94a79f1891e909115d558f6877d\n\nToday at close - up +242k (38%). Target exit probably $230-240. At $230, 100% gains, at $240 200% gains. BABA has been bouncing off of $220 for days and finally broke through. It's a slow mover so will have to keep a close eye. Right now it has all the things going for it. I might take profits and roll into a larger far OTM, longer expiry.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l9quw46e65451.png?width=950&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b90982f26d6d4b75cd5c65e9123bf34382bb285\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLike a true autist, I bought in the weeklies when it dipped to $215. Held on for 200% gains.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y5oc2z6t65451.png?width=803&format=png&auto=webp&s=84cb7a9878ab3570f08b40383ca681383e43005c\n\nClosed at the very top of today. 220c 6/12 closed for 200% gains\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2gb30asw65451.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=796d3320fc142e7a0db6a4ea61dcc73c5fe4eaf9\n\n&#x200B;\n\nClosed 225c 6/19 for 100% gains\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ia15o7ey65451.png?width=809&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebb098e683919b4a4d86acfc6a9c7e2d1c9ff4e1\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe best feeling was closing at the top because I anticipated a sell off end of day. I could've let the 225c 6/19 open but profits profits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExpecting to see a gap up tomorrow, if it gaps down I'll be buying the dip. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks to everyone for the positive comments in my first thread.   \n\n\nAlso fuck you BABA doubters.
