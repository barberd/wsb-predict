{"id": "dm0j1o", "title": "$BYND - beast is getting tamed but will it get slayed? break below $100?", "selftext": "Last time this traded below $100 was on June 6, 2019 then hit intraday ATH of $239.71 on July 26, 2019. Definitely lots of news releases recently trying to pump this stock up a bit but there are a few today that reminds investors how competitive this market is with Pizza Hut's Incogmeato pizza going with Kellogg's plant based meat and Tyson having it's own \"Raised and Rooted\" plant based nuggets. Whatever moat BYND thinks its sitting on is evaporating. Thoughts on when (not if) this will break below $100? I'm still wary of a short-squeeze and spike in price given this stock is oversold in the past week (RSI of \\~21).  Any bulls still holding onto this stock? What are your thoughts and plays for earnings release on Monday 10/28 and the lockout expiry on 10/29?", "created_utc": 1571842873, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dm0j1o/bynd_beast_is_getting_tamed_but_will_it_get/", "is_self": true}
