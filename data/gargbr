{"id": "gargbr", "title": "Trolls: World Tour just proper fucked an industry", "selftext": "First post. I sat down thinking what to say, and like usual I blacked out for the past 10 seconds because I'm a functional alcohol with a slight side car of \"hard\" drug usage. You know, what everyone on here peters on about like true fucking chodes; tendies, gains, blow, hookers. This is the way.\n\nEveryone on this sub complains how it has \"gone downhill,\" in true WSB boomer fashion, without fuckall to back up their nihilism. And yet you're right, this place has become a cookie cutter post factory of generic loss porn and low brow analysis. I loved this place in a true blue no pandemic bull market. Lots of sass and outright, naked emotions from true retards like that guy who legitimately thought he didn't owe capital gains to the IRS.\n\nNews flash WSB OGs, times they are a changing and threads across the board are getting bigger, thicker, more meaty. It's post pandemic time and everyone's jerking off figuratively and literally on the internet. In regards to the flood of mediocrity on WSB... there has been a flood of mediocrity on WSB.\n\nThis thread is like a social distanced visit to the nursing home but instead of a nursing home it's a bunch of crippled, broken bears who are all infected with anal poorness due to the Rona and they can't even find solace in their anal plugs because their plugs are what got them here in the first place. And yet you've probably come to expect this amount of preamble bullshit in every thread here to get to the TL:DR\n\nRETARD ALERT: I'm also here to talk about the Travis Scott Fortnite Concert\n\nThis shit set a new standard for the types of media that can be conveyed by the web. Every major record label and heavy hitter agent will be trying to secure their client for the next Fortnite event. Fuck this was smooth, way smoother than Universal spearheading the demise of the theatre distribution industry via Trolls: World Tour. But the numbers don't lie. If you didn't hear AMC is refusing to show any film from Universal Studios because post-pandemic Universal plans on simultaneously releasing all their films in theatres AND on demand. At the same time. Position: RGC puts, any flavor.", "created_utc": 1588233299.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gargbr/trolls_world_tour_just_proper_fucked_an_industry/", "is_self": true}
