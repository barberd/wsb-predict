The death rate is about 1/10th of what is currently reported\n\n2.) The virus spreads at a rate of 10x rate vs what's currently reported\n\nSo what's that mean for the economy?\n\nIMO - we're still fucked. This shows that any re-opening will quickly lead to another surge of infections. The danger of this virus is no longer the death rate. It's the rate at which it spreads and causes hospitalizations. We also still don't understand the re-infection issue. \n\nWatch and learn as the autists in Georgia pave the way.
