{"id": "gf94im", "title": "MGM calls for vegas reopen pop", "selftext": "MGM calls are super cheap rn for June 19. Wynn has been pushing for a reopen by Memorial day. MGM may follow at june 1st. Expect the retarded markets to push these stocks to retarded levels when the headlines come out. MGM is the best stock for this since it has been beaten down severely this week and the floor is at 14 dollars. It retested 17 earlier last week so I can see it popping up to similar levels when MGM opens back up.", "created_utc": 1588866871.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gf94im/mgm_calls_for_vegas_reopen_pop/", "is_self": true}
