So you cannot exercise early. Assume that the exercise price at expiry is $4000.\n\nFor the platform I'm trading on you enter the premium as a number of points per contract represented as a decimal. E.g. 100 points would be expressed as 1.00. For example, if you wanted to pay a premium of 2 points ($20) per contract (same as above) you would enter 2.00.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Buy 5 Puts on XJO that have a strike price of 4750 points\n* 1 point is worth $10 (INDEX\\_MULTIPLIER = 10)\n* Pay a premium of 2 points (2 \\* 10) = $20 per contract\n* Pay a premium of (20 \\* 100) = $2000 per option\n* Pay a total premium of (2000 \\* 5) = $10000 for 5 options\n* Assume index drops by 750 points, does this equate to a $7500 gain per contract? If not, why?\n\n**Edit: I think I fixed it**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7rypkesxmjo41.png?width=508&format=png&auto=webp&s=f75b74012e9c06ccdd9a0ec6cc967c0f6366f9d0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nkkda1zymjo41.png?width=995&format=png&auto=webp&s=ccd9c9117c2b32de2390ac89083768d17f5d5b62\n\nAs per page 23 of [https://www.asx.com.au/documents/resources/UnderstandingOptions.pdf](https://www.asx.com.au/documents/resources/UnderstandingOptions.pdf) a 1 point change reflects a $10 value change (the index multiplier).", "created_utc": 1585019933.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnxxpa/is_this_excel_spreadsheet_correct/", "is_self": true}
