I\u2019m your host and resident autist [u/expander2](https://www.reddit.com/u/expander2/). You have to be able to read to gain anything from this so that rules out about half of you. As always, this is organized from most important at the top to least important at the bottom. A TLDR, plays, and previous DD summaries will be at the bottom. My last posts still stand and hold some good info so check it out for more plays if this isn't enough for you greedy fucks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe world of investing can be a jungle. Gay Bulls, Gay Bears, danger at every turn. That's why we at WallStreetBets pride ourselves at being the best-trained professionals to guide you through the financial wilderness. WallStreetBets, stability, integrity, pride. Now for the real shit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DIS**; I know I go on and on about how we should play the mouse. Disney (DIS) is just such a fucking beast to mess with that it seems you get cock slapped no matter if they go up or down. I don't take any of that back but I am comfortable in saying that they may be a good play in the coming week.[ This post gets into that](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4t8ng/betting_on_the_mouse/) very well. Basically, in the stock market, a share can go up in value even if the company it represents does not have any good news. This is evident in the ENTIRE medical industry rising in value because everyone thinks that coronavirus=money for medical. Some medical companies are going to go under but that doesn't matter to investors because medical is a necessity right now so the price goes up. This happens in every industry. When amazon goes up, other online shopping stocks go up. When Netflix (NFLX) goes up on Wednesday after a good quarter the rest of the streaming industry will probably go up too. Bringing me to my point. Disney owns HULU, Disney+, Star Wars, Marvel, FOX, and a bunch of other shit. These assets are a large part of the streaming industry as a whole. Disney will get a boost in price just because of Netflix. Like what was said in the original post that I linked, DIS 110c and above is a good choice. Just don't be a fucking idiot and bet your whole account on it, or do I don't give a shit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SHOP**; Now, this is a play that scares the shit out of me. As much as I'd like to say I know exactly what is going to happen I sure as hell don't. Shopify (SHOP) is at all-time highs and not by a little either. By almost $100 a share. With demand skyrocketing and there not seeming to be a slow down anytime soon, they could keep going up for a while. However, all-time highs lead to a drop eventually. They release earnings on 5/6 before open. My bet is that they are going to go up and up until earnings then they will drop that day and it won't matter if earnings were good or not. With a rise of this sheer magnitude, this outcome is just what is most likely to happen. Read[ this post about why](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4fbd8/amznshop_the_fundamental_shift_towards_ecommerce/) they are doing great and how it relates to everything but take what I say into consideration. I'm not saying they are gonna drop to $50 a share. Just that they are going to drop after earnings on 5/6 and to play it accordingly. They could keep going up though and that wouldn't be good for us. That's why this play is scary. A company rising this much in value this quickly looks exactly like a pump and dumb by the market makers. Who knows? Maybe people really think that SHOP is the next amazon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bear Porn**; Here on WSB, we all tend to love a good confirmation bias. It makes our dicks hard, tells us exactly what we want to hear, and lets us continue to be stuck in our ways of maximizing losses like a good little retard. Well for those of you that need a good reason to hold your puts until your hands turn blue (don't diamond hands me you know you're just a dipshit), here you go.[ This post gives you more reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4erh0/a_comprehensive_analysis_of_the_continued_bear/) to keep your puts than you could ever hope to read. The post is the Mayan Calendar of apocalypse predictions and will keep you from saying, \u201cYou know what? Maybe I shouldn't hold these puts that have wiped 98% of my account.\u201d Because we all know that getting rid of something that is making you LOSE MONEY is a bad idea. Whatever. I beat my dick raw looking at your loss porn so keep it coming.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, my man [u/howardedwin](https://www.reddit.com/u/howardedwin/) said that the peak of the DOW would be exactly 24,281.16. It hit 24,233.85 before dropping at open today. It sits down about 300 points from the high on Friday as of this writing. If this is the beginning of the drop he was so fucking close to calling it. However, his wager still stands at this point.[ A ban if he is off by more than one point](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fy5b8t/a_prophet_arrives/). I hope for his sake that we are green tomorrow. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDefinitely read my post from 4/14-4/15 (link at bottom) for information about my next plays personally (SATS, and HAS). Good luck fuckers and tune in on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for more WSB DD Summaries!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Disney go up because of Netflix, Shopify go up because people buy mucho things online, keep flogging those flaccid dicks bears I believe in you.\n\nPlays; DIS 110 and up calls for early May, NFLX calls for 4/24, SHOP calls for 5/8 but sell before earnings on 5/6.\n\nPrevious WSB DD Summaries;[ 4/7-4/8](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxtpbi/summary_of_dd_from_4748_plays_and_tldr_included/),[ 4/9-4/13](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0nkrl/summary_of_dd_from_49413_insider_trading_oil/),[ 4/14-4/15](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1x0y4/dd_from_414415_echostar_hasbro_yelp_and_shit_tldr/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDISCLAIMER; I am not personally advocating for any play that I add to this list.
