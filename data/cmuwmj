How long does it take for the 106 in credit to hit my account?  I would like to move into a new position as soon as possible but I am guessing RH is holding that credit and will release it tomorrow morning at open.  Please correct me if I am wrong.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for your help", "created_utc": 1565118616, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cmuwmj/how_long_does_it_take_for_a_credit_from_a_spread/", "is_self": true}
