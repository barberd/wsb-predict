{"id": "hg0unn", "title": "Understanding IV", "selftext": "Can someone explain IV's impact on the decision to buy an option ? I have seen multiple videos and articles, but have not been able to ingrain it.  Investopedia as well as various youtube resources say that if IV is high, it means that there are more option buyers than sellers, so option prices are higher. So, it is a good time to sell options.  But it is also possible that just because the stock is attractive, the number of buyers will stay higher than sellers for a long time, so buying for short to medium term could be a great idea. \n\nWhen I look at the IV of FSLY, I see its IV is close to 117% almost at the highest in quite a while. While it looks like a great buy, the high IV number has me scared.", "created_utc": 1593145054.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hg0unn/understanding_iv/", "is_self": true}
