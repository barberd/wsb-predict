{"id": "ff2ic8", "title": "Historical volatility compared to March 2020", "selftext": "Did some research this morning on historical volatility so we can get a sense of where this downturn might be headed.  This research was heavily influenced on analysis by Ciovacco Capital.\n\nTLDR\n\n* Looked at 10 instances of VIX (Volatility) spikes over last 30 years given recent spike in VIX to 42 from COVID-19.\n* In each case, once VIX reaches its local max, the S&amp;P gave investors significant returns, ranging from 10% to 90%, on average of 40%. The return time frame ranged from 2 months to 3.5 years, but on average took 1.5 years.\n* In most cases, there was further decline in the S&amp;P AFTER the VIX top is reached. This ranged from no further decline to as much as -11% further decline (this 2008 GFC). On average it was an additional 4%.\n* When looking at data before the VIX top,\n   * The range of decline was -8% to -40% (worst in 2008 GFC), on average it was -19%\n   * The amount of days ranged from 10 to 165 (most days 2008 GFC), on average it was 75 days\n\nSo, what does this mean for our current situation?\n\n* On Fri Mar 6 VIX was at 42, slightly below the average of these 10 instances which was 46.\n* ASSUMING this historical pattern holds true and if this REALLY IS our local VIX top\n   * it would suggest we have another -4% decline to go down to 2,855 which should happen over at some point in April (on average it was another 41 days to reach bottom)\n   * From that point, we should see an increase in S&amp;P of 40% to 4,147 out into 2021 (on average took 1.5 years to reach local max)\n* Having said that, The downturn from recent local top (which was on Feb 19 at 3,386) to current local max of VIX has only been 16 days and a decline of 12%, both of which are bit less in duration (average of 75 days) and the price decline (average of -19%) as well as VIX being bit below average (42 vs 46), suggesting VIX may have further room to go up\n\nMy overall takeaways from this\n\n* We don\u2019t know a lot about the impact of COVID-19. For all we know, it could be more like GFC of 2008 instead of being like the \u201caverages\u201d\n* However, when looking at averages and my evaluation of the impact from COVID-19, I believe we have a bit more uptick to go in VIX and then further decline from that. My guess would be we test an overall decline from recent top of 20-25%. This would take us towards 2,500.\n* But there is optimism ahead from that point and we likely we get back to the 3,300-3,500 range based on a 40% uptick from that point\n* Over the coming weeks, I will be looking at VIX very closely to see how our current situation compares to these historical perspectives\n\nAgain would like to call out this research was heavily influenced from Ciovacco Capital research called Stock Market Performance after extreme Volatility Spikes.
