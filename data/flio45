The underlying demand for skincare products is going to plummet due to two reasons during this multi-month quarantine period.\n\n\n1, Women aren\u2019t going outside anymore, so there\u2019s no need for them to put on makeup. How much uglier are your wives right now than they usually are? Are they starting to look like Frida Kahlo? I thought so. \n\n\n2. Acne is going to decrease, a LOT. This is not even close to scientific but people are now washing their hands & showering much more than they ever have. In addition to this, they\u2019re not going outside so they aren\u2019t being exposed to pollution, and even if they are pollution is decreasing from less traffic & factory activity.\n\nMuch of this has not been felt by skincare companies yet because people usually have a month\u2019s supply of skincare/acne product at home. However, this will crush their revenue over time & the next earnings reports for companies like ULTA, KAOOY & KSRYY will be abysmal. \n\n\n**TL;DR:** MSFT 200c 3/20", "created_utc": 1584654868.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flio45/short_skin/", "is_self": true}
