Over these last couple of weeks the quality of DD has gone down quite a bit. More and more people are posting two sentences with no good information whatsoever and calling it DD. This isnt the only reason I'm gonna step back but its one of them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLOGI was the straw that broke the camels back. This market is very irrational and just ridiculous to try and predict. It can be done but wins are few and far between. With premiums for everything being so high its hard to get into anything and be fine with losing. CSCO is my last chance. With my remaining account balance I am holding onto my CSCO calls in hopes that they will pan out and I can go puts on the way down but with today looking the way it does I'm not sure that is gonna happen. I'm gonna take a break and build my account balance back up. Ill be working on a project with another user and I hope it pans out so that when I come back I can come back swinging and make you all the tendies that I have in the past. So this is it for a little while. I will try to answer DM's and shit but I don't like getting bombarded with retarded questions. Youtube is your friend when learning what options are and how they work. Experience (of losing money) is the only way you can really learn what goes on here. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I guess I can only end with this. Good luck fuckers and tune in in a couple weeks for more WSB DD Summaries!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR;** Peace out assholes, see you in a bit\n\n**Plays;** Long ROPE and send me your credit card info", "created_utc": 1589386683.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gj25i7/wsb_dd_im_taking_a_break_from_making_the_dd/", "is_self": true}
