{"id": "e9ic4t", "title": "BURGER KING SPOILED THE NEW STARS... BUY QSR PUTS", "selftext": "Huge DD coming out of Germany (Note: I do not speak German)\n\nBurger King German youtube channel is currently running an ad campaign called Spoiler Whopper in which if you walk into this Burger King restaurant and say out loud the spoilers for the new movie The Rise of Skywalker into BK's app, you get a free whopper. The entire restaurant is covered in spoilers and I can say pretty convincingly that many of the spoilers are true as they have been collaborated by the most prominent leaders in the r/starwarsleaks sub who have previously leaked the other 2 movies correctly. It seems that Burger King is not working with Disney on this ad campaign as they had to censor the actual name of the movie when someone was saying it. Burger King is owned by Restuarant Brands International, ticker sign QSR. I think it is safe to say Disney is gonna be hitting dem whopper boys with a lawsuit. \n\nAlso, why get tendies when you can go to Germany and get a free whopper?\n\nP.S. don't be a dick and post spoilers... that's just un aMerican\n\nP.P.S Literally cant go tits up", "created_utc": 1576122651, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e9ic4t/burger_king_spoiled_the_new_stars_buy_qsr_puts/", "is_self": true}
