{"id": "ftcqzu", "title": "What's not priced in according to someone way smarter and more \"inside\" then I will ever be:", "selftext": "What is not priced it?\n\nI will start this post by saying that I am mostly just regurgitating what makes sense to me that I am reading or hearing about from someone who makes sense to me.\n\nWho am I listening to:\n\n**Mohamed El-Erian (ripped from the interweb)**\n\nMohamed A. El-Erian is Chief Economic Advisor at Allianz, the corporate parent of PIMCO where he formerly served as chief executive and co-chief investment officer, and President-Elect of Queens\u2019 College, Cambridge University.  **( Pimco manages 1.91Trillion of mostly bond side stuff for big boyz)**\n\nDr. El-Erian first joined PIMCO in 1999 and was a senior member of PIMCO\u2019s portfolio management and investment strategy group. He rejoined the company at the end of 2007 after serving for two years as **president and CEO of Harvard Management Company, the entity that manages Harvard\u2019s endowment and related accounts.** Before coming to PIMCO, Dr. El-Erian was a managing director at Salomon Smith Barney/Citigroup in London and before that, he spent 15 years at the International Monetary Fund in Washington, D.C. where he served as Deputy Director before moving to the private sector.\n\nDr. El-Erian holds a master\u2019s degree and doctorate in economics from Oxford University and received his undergraduate degree from Cambridge University.\n\nTLDR = Not a dumbass.\n\n\nWhat is he saying:\n\nThe current situation is unlike anything we have experience before.   It is an economic sudden stop of the global economy that simultaneously kills supply side and demand side.   The closest approximation of what we are experiencing is 1.) a failed state  2.) an natural disaster.\n\n\nHe calls the current bump we have seen as \"a counter trend rally\" that have been supported by managers who have not completly wrapped their head around the new normal.  These managers were still doing quarter end re-balancing as if things will go back to normal quickly.   This produced a rally in equities because managers are re-buying into equities to get their investment ratios correct.  He says that these favorable 'technicals' give investors an opportunity to get out of companies that do not 1.) have tons of cash on hand 2.) don't have access to debt to put tons of cash on hand to weather this storm.  \n\nThe \"Market\" has not priced in the following four things:\n\n* 1.)Most people have not priced in the duration and uncertainty of the \"shock\"\n* 2.)How long it will take to get the money put into place by policy into the hands of businesses\n* 3.)How tricky the restart of the economy will be\n* 4.)The post crisis landscape\n\nUntil these things are priced in it will be more of a downside market from here.\n\n\nLiquidity problems will become solvency problems for some businesses.  What might have been a pause for businesses that a.) don't have a ton of cash on hand b) don't have access to debt to get to cash on hand, will end in them going tits up.  Bankruptcy which destroys shareholders.  \n\n\nThe Bottom is not going to easy to pick.  Too much uncertainty right now.   If you want to invest now ( which he thinks is not a good idea)  Dollar cost average in over then next 5 months.  \nThese are the youtube videos.  Of all the people that I have listened to he seem to have his shit together the most.  \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjzBKtVTdtQ&t=188s\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8UlCWUCO9A\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_ACLGQKxWg\n\n**TLDR  Puts on companies with weak balance sheets/ no cash ->  this situation has the makings to push alot of those companies into bankruptcy.**\n\nGay Bear\nSitting on 4/17 puts till end of week and I will decide if I will sell and roll forward the bones to May 15.\n\n* SPY 170p 4/17 (50% retrace from high)\n* SPY 190p 4/17\n* SPY 200p 4/17\n* SPY 210p 4/17\n* SPY 220p 4/17\n* SPY 190p 5/19\n* SPY 220p 5/19\n* SPY 190p 6/19\n* SPY 200p 6/19\n\nAdditional thoughts of my own: \nThe CARES act allow for two different things regarding people who have retirement funds and have been \"adversely affected\" by Covid19. 1.) it moves the 401K loan provision from 50K to 100K and from allowing 50% of your balance to be loaned to 100%. 2.) It allows for a 100K distribution from your retirement account or 401K with no 10% penalty and allows for three years to pay yourself back (ie roll it back in or roll it to an IRA.) I image that some of the 34% unemployed may take advantage of one or the other, including people who are taking percentage pay cuts ( I know that I am).\n\n**I like what he says about it is easy to make a mistake in this market, but make the mistake that you will regret least.**\n\n\nI believe that the markets will head down, I am risking some of my money to that effect. It may not be my 4/17 Spy puts that pay, or my 5/15, but hopefully my June puts will. Either way, the regret that I dont want to have is that I really believe that markets should go down, the fed is hoping that sending $1200 to people, increasing unemployment, and offering forgivable sba loans to companies to keep them from furloughing everyone, because they understand that wouldn't just be a shit show, it would be a revolution.", "created_utc": 1585789380.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ftcqzu/whats_not_priced_in_according_to_someone_way/", "is_self": true}
