Real Estate Crash Could Follow", "selftext": "Trump mentioned abating student loan interest, but didn't mention mortgages.  The House stimulus bill forgot about mortgages.  As it stands there's a huge blind spot incoming and it's coming from real estate.  Here's why:\n\nMany landlords rely on financing in some manner and don't own their properties outright; after all if you make more in rent than your mortgage interest payment you as a landlord are coming out ahead.  This is a fundamental tenet of small and large landlords (think REITs etc.).  But if the court systems are shutting down and eviction moratoriums are being imposed across the country (because the government doesn't want people on the streets during coronavirus), how are landlords going to keep up rent flow?  Spoiler alert, they can't because on top of the usual deadbeats you are going to have savvy tenants take advantage of landlords by delaying or just not paying rent (think commercial tenants especially) and if there's no court or sheriff to evict landlords are SOL.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd with rent income disruption comes the inability to keep up with interest payments and then the mortgage defaults come in.  In 2008 the defaults came from low-income folks who shouldn't have been given ridiculous ARMs.  This time the defaults could be landlords big and small who just got their rent income kneecapped and with an American government who failed to anticipate the policy consequences of solely focusing on tenants.  Even Italy anticipated this issue by abating mortgage payments for 3 months.", "created_utc": 1584165315.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fidw86/the_usa_govt_forgot_about_need_for_mortgage/", "is_self": true}
