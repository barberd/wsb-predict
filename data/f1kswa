As of right now, I have some GLD calls for end of DECEMBER and some SPCE calls for August. I easily see myself 10x both of these trades at the absolute bare minimum and thus will probably buy a lot of coke and hookers with the tendies associated with them.  I could sell, but I\u2019m not a little bitch ass. \n\nSo, unless Gold drops hard, or Spce actually goes to its real value, i think I need a new trade and instead gonna be some boring ass equity buying ass clown, and just put money in there and not touch it for 2 days or whatever.  I have a real job and needa actually start saving money, and paying bills and thinking for the future.  YOLO'ing money in the stock markets will be fun until the day i die. but now that its starting to be like 69% of a paycheck going into it, I think its time yolo\n\nI am WSBGOD and I will make 8 million dollars, and you need to realize that.", "created_utc": 1581307618, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f1kswa/i_think_i_need_to_call_it_starts/", "is_self": true}
