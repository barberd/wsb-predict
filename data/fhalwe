You need to know there is a HUGE difference between business success and stock success. The valuation of a company has WAY LESS to do with business success than you think. You are right, things will be GREAT for them soon, but not now. \n\nValuations before the virus were at an all time high, companies were using loans that cost a little to make a little more (AT RECORD LEVELS). In fact it\u2019s gotten so bad recently that companies are HAVING to take out riskier and riskier loans just to keep up with the market.\n\nSoooo what does this mean to your brilliant business ventures... \n\nThe same virus that gave the company that opportunity.... Will be the reason it goes down. The general amount of money going into and out of the market is REMARKABLY more important than how good your company does.\n\nPLEASE get out in front and either go cash gang or play options. PLEASE stop posting asking about which stock will be the largest quarantine beneficiary. You can find those yourselves, all of those charts will already be pointing up. ITS NOT TOP SECRET WHICH ARE GREEN WHEN EVERYTHING IS RED. They are all in the same bucket. \n\nI made this post in an attempt to reduce the amount of those posts I would be scrolling through by 1-5% and hopefully my right thumb-joint focused carpal tunnel I\u2019ll obviously be attributing to you all instead of my weird pornhub fetishes I just can\u2019t quite figure out at 4am. \n\nAnyway I\u2019m done, guess what time it is ;)\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nUPDATE***\n\n*Account balance +300% since last post*\n\n\nNow that we are in the full heat of this I thought I would post an update. After today\u2019s after hours movement, it\u2019s safe to say full on recession is inevitable. So AGAIN please do not chase obvious plays that are already down 60%. \n\nYour airline/casino/cruise plays are running out of meat on the bone as far as shorting stuff goes. The best question always is... What\u2019s next?\n\nSo typically as risk tolerance shrinks we see a broad decline. These boomers are finally scared and they will be dropping ETF\u2019s and other huge buckets of stocks soon. SO WE HAVE TO HIT WHATS STILL PROPPED UP.\n\nTECH BANKS REAL ESTATE HOMEBUILDERS, this is where the juice remains. Find anything with a lot of debt, a high PE ratio, low cashflows or any other warning sign and hammer those puts for April or June. This thing is unwinding fast and once we shake the tree a lot of weak branches are going to fall out. \n\nPersonally I\u2019ve moved out of my airline/Casino puts and flipped over to stuff like DOCU and AMD. There may be some hotels with meat left and some lesser thought of restaurants like Texas Roadhouse will be hammered as well.\n\nStay ahead of the curve.
