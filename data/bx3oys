{"id": "bx3oys", "title": "The Autistic Birthday Gift", "selftext": "I'm a buy and hold investor with a 150k+ account with 20% CAGR over a few years, but I have an addiction to FD trading and huge FOMO for WSB gains.  My /r/investing low cost ETF friend has always warned me about the dangers and risk of options.  \n\nLast year for my birthday, my friend gave me $50 to trade FDs, so I wouldn't trade options with my 150k account.   \n Here's how that experiment went: \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/lse8wq0o0k231.png\n\nTSLA calls, SNAP puts, if it was a meme stock and had options available, you bet I traded it.  Despite the thrills and depression of my self proclaimed trading expertise, I am glad I finally got a tiny taste of the WSB life last year.  Had I invested my 150k account, I would have had 1.3 mil at the peak.  I can only hope that I would just cash out if that situation happened for real.\n\nToday's my birthday again, but now he's no longer funding my addiction.  This is not fair, how can he give me a small hit and then refuse to keep feeding my vices?  Hopefully I will grow some balls and join you guys soon by yoloing my stonk portfolio.\n\nI just hope that other users who are scared of risk also have friends who are willing to be generous and introduce them to the WSB life.  Have a nice day y'all.", "created_utc": 1559747614, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bx3oys/the_autistic_birthday_gift/", "is_self": true}
