But oil literally took a gigantic morning after a giant jalape\u00f1o bean burito shit for no fucking reason about 40 mins ago and is immediately recovering.\n\nThis tells me that whales just got some inside info that Alexander Novak aka Putin's marionette is about to come out and agree to the extra 1.5mbbd cut and dumped their short positions to go long.\n\nI know the majority of u cucks are USO traders.
