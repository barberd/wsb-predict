One that they have not paid a penny for yet.    In fact, you pay them to do the marketing work for them.\n\nYou literally have paid (lost) your own real money, credit rating, and gone bankrupt for screen shots that has carried their brand and platform to every boomer and millennial news outlet in the world.\n\nAny news is good news, and as a company that is hell bent on unseating the bigs in stock trading, they couldn't ask for a better outcome.   A few lines of code and they'll reap the same reward as every stock trading news outlet in the world re-runs the story with all your screenshots showing that its now fixed.\n\nEven if you add up the assumed loss that they have to eat because they'll never get you to pay up, you're forgetting their algos already front run the fucking trades anyway negating that.   It's why their platform is free because they're using autists as fuel.     Even if they had to pay it would still be 1/1000000000th the expense of a marketing campaign. \n\nJesus christ there is so much idiocy here.", "created_utc": 1573038493, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dsethn/breaking_wsb_degenerates_fund_new_robinhood_brand/", "is_self": true}
