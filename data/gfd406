{"id": "gfd406", "title": "PRMW Earnings today - Sparkletts", "selftext": "These guys own a bunch of water delivery groups.  Sparkletts couldn't keep fucking water in stock during this, they sold their balance and more.\n\nWorth a shot, bought in march $7.70, long 10 calls for August.  Looking for this to hit about 13.  Probably out after the earnings today.\n\nNo links or nothing, just letting you know before the earnings drop.  \n\nTLDR:  Water delivery to homes.  Couldn't keep stock of their small bottles (higher margin) and delivered mass quantities of larger bottles compared to usual.", "created_utc": 1588878986.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfd406/prmw_earnings_today_sparkletts/", "is_self": true}
