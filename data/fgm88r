A: \"working on details, don't want to give out any numbers but a proposal has been made\" \"doing the best we can\"\n\nQ: \"in 2018 fed payroll taxes generated $1.17T dollars and it can be made back up in general revenue, if PR taxes cut, where are you going to get that money from?\" A: \"you know uh let us put the proposal out in concrete details and flesh that out, right now i want to stay in my lane we will do the best we can to give you specific details once we flesh them out, right now we want to focus on the coronavirus health story\"\n\nQ \u201care you looking at a bailout on cruiselines?\" A: dodgeball, no answer\n\nAll other questions regarding the economy were dodged.\n\nNot related to today's market but an interesting nugget.\n\n\"will always maintain a solvent social security system\"\n\n**TLDR: No concrete moves on the stimulus package so far, and virus will get worse before it gets better was the substance of the conference.**\n\nMaybe my puts expiring tomorrow have some hope. SPY down $4 AH so far but still a long way to go for me to recoup any of today's 80% loss (not making any recommendations, do your own research).
