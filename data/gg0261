Only problem for me is I usually don\u2019t buy options. After the initial crash in March I\u2019ve switched to being a proud Theta-Ganger.\n\nI\u2019ve been on the correct side of a lot of earnings plays these past few weeks: BYND, PTON, SNAP to name a few. Only difference is when y\u2019all were buying Calls, I was mainly selling Cash Covered Puts.\n\nThis resulted in a lot of quick flips and easy money, but far less profit than if I had bought Calls.\n\nMy theta-gang compromise involves both. Using CSCO as an example, I sold a CCP, bought Calls, and still came out with a net-credit.\n\n$39.50p 5/29 is what I sold for $60 credit\n\n$50c 5/29 x4 is what I bought for $46\n\nFor those not familiar, selling a Put requires a lot more collateral, in this case $3950. This is one downside to being an options seller. The upside is there\u2019s a lot more scenarios where I\u2019m a \u201cwinner\u201d. IV crush (Vega), and time decay (Theta) are my best friends, especially the day after earnings.\n\nAnother personal upside is that I\u2019m perfectly okay with buying CSCO at $39.50. In fact I think that\u2019s a fucking steal, and I can even sell Covered Calls on them if I do get assigned.\n\nAlso, at the time I made this play, there was a 75% chance that my Put doesn\u2019t end up in the money. This puts the odds very much in my favor to exit this trade profitably.\n\nI haven\u2019t seen a name for this play but I unofficially deem it the Cash Covered YOLO.\n\nThis will be my first time trying it out, but it appears to be a nice way to get some more upside on your plays, while sacrificing some credit upfront.", "created_utc": 1588966922.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gg0261/the_cash_covered_yolo_an_amatuers_guide_to_free/", "is_self": true}
