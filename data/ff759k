MO is trying to evolve and failing at every turn. Vaping JUUL (black market weed vapers destroyed that market and hurt the stock). Weed (CRON)  (lol). and now it's kind of sitting there. However, they pay some sick dividends and pretty much a blank check company. I think eventually the world will realize vaping is better than smoking and when weed is finally legal in the US if MO has any sense they can kind of leverage those companies to hit the ground with vapes using JUUL. Edibles using Kraft. (you know all the stuff that actually has margin to it.. and isn't undercut by the black market and too dangerous to buy from the black market). There's no money if dry flower.   \n\n\ntldr MO has to evolve. MO has the money to wait a lot of turmoil. MO Pays good dividends MO is cheap.", "created_utc": 1583640099, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ff759k/mo_is_now_a_growth_stock_imo_and_is_going_to_win/", "is_self": true}
