After coming back from taking him out, I realized he already shit inside. Whatever, so I cleaned it up almost puked and decided to stay up for the market to open and listen to the BUD ER call. \u2014 I have $92 buy/91.50 sell calls. Positive EPS!!! Yay!!!! Fucker drops 10% on open. \n\nSPY is up! So, that\u2019s good! I\u2019ve got 299 calls on that! It\u2019s down -$20 for me. Not the end of the world, now I can\u2019t get a 30 rack of keystone... seriously, when can I catch a break?! \n\nNow, at 10am, I\u2019m already over this day. Sitting naked on my bathroom floor with the shower running in the background while drinking a beer and writing this. \n\nFuck this day.", "created_utc": 1572019694, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dmzldi/hows_your_day/", "is_self": true}
