{"id": "g4h8lu", "title": "Anticipating a Highly Predictable and Massive Spike on Snap Inc. (SNAP)", "selftext": "This is one of the most beautiful set-ups I\u2019ve seen in my almost 10 years of investing for a series of very specific reasons.\n\nThe overall reason is that this company has a very large amount of confusion regarding it. If you take a look at the chart at this time of writing on April 19th at 5:41 PM EST, you can see that SNAP closed around $13.00 a share on Friday, April 17th, which is literally right in the middle of the spike high in January at $20.00 and the low in March at $8.00 (see below). This is EXTREMELY important for three reasons:\n\n[SNAP April 19th, 2020](https://preview.redd.it/gs6zd51ltut41.png?width=3324&format=png&auto=webp&s=150812f57189481d715db221d1c7187569e8b8f2)\n\n1. It shows that unsure AND overly confident sellers are selling aggressively in anticipation of earnings to push it back down.  \n2. It shows that there are enough buyers in the stock to spike it back toward the previous highs in anticipation of earnings, who will also willingly add more once it spikes right back up to the highs.  \n3. It shows that people are extremely indecisive on whether to buy or sell, and are looking for more confirmation to buy or sell whatever shares they are looking at adding or removing respectively.\n\nTo understand the first reason, we have to look into what these three elements mean. They show that once the stock starts to move in one direction, the masses will take over and push it exponentially higher in one direction. In this case, the odds favor the bulls so they will push it much higher once earnings comes out.\n\nThe reason the bulls will initially push it higher is that the confusion is centered around Ad revenue. The general worry is that ad revenue will not be as good as anticipated due to people staying home, losing jobs, and not being potential consumers once the virus has run its course and life returns to normal once again. This is an irrelevant point because it doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is how does Snap do relative to what was expected. The general expectation is a drop in ad revenue and we very well may see that, but the odds EXPONENTIALLY favor a much higher than expected revenue number which will cause the initial spike.\n\nOnce unsure investors realize they were wrong about the aforementioned point, they will continue to buy in because they will realize that not only is ad revenue higher than expected, but that Snap has a business model that bodes profoundly well for the near and, most importantly of course :), the long-term future.\n\nThe Daily Active Users (DAUs) will increase exponentially and show that Snap is positioned perfectly for the retaining and entertaining of an increasing number of users as they realize Snap IS a viable compliment to Instagram and Tik Tok and offers a competitive advantage unlike these two over time.\n\nTo sum, I anticipate a gap up and spike toward the 18-23 area by Wednesday April 22, 2020.", "created_utc": 1587336790.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4h8lu/anticipating_a_highly_predictable_and_massive/", "is_self": true}
