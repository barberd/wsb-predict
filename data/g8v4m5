{"id": "g8v4m5", "title": "WLL - Retail bulls pumping an already bankrupt company", "selftext": "I was going through some statistics on my [favorite site](https://robintrack.net/) for ideas of stocks to buy puts against by inversing Robinhood investors, and noticed something interesting.\n\n[Robinhood most bought tickers last week](https://preview.redd.it/dmhqsovivav41.png?width=1166&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0becba9b98ac102706aa05c47978be684f053b)\n\nLet's ignore that idiots are still buying $USO, since I already made a [few](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5smyo/weird_stuff_going_on_with_uso/) [other](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6zkc1/a_smoothbraineds_guide_to_oil_futures_and_uso/) posts talking about this, or the fact that the 12th most bought ticket is an ETF that is in the process of closing. What drove my curiosity was the action going on with $WLL, so I took a closer look.\n\n[$WLL Robinhood users holding shares](https://preview.redd.it/m27lrnlxvav41.png?width=3492&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f9e83b8123b2bd0545f86bf150a434688411459)\n\nHopefully everyone reading this already has heard of Whiting Petroleum ($WLL), which is the biggest oil producer to have went bankrupt in 2020, entering [Chapter 11 bankruptcy](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1255474/000119312520093737/d899645d8k.htm) on April 1. For some idiotic reason (i.e. \"buy the dip\"), retail investors started to pour money in to this stock after that happened, with the number of Robinhood holders going from around 12k users to over 40k users since they've announced bankruptcy, many of them coming in the past few days. This volume of retail buyers has actually caused the price to go surge in price.\n\n[$WLL, Hourly](https://preview.redd.it/0a00v3jnyav41.png?width=2096&format=png&auto=webp&s=864b91d165c6b9a2cf9d522f83a15172f8ccb922)\n\nIn fact, this stock is almost 200% up since they declared bankruptcy, somehow?\n\nThey've also recently announced a [restructuring agreement](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1255474/000119312520118310/d922194d8k.htm) with their creditors on Friday, where the bond holders will receive 97% of the restructured company's equity, and the existing shareholders (i.e. the current $WLL shareholders), will only own 3% of it, pending bankruptcy court approval. This means, at the current stock price of $1.22, you're betting that the same amount of ownership in the new restructured company is worth $37.33. Their January highs, before everything happened, was at $8.66. Clearly there's something very wrong going on here, and this is just \"buy the dip\" retail bulls pumping up a bankrupt stock without understanding how bankruptcy work. At best, it should be worth $0.26, if we valued $WLL's post-restructuring market cap to be the same as their January levels.\n\nWhat's that smell? Money.\n\nTLDR; Profit off buy-the-dip retail bulls, $WLL $0.50p 5/8", "created_utc": 1587968533.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g8v4m5/wll_retail_bulls_pumping_an_already_bankrupt/", "is_self": true}
