{"id": "fefjej", "title": "OPKO CALLS FOR DAYS YOU TARDS", "selftext": "First time posting so be gentle to my already loose butthole you autists.\n\nOPKO is a relatively small medical test company that focuses its business on diagnostics.  WELL WADDYA KNOW, we have the corona virus already giving bears dicks so big and hard that at some point, they really should go to the doctors to get it checked out.  But before you do, let me cockle your goods one more time with the juice on OPKO.\n\nLocation matters:  It's located in various major cities and states, BUT ALSO IN VARIOUS PLACES IN EUROPE.  With a diversified portfolio of locations, they are able to reach more people in locations that have already been stricken with the beer virus.\n\nTiming matters: Companies looking to treat fellow autists for the beer virus such as Inovio, are looking to start human trials for the beer virus vaccine in April.  TO TREAT FOR THE BEER VIRUS, YOU NEED TO BE DIAGNOSED WITH THE BEER VIRUS.  WHO BETTER TO DIAGNOSE YOU THAN OPKO???  \n\nUS Government matters: Testing kits have severely lagged demand and the CDC is literally begging the private sector to come up with their own testing kits.  OPKO released news that they will receive specimens for testing and begin their tests NEXT WEEK.  GUYS FRICKEN NEXT WEEK.  YOU LITERALLY CANNOT GO TITS UP.\n\nNow here's the kicker: The stock market is going down because of the negative business impacts the beer virus has to production, operations, attendance, etc (duh).  THE BEER VIRUS HAS THE OPPOSITE EFFECT ON OPKO, MORE DISEASE --&gt;MORE TESTING--&gt;MORE REVENUE--&gt; HARDER PEENS\n\nNow if the stock market goes up to reverse some of the correction, THIS STOCK WILL RIDE THE WAVE AND ALSO GO UP!  \n\nSTOCK MARKET GOES DOWN, OPK GOES UP, STOCK MARKET GOES UP, STOCK GOES UP.  I SAY THIS AGAIN, YOU LITERALLY CANNOT GO TITS UP.  \n\nNow get ready folks.  the stock isn't worth all that much ~ $2.50 at the time of me writing this.  That means any news on the beer virus (which happen daily) will only make this stock skyrocket faster than you can take out a 4th mortgage.  I've got call positions up the wazoo, jk I don't have that much money, but I have 10 $3 calls expiring 4/09.  \n\nRisks:  Pshhhh", "created_utc": 1583510598, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fefjej/opko_calls_for_days_you_tards/", "is_self": true}
