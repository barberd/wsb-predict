Aka how to make your standard bet a double bet for less capital allowing you to buy more of both!\n\nWhat are those you ask?\n\nYou sell and buy a call/put at the same strike with different expiration dates. Lets say $WSB @69 \u00a7  \n\nYou sell a call for short term expiration and buy a call for longer term. \n\nHow does this work 6800s? \n\nIf the short term you sold gets exercised the two options are \"chained\" so that covers the call you sold.\n\nWhy do this anon?\nWell my dear bear, if you do this right and option you sold expires worthless, you paid less for your options and that way manages to buy more! (Like a double dare!)\n\nLet me know what you retards get! \n\n \nTl;dr calendar spreads to offset cost of the long term option letting you buy more", "created_utc": 1586575341.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fyvhzq/itt_how_to_maximize_risk_and_profits/", "is_self": true}
