I've just read that Altaba, the formerly second largest shareholder recently sold $500 mio worth of shares in the last days:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Since the commencement of the Fund\u2019s Alibaba sales on January 13, 2020 and through January 15, 2020, the Fund has sold 2,196,592 Alibaba Shares at an average price per Alibaba Share of $227.63 for total proceeds of approximately $500 million.\n\nSource: [https://www.altaba.com](https://www.altaba.com/)\n\nThey sell their shares because Altaba is in the process of getting liquidated.\n\nVolume 13th to 15th was \\~45,5 mio, so their 2,2 mio sold shares are accounting to \\~4.8% of traded shares. I guess that's enough to influence the share price, so this selloff might be an interesting entry point considering earnings will be reported on 29th.\n\nDisclaimer: I don't know anything and I am long BABA :-P", "created_utc": 1579192441, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eplp1z/baba_at_discount/", "is_self": true}
