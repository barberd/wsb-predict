{"id": "gjr5s4", "title": "DD: WORK - Slack Earnings Coming Up and Why You Should Play The Run Up", "selftext": "Okay Retards,\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# SLACK (WORK)\n\nBottom Line upfront: As Q1 earnings season winds down there are still a few gems left to mine. Enter WORK. You've probably heard of Slack. Their earnings will be on June 4th. I believe the hype around this stock will cause it to Moon before earnings and that's the play we are making here, who cares what happens after they print, we are here for the run-up. Like many other tech meme stonks, they run before earnings and there is still time to take advantage of that run up with a few weeks of lead, while the greeks are still in our favor and premiums are low.\n\n**Words:** Slack has become a household name (read: Meme) in the WFH world and is becoming the \"bandaid\" brand of the work communications the same way ZM is. Both it and Microsoft Teams are basically priced nearly the same for equivalent tiers of service but teams has had a slower marketing start than WORK. Slack has also beaten earnings since IPO and should expect to see an even higher earnings expectation with the rise in WFH.\n\n**Trends:** Slack peaked at its IPO and stayed above teams throughout since and saw another spike that coincided with teams when the market was nearing the recent bottom.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/296a09c1ory41.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&s=2490a44816a5c71e5760fea7fa73b10d40c9fde2\n\nSince its bottom in March, the share price has steadily increased and in the past 2 weeks is seeing faster if still volatile growth and is hitting its ATH since the initial IPO sell-off WORK experienced.\n\nVoodoo BS TA: Bottom side resistance is strong at 30 and continues to see a higher peak. I don't believe in TA but the trend is the trend. Interest in the last month has increased the price by almost 25% already.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8m847qhiory41.png?width=553&format=png&auto=webp&s=425473d629563cca0dc5bca82e26fca68b498bae\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fi919axjory41.png?width=522&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d6ffd6c9c45d6bf568d7d7d91f623ab0da42967\n\nTL;DR / Don't sleep on Slack and capture the run-up to earnings AH on 4 June, sell before close.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAutist Positions:\n\n~~40c 5/22 - They are basically free right now~~  Only if you like scratch offs\n\n31c 5/29\n\n32c 6/5\n\n35c 6/5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Seeing a lot of early hate here. I am trying to create a helpful post about a position I believe in and will continue to hold as time comes. Please give me better feedback than \"pump and dump\" so that I can increase my post quality and not get called a scammer. My interest is only to perform the same service to you guys that I've taken from other DD posters where I see the opportunity to do so.
