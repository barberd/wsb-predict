No, it was not the trade talk rumors that keep pushing things up. It's the expectation of massive inflation on the horizon due to Fed rate cuts.\n\nYou see, asset values are _actually_ going down. Wall Street folks aren't dumb; they know bad things are coming for the market and our economy, and they are actually setting lower prices on things based on projected valuations. It's just that inflation is shooting up under our very noses and we simply due not have the ability to detect these subtle hints; the same way we lack the ability to detect social cues like the twitching of ladies' sex organs beneath their skirts as they side-eye our RobinHood charts from behind their cocktail glasses.\n\nSo that $315 SPY you see out there? It's actually only worth $250 in 2018 dollars. And that $265 [Tim] AAPL? It would cost $170 back before Powell got his balls snipped. So fear not, bears. You just gotta go with higher strikes on your puts. Those $2,000 12/13 AMZN going for $238 are really going to cost 100 of today's dollars... any day now.\n\nYou can trust me; I've been subbed here for like 3 years.
