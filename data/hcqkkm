{"id": "hcqkkm", "title": "SHLL/HYLN will rocket like VTIQ/NKLA", "selftext": "SPAC Tortoise Acquisition (SHLL) announced it's target for merger on Friday, Hyliion.  \n  \nHere is the investor presentation: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759631/000121390020015311/ea123187ex99-3_tortoiseacq.htm  \n  \nThe comparisons to NKLA are already being made:  \n* https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/19/move-over-nikola-investors-will-soon-have-another.aspx  \n* https://medium.com/@ManuMayor/is-hyliion-the-next-nikola-already-5c324d9a56da  \n  \nThey already have sales for their retrofitting technology which is a perfect solution for fleets wanting to go \"green\" without having to replace the whole fleet.  \n  \nBut, they also have **binding** pre-orders (1000) for their electric ERX Hypertruck.  Not only is the performance of the ERX highly competitive with NKLA/Tesla, the technology for their ERX is not just carbon-neutral, it's carbon-NEGATIVE (read how here: https://sustainablebrands.com/read/cleantech/how-corporate-fleets-can-go-carbon-negative-now).  You also don't need to wait for charging station infrastructure to be built, this tech is ready to go now as there is a wide network of NG fueling stations already out there.\n  \nIn any case, anyone that was sad about missing the NKLA train early on is probably going to FOMO into this anyhow and SPACs have gone crazy in general.  Friday was already nuts and looks like the craziness will continue Monday.  Buy warrants.  \n  \nEDIT: Some more links to read about their hybrid tech  \n  \nhttps://www.hyliion.com/hyliion-wins-jim-winsor-memorial-technical-achievements-award/\n\nhttps://www.hyliion.com/hyliion-earns-top-20-product-award-heavy-duty-trucking-magazine-6x4he-intelligent-electric-hybrid-truck-solution/\n\nhttps://blogs.scientificamerican.com/plugged-in/hyliion-takes-home-big-prizes-at-rice-business-plan-competition-with-its-hybrid-18-wheeler/", "created_utc": 1592675487.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hcqkkm/shllhyln_will_rocket_like_vtiqnkla/", "is_self": true}
