{"id": "f3j6ri", "title": "Can someone explain this MSFT pounding to me?", "selftext": "MSFT down $5 and change the last 3 days on a string of unfortunate events and I'm sitting here struggling to figure out why they're taking a beating while all other big tech is up or flat.\n\n1. Tuesday morning drop due to probably being over bought. Ok, I get that - we've had a serious run up lately and there was bound to be some profit taking.\n2. Tuesday afternoon FTC announcement. Is this really THAT big of a deal? I mean all of those companies were playing within the rules...now they want to go back and punish them for that? I can't believe that the FTC is actually going get away with fining anyone or make them unwind any of the previous deals. If they think it's a problem, just change the threshold and be done with it.\n3. Wednesday morning another dip sell off - ok, we're a bit over bought and this is just a correction. That was followed by a small rally back to end with a small gain at the end. Cool, we'll just tread water for a bit before resuming the push to $200.\n4. Thursday morning bad Coronovirus news but we shrug it off since Microsoft really doesn't have the kind of China exposure as say Apple. Then we rally on the news of a price target increase...everything looking good now.\n5. Thursday afternoon the Jedi Contract news. This really just feels like a personal slight against Trump and I'm glad the judge is making them pony up some cash to compensate Microsoft for this bs. It's stupid that this is gonna drag out but I can't imagine the contract being taken away.\n\nCan someone explain where in this timeline is the super bad news to cause MSFT to drop 2.5% in 72 hours cause I don't get it.\n\nFull disclosure - I'm sitting on 2/28 187.5c and 3/20 200c and have taken a 60% beating this week. I would love to buy the dip but I'm out of capital to do so. Right now it feels like its no longer a question of IF I'm going to lose out, but HOW MUCH I'm going to lose. I thought my hands were strong but they starting to shake after that contract announcement and the Theta Gang is approaching with pitchforks and torches.", "created_utc": 1581637339, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3j6ri/can_someone_explain_this_msft_pounding_to_me/", "is_self": true}
