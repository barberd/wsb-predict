{"id": "fbh8t5", "title": "DD from inside Wuhan", "selftext": "So I got a chance to call a friend living near Wuhan last night. It\u2019s looking like things are getting better quickly, as he put it: his area is still a \u201clevel 1 threat\u201d but many of the other effected provinces or whatever have been moved down to level 2 and the virus seems to be under control. That being said, only about 1/3 of the factories are open so there\u2019s still the risk of a huge supply chain issue in the near future.\n\nRight now I\u2019m in EWY (Bought Tuesday) and EWJ (Friday) April 17 puts. I\u2019m thinking I need to wait (hope lol) for more bad news next week and exit by Friday. Might get some calls mid March if I\u2019m feeling greedy, obviously prelubing my asshole just in case.\n\nThoughts?", "created_utc": 1583002873, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbh8t5/dd_from_inside_wuhan/", "is_self": true}
