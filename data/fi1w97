{"id": "fi1w97", "title": "SPY going to 170 or lower, but don't buy puts.", "selftext": "The 11 year bull market saw a 400% increase in value. Every time bull market value was over a 300% increase, the following bear market saw 50% - 60% drops from highs, with the bear market lasting between 1.5 years and 2.5 years.\n\nSPY could reach a low of 135 - 170 before this bear market ends, especially once the recession hits (which everybody is now expecting due to the coronavirus).\n\nThat said, the rate of decline is expected to slow down considerably.  That means put options will lose value even if the market goes down - due to vega.  So the best play right now is spreads.  Sell call options instead, and make money.\n\nTLDR: Stop buying puts. Sell calls instead.  Vega is going to crush you.\n\nEDIT: Selling naked calls is very risky, and your broker probably won't let you do that.  The best play is spreads. This requires margin and Options Level III authorization. There are many spread and staddle strategies available. You'll have to decide which is best for you.", "created_utc": 1584115264.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fi1w97/spy_going_to_170_or_lower_but_dont_buy_puts/", "is_self": true}
