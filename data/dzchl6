I just sold it to take my profits as I don\u2019t like the fund anymore. Where should I park my money. What are some diverse funds that have done well over the past 10 years. I want something with its foot in TECH and consumers. I would be willing to put it in a few select stocks as well. \n\nThanks.", "created_utc": 1574303168, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dzchl6/sold_370_shares_of_frgix/", "is_self": true}
