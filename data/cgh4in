{"id": "cgh4in", "title": "Reconnecting with another WSB darling ($DVAX)", "selftext": "\nWaiting on another flight, so here's some DD on another 2017-vintage WSB favourite: Dynavax ($DVAX).  This one was good for consistent 4-5% swing trades back in 2017-8 before management rode it Dr. Strangelove-style into the ground.\n\nBackground: $DVAX is a biopharmaceutical focused on a Hep-B vaccine (important) and until recently, a solid oncology pipeline.\n\nIts Hep-B vaccine is set to become the standard of care in the US due to its unexpected clean label designation and (also unexpected) approval for treating diabetics.  Unlike its competitors, it is a 2-dose regimen (compared to 3 for others).\n\nIt's cancer pipeline includes the SD-101 adjuvant that basically increases the efficacy of other treatments. Quite effective too (its ORR was over 70%). \n\n**The Bad**: The company had basically Kirk Vanhouten levels of managerial impotence under its (now former) CEO. Well, incomptence and/or hubris.  The plan, as they describe it, was to use revs from their Hep-B vaccine to fund their oncology pipeline and partner up with a large bio co by mid-year 2019. The CEO had unrealistic conditions and so it's been left to wither on the vine.\n\nBasically, a week after decent earnings in May, the CEO announces he's leaving and that the oncology division would be spun off. The company has been pretty much silent since (given that their IR is also the worst).\n\nThe company also has a $30m revenue target to hit for 2019 under the terms of a lease agreement, which sort of looms over the company (although they have guided to handily beat $30m for the year).\n\nLong story short, this is one of those frustrating stocks where they release good news and the price craters 30%. Bios are up 5% and it will be down 10.  Very long, slow crash from the low 20s to low 3s.\n\n**The Good**: \n\nTheir Hep-B vaccine is legit and gaining solid market share, and they are on track to be profitable by the end of 2019. Their interim CEO gave a presentation to William Blair last month where he guided a strong beat of the $30m revenue requirement (and, again, since IR is awful, they never PR'd that). They have some big-name clients as well, including the Department of Defense. http://investors.dynavax.com/static-files/7301651a-e5d1-4304-82e2-2ed380f240dc\n\nTheir nearest competitor also recently failed to hit a secondary endpoint (2-dose efficacy) of their own Hep-B trial, so $DVAX is alone in having a two-dose regimen for the foreseeable future.\n\nA large (85%) portion of shares are held by institutional investors, including a recently disclosed 5% stake by Integrated Core Strategies (who have a famously short patience for CEOs dicking around).\n\nWhat also might help is there was a large amount of open put interest in $DVAX until the July expiry last week. Going forward though, there's not much at all. Definitely more open call interest from August through January. Not doing much for it today, but that should ease some of the downward pressure.\n\nCantor Fitzgerald on July 10 also upgraded the stock to overweight and put a $20 PT on it.\n\n**tl;dr**: Their (former) CEO sucked and the share price is basically at rock bottom (it's lower than it was before their Hep-V vaccine was approved).  That said, it's got a lot of positives and there's significant upside if you've got steady hands.\n\n**Disclosure**: I'm in for 1750 shares and will likely add more after today's, ahem, unpleasantness.", "created_utc": 1563820751, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cgh4in/reconnecting_with_another_wsb_darling_dvax/", "is_self": true}
