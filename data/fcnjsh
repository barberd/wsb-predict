{"id": "fcnjsh", "title": "Robinhood Crash conspiracy theory", "selftext": "I have a non evidence based conspiracy theory that either TD, Schwab, or Fidelity conspired to secretly pay a fat reward to a programmer who works at RH to somehow break the app on purpose, causing customers to get pissed and move to another brokerage.  There can be a possibility that one of these brokerages are also hiring Reddit users on places like r/wsb to subtly promote moving to their brokerages and swaying where the mass of angered robinhood users end up going.  In addition, think about the time of day they decided to do this.  They did it on a Monday.  That is when users are able to transfer cash within the 3 day bank period and are eventually able to use their new brokerage within that week so that the angered customers and autist have an incentive to switch ASAP!  What do you think? I know, gay right?", "created_utc": 1583202030.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcnjsh/robinhood_crash_conspiracy_theory/", "is_self": true}
