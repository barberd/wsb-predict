The fed holding the economy up like Atlas has given some of you bullcucks some false hope that stonks only go up.\n\n1. The coronavirus has just been proven to have the ability to invade the nervous systems of victims.\n   1.

You think the U.S. is willing to do that? No. There have been countries having their military driving huge ass trucks down streets while spraying aerosol-based \"sanitizers\" into the air trying to contain this shit. the U.S. will never do anything remotely close to that.\n3. It's now proven that the virus holds the ability to mutate. L-Cov, the deadlier and quicker-spreading one, is expected to be around 70% of cases. The U.S. is fucked.\n   1. [twitter.com/global...](https://twitter.com/globaltimesnews/status/1235094882915471365?s=19)\n4. LA just declared a temporary state of emergency. They are the first to do so. Imagine when other places begin to follow suit.\n   1. [twitter.com/bnodes...](https://twitter.com/bnodesk/status/1235243372283129856?s=21)\n5. The homelessness implications that nobody is talking about.\n   1.

If statistics are anything to go by, the U.S. is/has approached their 50 cases. It will soon explode. Note that these are statistics from countries that have actually \"tried\" to mitigate the spreading, the U.S. is putting an absolute abysmal amount of effort towards the beer virus. I imagine it'll get a lot worse pretty quickly.\n   1.

The Fed's Beige Book is showing first signs of the U.S. economy taking a hit from the virus.\n   1.

India is no longer shipping meds out in fear of a global shortage. Let me repeat that. India, one of the world's largest exporter of meds, is done exporting meds because **they fear there will be a global shortage.**\n   1. [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/04/india-limits-medicine-exports-coronavirus-paracetamol-antibiotics](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/04/india-limits-medicine-exports-coronavirus-paracetamol-antibiotics)\n\n\n10. Napkin math: U.S. death rate from the flu is .1%. Let's say (ignoring the fact that the coronavirus is much more quicker to spread) the infected numbers are the same. 34,000 deaths from the flu, on average, would mean 34,000,000 infected at a .1% death rate. 34,000,000 infected with the coronavirus would mean about 1 million deaths.\n\nIt\u2019s simply a matter of time before someone in power, or someone in the public eye, catches this boomer eliminator and the media freaks out. \n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr fed can't hold the economy up on these paper stilts for long.\n\nThis is only brief DD. The virus hasn't been portrayed accurately in the media for fear of spreading panic, but once it starts raking the country, specifically retirement homes, people will begin to notice it's nothing to scoff at.\n\nSPY 4/17 $250", "created_utc": 1583349461.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fdi3co/coronavirus_not_priced_in/", "is_self": true}
