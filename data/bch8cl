Total buying power reduction 1508 (Tastyworks)\n\nPut in $15k start next year with $25k. \n\nDo the mega bears tslaq spammers even think Tesla will go sub $150 by next year? I literally can't see how this isn't free money. If you're not bearish the @200 puts are $21 and only take 2k of buying power reduction (aka 2x your money).\n\nHow can this go tits up??? Seems way too good to be true other then waiting a fucking year.", "created_utc": 1555094738, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bch8cl/tsla_free_money_long_term_play/", "is_self": true}
