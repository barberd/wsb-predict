If you\u2019re doing it, chances are a lot of others are too!\n\nHere are a few examples of this working for me:\n\nNoticed I was going to McDonald\u2019s more, brought some stocks, it\u2019s up. Turns out I accidentally brought the dip too\n\nDad brought a TSLA, picked a few of thoughts up. He lives in the Isle of Man so I thought wow they must be getting big now, I was right. \n\nI gave up veganism last year, sold my BYND shares right at the top, worked amazing\n\nNoticed my office used Slack, got some shares on that. Right before earnings too, totally by accident. Worked great\n\nWhen you think about it, and he stock price just reflects how much use a company, so if you use it that must be a good thing", "created_utc": 1578646830, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/emoes4/new_type_of_dd_life_experience/", "is_self": true}
