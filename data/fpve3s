In the us another replacement sofr is up and running either way not important. Libor is blowing out and short term us treasury which are negative which means counter party risk in Asia or Europe(edit in both Asia and Europe both Libor and shibor are negative). Extremely bullish for the dollar. Swap lines (7 day) will be repaid and then auction back off this Monday and Tuesday which considering the uptake was double the size of biggest 1 day swap line auction at the height of 2008 (2008= 51 billion dollar swap from boj Monday and Tuesday both saw 100+ billion dollar swaps) another massively bullish indicator for the dollar. Lastly the infection rate because japan was trying to hide it is now creeping up. Options flows on $uup were 80% bullish the last two days. \nBUY EUO CALLS WAY OUT OF THE MONEY!\n\nOther side bet tesla is obviously on life support and the deliveries come out or should come out next Friday night I\u2019ll assume after market close.
