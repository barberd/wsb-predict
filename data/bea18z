{"id": "bea18z", "title": "PREDICTION: AAPL will acquire INTC\u2019s modem division/IP", "selftext": "This is 75% me hoping I still have a job, but hear me out:\n\nApple\u2019s known to be [opening a new office in San Diego](https://www.10news.com/news/local-news/apple-to-add-more-jobs-at-new-san-diego-tech-hub) to work on modems. While most news outlets have been reporting this is in Qualcomm\u2019s backyard, it\u2019s also in Intel\u2019s backyard - Intel\u2019s modem division (iCDG) is based out of SD.\n\nNow that [Intel is exiting the 5G smartphone business](https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/intel-modem-statement/), this allows Apple to swoop in and acquire the entire group, fast-tracking Apple\u2019s modem development. This deal with Qualcomm has bought Apple a six-year lifeline to develop their own modems, but six years may not be enough.\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re thinking \u201csix years is plenty of time to make their own!\u201d but modem development is not as simple as it sounds. Not only will Apple need to develop their own LTE/5G/NR modem, they will still need to support legacy RATs like 2G/3G/CDMA - not a trivial task. Why pour billions into R&amp;D to develop legacy tech, when they can just acquire? Intel\u2019s key customer has been Apple anyway, so both groups are familiar with working together and each other\u2019s methodology.\n\nWith Apple partnering with Qualcomm for the near future, but also trying to build their own modem, there\u2018s a risk for cross-contamination and more lawsuits, so acquiring Intel\u2019s modem division and operating them as their own unit would also alleviate these fears.\n\nThe only hiccup is Intel has specified they are only giving up *smartphone* 5G development. Would they be willing to give up their 5G IP even though they\u2019re still probably planning on putting 5G into laptops? Or will they come out and admit they\u2019re giving up on 5G modems all-together?\n\nThoughts?", "created_utc": 1555519505, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bea18z/prediction_aapl_will_acquire_intcs_modem/", "is_self": true}
