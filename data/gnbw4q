(\"Aphria\" or the \"Company\") (TSX: APHA and NYSE: APHA), a leading global cannabis company, today announced that it entered into privately negotiated agreements with a limited number of holders outside of Canada of its convertible senior notes (\"Notes\") to repurchase an aggregate of approximately $127.5 million ($90.8 million USD) principal amount of Notes for approximately 18.7 million of common shares and approximately $2.9 million ($2.1 million USD) in cash for accrued and unpaid interest.\"\n\nBasically over the last two weeks, these debtholders have either been selling their stock or lending it out to short sellers. We are getting to the point where this will clear.\n\nShort volume has been ~20-30% of intraday volume at an 80% borrow.\n\nThis thing has the potential to pop big.\n\nEDIT - The stock is artificially suppressed because of this dynamic - APHA's EV is half of ACB with way better financials.", "created_utc": 1589983392.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gnbw4q/apha_about_to_pull_an_acb/", "is_self": true}
