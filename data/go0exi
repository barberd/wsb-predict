I bought the VIX pretty low, and double my positions when it revisits the lows, sell half when it spikes, and repeat, not letting go of my TVIX to avoid a wash sale. Same for my straddles. I sell one leg of my strategy when it goes up, and the rest when it goes down and repeat the straddle (while looking at charts to help me determine when to sell). At the same time, I\u2019m completely ignoring all the stocks I\u2019ve bought along the way. Have had more winners than losers, but my strategy seems to be working. No bulls or bears bullshit, just trying to beat the market.", "created_utc": 1590079730.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/go0exi/what_has_been_your_winning_strategy/", "is_self": true}
