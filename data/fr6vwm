Because they already know the situation(SNAFU?) well so there's no need for proactive testing? So they are only doing case-by-case diagnostic testing from now on?\n\nAlso WFT is this 50%? So if you live in NYC area and have flu-like symptoms then your chance of COVID-19 is 50-50? Are we at this point already?\n\nPlus Trump and Cuomo already rejected the Wuhan model, then that basically leaves NYC on the trajectory of a runaway?\n\nIs it really this bad or am I just retarded?\n\nAdditional: https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/baffling-coronavirus-map-keeps-nyc-dark\n\nEDIT: SPY 220P 5/1 assholes!", "created_utc": 1585492921.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fr6vwm/50_tests_are_positive_in_nyc_n18854_week_of/", "is_self": true}
