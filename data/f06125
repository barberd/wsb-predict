This may seem like another bio that sold the news but that doesn\u2019t appear to be the case. The short interest on aimt is one of the highest on the market standing at 27-30%. And AH the stock rocketed 20% only to be shorted to oblivion on the thesis that dillution would be necessary to launch approval. This fear was put to rest recently by massive 200 million cash infusion by nestle in common and preferred stock made effective tomorrow, in addition to a loan already received. Aimt has pt double the current sp and imo is a ticking time bomb for the shorts. don\u2019t know when it will happen but once commercialization begins in about 2 weeks and a good earnings call, this can send this to the 65$ pt it rightfully deserves personally extended my 2/21 calls to March", "created_utc": 1581053768, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f06125/aimt_isnt_over/", "is_self": true}
