{"id": "fkqsfl", "title": "SHOPIFY - Short this biatch?", "selftext": "Shopify (SHOP) is a platform which lets you easily create your own online store.  You bring the domain, they do the hosting, website builder, payments, etc.\n\nI took a look at what types of products are for sale on Shopify.  As I recall, most people I hear talking about Shopify are dropshipping shit from Alibaba at massive markups.  Most of it is garbo.  Here's a list compiled by Shopify themselves (multiple of them are phone cases):\n\n[https://www.shopify.com/blog/shopify-stores](https://www.shopify.com/blog/shopify-stores)\n\nI'm also intrigued by Shopify's Price -> Sales ratio (27).  Shopify has a market cap of about $40.5 Billion USD on sales of $1.5 Billion USD.  That's not profit boys, that's sales.  Their Net Income in 2019 was -$125M USD.\n\nSo, is this a serious Putter?  On the basis of their business model being highly competitive, full of non-essential products, and massive Price-Sales ratio?  Let me know.  Also are there any other companies with ridiculous Price-Sales ratios that you have your eye on?  LMK.\n\nSHOP 160P July 17", "created_utc": 1584543374.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkqsfl/shopify_short_this_biatch/", "is_self": true}
