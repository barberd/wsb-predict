Granted I'm biased, I may have a overly positive view of the company due to the monies it already made for me. \nAccouding to E-Trade's analyst, They projecting 12 months  $126 -$130 range. Its current  $112.\n\nThey just beat their quarterly earnings projection, albeit the profit is down, but thats a an issue that is fixable. Its easier to keep ground then it is to gain ground. \n\nI'm thinking of doing $5000 for short term. \n\nBut all the monies I have made was pure luck. So far I've Net ~ $3000. $5000 would be more then twice my largest bet, so I'm trying to pair up my recent luck with big brain time. \n\nSomebody tell me why I shouldn't.", "created_utc": 1572569824, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpx31w/someone_convince_me_not_to_invest_heavy_in_wm/", "is_self": true}
