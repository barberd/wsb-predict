{"id": "f90ui5", "title": "Speculative Stocks are the Safest Bets", "selftext": "You've seen the shitposting about there being no Corona virus in Space, but theres a grain of truth to the insanity.\n\nThe Corona virus will have effects on the stocks of whatever people believe would be affected by manufacturing disruption, especially in the short term.\n\nThe average investor in this situation will turn to gold, bonds, ect. to \"ride out\" the downturn. This is one of the more stupid strategies for a projected short term disruption.\n\nA temporary disruption is the best time to move over to speculative stocks which have a timeline outside that of the projected effects of the disruption. For a viral outbreak, that effect will be estimated by most people to be no more than a couple of months, getting past flu season.\n\nYou may have noticed SPCE went up today, and wondered why. I honestly think only part of that was optimism about the upcoming press conference and ER, and more people recognizing that a viral outbreak primarily concentrated in Asia will have zero effect on the estimated value of a North American based, vertically integrated aerospace company who wont be launching for several more months by most estimates.\n\nSimilarly, you could look at Pharmaceuticals who are looking for FDA approval several months in the future, small cap tech based in Europe or North America with projects still in development. \n\nTLDR: Dont be a bear, just be a smart bull. Stonks only go up, but not all of them go up at the same time.", "created_utc": 1582588692, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f90ui5/speculative_stocks_are_the_safest_bets/", "is_self": true}
