{"id": "g8kv7c", "title": "WSB Research Recruiting Thread 2", "selftext": "Welp, it's been a while since my last post here. That's probably for the best. I can only tolerate you ignorant, degenerate fucks for short periods of time.\n\nSince u/fuzzyblankeet is too busy simping for u/pokimane to join us, I'm left to post another recruitment thread for our organization.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few updates: we've since eliminated TA as a team, and our remaining TA guys currently run predictions on the weekly for trading purposes (since we're all still actively trading). Macro and Fundamentals have been merged because of significant overlap in work assignments. Developers have been loosely split into devs proper and data scientists. We now have a project management website where work is assigned and uploaded.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRight now, we have an API built for querying the SEC EDGAR engine and scraping N-PORT files. We need someone to help us build a front end for serving and visualizing the data, as well as a dev well-versed in MS Azure, and/or someone with specific experience working with the EDGAR API to help us tweak our tool on the back end for other forms of financial reports (of primary interest are 10-Ks). C# knowledge is a plus. Additionally, we need data scientists and machine learning guys to build a predictive tool that can analyze data from financial reports.\n\nNaturally, we also need financial analysts to inform the design of both the scraper and the risk assessor we're working on: ideally, someone(s) with finance or accounting experience who's very comfortable reading financial reports and holistically evaluating the financial health of a firm. Credit/debt analysis (esp debt covenants), securities, and ETF experience are all a plus. Bloomberg/Reuters access, really, really big plus.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to make it very clear to anyone interested that if we invite you, you will be expected to participate regularly in standups. Inactivity will get you removed. Also, a few people who've left us have been disheartened by a lack of direction and organization. We've only just recently begun to adopt tools that allow us to assign work and store it in a central location (our site) and track participation. We had also been waiting for dev team to finish and make available the scraper - and it's up now. Honestly, that's a hell of a milestone, if I'm allowed to brag a bit on our group's behalf.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe have some pretty lofty long-term goals for what we're working towards, and it's been a bumpy few weeks, but trying to marshal WSB autists toward a singular objective is like herding fucking cats. Because of waning participation from new members, we're going to keep the group pretty small from now on. We've made significant progress already, and I can't wait to see what we can accomplish in the next few months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDM me (not message) for more information. Give me some background (credentials, relevant experience, etc) and personal goals in trading, and I'll go into more detail about our intentions with this project. We're going to be much more selective this time 'round, with likely less than a dozen invited.\n\nCheers, gents,\n\njoe\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: yeah i'll probably repost this again later as well on account of low traffic right now", "created_utc": 1587929858.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g8kv7c/wsb_research_recruiting_thread_2/", "is_self": true}
