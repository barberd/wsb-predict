{"id": "dyptod", "title": "YPF?", "selftext": "So I've been thinking about investing in YPF, the government run petroleum company in Argentina. I know it seems retarded to invest in Argentina given the current climate but hear me out. The incoming government will invest heavily in Argentine petroleum, they've said so before and the Vaca Muerta fields are actually pretty promising. Also, I'd invest around December 10 when Argentine stocks will tank since the incoming president is seen very negatively by the international market. Am I crazy or maybe on to something?", "created_utc": 1574193726, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dyptod/ypf/", "is_self": true}
