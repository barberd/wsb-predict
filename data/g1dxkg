This is seriously the most boring post so far.", "selftext": "Previous post:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0sq2x/more\\_tea\\_leaves\\_less\\_palm\\_reading\\_long\\_boring/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0sq2x/more_tea_leaves_less_palm_reading_long_boring/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo; My morning gap theory was correct, as were my movement timelines, though my assumption that we might get a minor gap down was reversed. This really should not have surprised me, given that the stock market doesn't operate on news, but rather expectation. What do I mean by this?\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-better-than-feared-news-morning-brief-111215949.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-better-than-feared-news-morning-brief-111215949.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSimply put, the market doesn't care about the dead, as long as they're predictable. Same for the earnings report, which is why we should have predicted a slight rise instead of a slight fall. We've been hearing about how bad the earnings report will be all week, which means the market has heard this too. If the models match, :stonks go up:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPre-market we've seen quite a bit of what I believe to be institutional manipulation. The pre and post hours on the market are largely operated by the industry professionals and institutions. End of day, we typically see market order drawdown and consolidation, a 'cleanup' if you will This makes sense. In the mornings, we're seeing regular large gaps up and down. Jump to the 1H chart, and zoom out.\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/1112/trading-in-the-pre--and-post-market-sessions.aspx](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/1112/trading-in-the-pre--and-post-market-sessions.aspx)\n\nMarch 24th: 8pt jump, 226-234 over night.\n\nMarch 26th: 9 pt jump, 263-254\n\nAPR 1: 254-249\n\nAPR 6: 247-257\n\nAPR  7: 266-274\n\nLast night, \\~2pt jump, so fairly small, in the scope of things.\n\nNow, there are plenty of nights without gaps, and plenty of gapping in the real world. What is questionable is what these frequent and consistent gaps might represent. Retail investors (thats us) are considered the 'dumb money' of the market, that is, we give away our cash for free because we're idiots. Largely, I believe this to be true. Operating on phrases like \"unemployment reportzzzzzzz\" and \"quarterly earningsssss\", its no surprise that we're often left surprised when the market barely reacts to bad news. How these gaps might be manipulation, is my speculation on artificial stock inflation. Stock price operates on a fairly simple concept, I offer/ask at X price, and you reject/accept. Generally speaking, these prices ladder up and down as we negotiate the new prices, and a record of how we got to a price exists. Where there are no records, is in a gap. We go from 247 one day to 257 the next day, based on nothing. That suggests there is no support for these numbers, but if we lock in the price a bit during pre-market, the market frequently accepts these new numbers without any reason other than 'group think'. After all, if that guy sells his stock for way more today than yesterday, and nothing new has happened since yesterday, seems totally legit that I made 10 million tendies overnight. Stonks only go up!\n\nWhat I believe is happening is a simple pump and dump, using small volume orders in the pre-market to inflate/deflate prices, and leave retail investors as bag holders.\n\nCompany A - Hey, I have 100,000 shares of XYZ. Buy 10k of my shit today at $10.\n\nCompany B - Ok, now you buy it back for $11.\n\nCompany A - Ok, now we do it again for $12\n\nCompany B - Ok, Now to 13.\n\nRetail D$ - Hey, look at this stock, its trending up! I better get in on this. Stonks only go up! $14.\n\nRetail M$ - $15! Stonks only go up!\n\nCompany A - Hey B, sell our extra shares at $15. We'll get mad tendies.\n\nRetail D$ - Oh god! it was a bubble, sell sell! $10\n\nCompany B - Hey, now that we sold, the stock is back to $10. What now?\n\nRetail M$ - Hrm. this was a shitty deal, I should get out before I lose more money.\n\nCompany A - I'll buy those back from you for $9 so you can cut your losses.\n\nRetail M$ - Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\n\nCompany A - Sell 10k more shares for 8.50.\n\nRetail M$ - Now they're only $8! Ok I'll sell.\n\nCompany A - Buys stocks back up to $10-11 dollars.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCompany A & B take long positions on a stock, inflate the price, and then take up a position shorting the stock.  The dumb money sees the run, and tries to get on board. The run was never real, and Company A & B use the opportunity to get out of their position for a profit. The bag holders eat the loss, and then company A & B can purchase back their original shares, netting a nice little profit from the retail investors without giving anything in return. Company profits on every leg of the interaction, retail is left confused about Quarterly earnings and dead corona numbers. Using the market to draw money out of 'dumb money'. Retail D$ and M$ were only really ever competing against each other, this is important to realize if the thesis is correct. You're not going to beat JP Morgan in the long run, but you might beat the other retail guys. That's the edge to play.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe reality is that the internet brings us faster and better communications everyday, so \"unexpected\" happens less and less. When things are operating within the bounds of expected, the market reacts as you'd expect. If you take our gap last night into account when looking at the days movements, we've barely moved, with a slight incline. This follows our original prediction to a tee, that there was no unexpected news, so the markets trended up in general.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis comment here, if I'm understanding correctly, suggests some interesting theories that support our thesis that anyone using this newer accounting documentation requirement will be more stable predictions going forward, which again will lead to less \"crashing\" than bears would like. I think this is probably the most important post of the day for understanding short term numbers.

This of course, continues to not include the fuckery that is \"under employed\" \"sorta employed\" and \"I gave up on this shit and started making meth in an RV in the mountains employed\".\n\nIf you need an idea of what the fed thinks, consider that there were 1.75t in federal spending to dig out of 2008-12, starting with an estimate of 700b. So far as we've gone thru this, I've eyeballed minimum 10 trillion estimated, as in, only whats being spent right now. Obviously we don't know what we'll have to spend next year, yet. Its not even comparable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLets look at another good reference number. Number of corporate bankruptcies.\n\n[https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/current-trends-in-china-s-bankruptcy-49571/](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/current-trends-in-china-s-bankruptcy-49571/)\n\n[https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3078581/coronavirus-nearly-half-million-chinese-companies-close-first](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3078581/coronavirus-nearly-half-million-chinese-companies-close-first)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, 8500+ in 2018, lets be nice and double it, call it 17k. 460k in the first 2 months of 2020? Someone told China that those were rookie numbers, so they got em up there. Remember, China is a manufacturing powerhouse in the world. They generate revenue by producing content, and manufacturing is \\*generally\\* more resilient, you know, as long as people can actually work. The service industry? How many of you have related in your life to \"Ok, got my paycheck, now I can pay last weeks bills, I'll just take care of this week with next weeks paycheck, and I can put friday night on the credit card\". This is in effect, how the service industry functions. This is also why nothing has hit yet. We're paying last weeks bills, but next week(metaphor)  we're boned.\n\nGDP By sector:\n\n[https://www.indexmundi.com/china/gdp\\_composition\\_by\\_sector.html](https://www.indexmundi.com/china/gdp_composition_by_sector.html)\n\n[https://www.indexmundi.com/united\\_states/gdp\\_composition\\_by\\_sector.html](https://www.indexmundi.com/united_states/gdp_composition_by_sector.html)\n\nComparison of Service vs Industry economies and their abilities to withstand shock.\n\n[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ijfe.1658](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ijfe.1658)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInterestingly, the world as a whole is undergoing the same depression, at the same time. The implications from what I can tell will be that cash rich countries that don't care about people (Saudi Arabia, China) should weather this fairly well, and potentially come out better (in world influence ranking) than they were before. I would expect the United states and Large portions of the EU to weather this fairly poorly. As usual, no one cares what South America or Africa does (just kidding, sorta.)\n\nSo what does that mean for us today? Well, until we have reason, we stick to the model. Stocks should continue to rise slightly / slowly, with small retractions unless there is a catalyst. If the fed is able to slow the the housing market crash, it will likely be a long slow bleed. This is a reasonable goal for them that we have to consider in our future models, as we'd try and do the same.  Our assumption is that the mortgage default rate will outweigh the ability of the fed to keep it from crashing us, and we expect the Fed to let small to medium companies fail in large quantities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: I wrote jobs report instead of earnings report because I'm dumb.
