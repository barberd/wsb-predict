{"id": "gkd7s4", "title": "$MARK - Walmart, Disney, other big names are partnering with this AI Based Thermal Imaging company", "selftext": "Remark Holdings Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:\u00a0MARK) is flying in the market today, and it\u2019s nothing new. For several trading sessions, the stock has traded on either single, or double-digit gains.\nThe gains started when the company announced that it started shipping AI based thermal imaging technology to customers in the United States and Japan about two weeks ago. Recent evidence shows that one of these customers may be\u00a0Walmart Inc\u00a0(NYSE:\u00a0WMT), but there\u2019s much more to this than Walmart. [article](https://alphastocknews.com/remark-holdings-mark-stock-theres-more-to-it-than-walmart/3352/)\n\nDD done by \u201cInformed Observer\u201d\n\nMARK remains in default on $11.9MM of debt owed to MGG which delivered its notice of acceleration to the Company on March 16. The 30 day period to cure the default ends tomorrow. MARK is likely able to meet this obligation under the terms of its $30MM Common Stock Purchase Agreement with Aspire Capital Fund (signed April 9, 2020); however, it comes at the cost of additional dilution for shareholders, particularly in the context of MARK\u2019s intrinsic value.\n\nMARK is also in the process of resolving the risk that it is delisted from the NASDAQ for failure to maintain a $1.00 per share valuation for a ninety day period. The requirement for curing the notice of delisting is for MARK\u2019s shares to close above $1.00 per share for 10 consecutive trading days, before, by my estimate, the 22nd of May.\n\nThe resolution of these two controversies remove two important catalysts which have been central to the short seller thesis and is likely to contribute to short covering.\n\nThe Company still has to finish its 2019 audit and it is unclear to me; Covid notwithstanding, why this has taken so long since the sale of the Company\u2019s Vegas.com was completed in May 2019. The good news is that MARK\u2019s auditor has not resigned and the Company\u2019s past audits have been qualified with \u201cgoing concern\u201d risk language, so at this point the auditor\u2019s opinion letter can\u2019t get much worse\u2026.unless they refuse to provide an opinion\u2026which should already have been announced if it was going to happen.\n\nAs we get closer to MARK\u2019s restated Q4 and FY 2019 10-K filing and update call on Thursday, May 28\u2026.market focus will shift to the contents and substance of the Company\u2019s narrative regarding the status of its KanKan AI business with particular emphasis on names of clients and the size of contacts and the implications for twelve month revenues and cash flow. There has been a lot of speculation on these issues in the past three weeks, much of it informed by the Company\u2019s own tweets, which is a business practice that many appropriately believe hurts the organization\u2019s credibility.\n\nMARK management needs to be clear and precise on their call on the 28th about the status, size, and duration of contracts (even if NDAs prevent them from naming clients) and provide investors with 12 month revenue and margin guidance, Open-ended statements about the scope of the thermal imaging and AI opportunity (as they have done on past calls when talking about the China business) without reference to real contracts is insufficient given the Company\u2019s Twitter teases about Wynn, Simon Property Group, (Disney or was there a different source?) et al. The call needs to expand upon, not regurgitate, the substance of the Company\u2019s rare and effective official statement of April 30.\n\nIt is hard to know the number of outstanding MARK shares at the moment but reasonable to assume that it is markedly higher than the 55.1MM last reported on September 30, 2019. Nevertheless, the value of MARK\u2019s investment in ShareCare (which remains impaired by MarK\u2019s default on the MGG loan) has appreciated by more (based on the revaluation of the telehealth sector which is up 60-80% with the outbreak of Covid-19) than the increase in MARK\u2019s share count (which has a share cap of 20% under the Aspire Agreement).\n\nThe value of the ShareCare investment (once unencumbered by MGG\u2019s lien) likely supports a MARK share price that is 2-3X MARK\u2019s current share price. The value on the KanKan AI business and any contracts that the Company has secured in the last six months (or will secure in the next six months) is all incremental to the value of MARK. Uncertainties remain over the next several days; however, their resolution and the fact that MARK will own the narrative thereafter (and may actually announce contracts), creates an attractive set-up and demands attention.", "created_utc": 1589562879.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gkd7s4/mark_walmart_disney_other_big_names_are/", "is_self": true}
