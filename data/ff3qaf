Definitely short positions for the next month however watch buy/sells and RSI for early signs of reversal especially if some news catalysts is involved. If nothing changes expect a short uptrend, descent to 289, another short uptrend and then a final downtrend to a range between 260-280. Time frame could accelerate significantly with negative news catalysts but the targets will likely remain the same.\n\nFor the Retards: SPY 289p 3/22 SPY SPY 260 5/22\n\n\\[Chart\\]([https://imgur.com/gzxmoyu](https://imgur.com/gzxmoyu))\n\n\\[Buy/Sell Data\\]([https://imgur.com/RcG0aOu](https://imgur.com/RcG0aOu))\n\nAnyone with more experience than me at TA in bear markets wanna chime in?", "created_utc": 1583624324.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ff3qaf/spy_targets_289p_322_26080p_522/", "is_self": true}
