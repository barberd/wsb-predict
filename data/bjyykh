{"id": "bjyykh", "title": "Am I missing something about ATVI?", "selftext": "As you probably ATVI is going to present their Q1 numbers for 2019. Last earningsreport they said that they\u00b4re expecting net revenue of 1,715 million $ and a GAAP eps of 0.39$. Today I looked them up on earningswhisper. The consensus for the earnings are revenue of  1,240 million $ and eps of 0.25$-0.28$. Of course a company can miss their guidance but not by that much ?\n\nThis all seems to good to be true so I probably oversaw something.
