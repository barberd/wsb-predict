The options have ridiculous premium though so I'm long stock and a smaller amount of calls (28 strike with Friday expiration) than I wanted but will look at getting more tomorrow. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEarnings are tomorrow. Pre-Covid they fired their CEO/founder and announced a restructuring. They are dumping their consumer goods business because it made up much of their expense and not enough of their revenue. Their plan was to focus on services and experiences, because that is most profitable and they have high market share there. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPre-Covid the stock got hammered but if you look at past earnings, they were able to squeak out some profit. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe reason to make this play is their relative high cash and low debt position. Before they did a 20:1 reverse split last week their stock was bouncing around $1.25-$1.50, yet there is a much smaller chance they go bankrupt than most companies that were struggling pre-Covid. Look at their cash to market cap ratio. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey are positioned to realize on pent up demand of people looking to do stuff after being cooped up and the capitalize on the need for business to get revenue however they can. A business can sell a Groupon and book a lot of revenue ahead of providing the service. They do have to carry it as a liability but it would think a lot of businesses see going the discount route as a way to survive for better times. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCovid offered an excuse to do massive layoffs. They will come out of this very lean. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey will most certainly be posting a loss but I think anything not terrible is good news and it could moon. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer: this is not financial advice.
