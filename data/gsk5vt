{"id": "gsk5vt", "title": "Verizon DD", "selftext": "Post been removed every time posted. Remove as you please not posting again this is my final dd post on this company... use as you please.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPrevious  posts what I have been talking about is that I look for oversold stocks with major catalysts coming up near term. Verizon had exactly that Friday. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[1 month VZ](https://preview.redd.it/ag21nod5yl151.png?width=789&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9e236a3bcb1426dbab4627720309205caa497f4)\n\nAs you can see Verizon has had a bearish trend after running up a bit after march. Being oversold for no reason when multiple catalysts are coming up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Comparing with TMUS and T**\n\nT has been downgraded to hell recently and has no near term catalysts.\n\nTmus has not been upgrades at all and has some catalysts but the stock is not oversold so more risk to pullbacks.\n\nVerizon has recently reputable analyst upgrades \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Upgrades recently](https://preview.redd.it/bxisjvymyl151.png?width=1433&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8f010741e7df52d7f4ff3d0580e10302993fdc0)\n\nAlso another bullish sentiment is that hedge funds are increasing positions more than ever before in Verizon. \n\n [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-funds-never-bullish-verizon-175738734.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-funds-never-bullish-verizon-175738734.html) \n\nAlways bullish to have smart and big money on your side autists. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Expansion of 5 compared to competitors.**\n\nAlready ruling out T as a competitor as we rule out their pretty shit. Real 2 are TMUS and VZ. Both can flourish as well keep that in mind. \n\nLots of articles on VZ main focus keeping 5G expansion as number one priority which should be. \n\n [https://www.barrons.com/articles/t-mobile-continues-to-outpace-at-t-verizon-now-the-focus-turns-to-sprint-and-5g-51588802443?siteid=yhoof2](https://www.barrons.com/articles/t-mobile-continues-to-outpace-at-t-verizon-now-the-focus-turns-to-sprint-and-5g-51588802443?siteid=yhoof2) \n\nreal kicker now :) Tmus isn't as focused on 5G as Verizon hence why this opportunity is so bullish. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLots of Cash per share\n\nMore cash per share than TMUS which allows for more heavy expansion. Also better profit margins allowing for more money to be made blah blah\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TECHNICAL TIME** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Techys ](https://preview.redd.it/jnalfscvzl151.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=4691b1f300e990b8118e88d7c758d7370c3af4f6)\n\n1st thing to note is we see a VWAP and MACD crossover coming up. Not something to base a trade on but something to solidify your thesis and position. If I did DD yesterday would have went heavy today. You can see first support got CROSSED today. Meaning smart money and people know this is oversold. Wake up people! Oversold stock with major catalysts approaching with a strong balance sheet.\n\nTalking about finances... another bullish sentiment. Debt securities to be redeemed June 15th\n\n [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-redeem-debt-securities-june-062725915.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-redeem-debt-securities-june-062725915.html) \n\nFor you autists means of a way to pay off debt or interest on debt. \n\n [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/future-5g-now-samsung-galaxy-163010245.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/future-5g-now-samsung-galaxy-163010245.html)  \\-exclusive to VERIZON\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DOWNFALLS**\n\nI don't see any downfalls unless market crashes. Does not look like it as unemployment is slowly decreasing. Also something for you autists to know. People LIQUIDATED their portfolio during March. People did not lose their portfolio value, they are loaded in cash. People will keep on entering out of FOMO and new variables. I do not see market crashing like that again... especially not till July 30th which gets into second leg of trade\n\n**Back to good and upsies**\n\nEarnings July 30th which means if trade fucks up because not everybody is right all the time nor an oracle... IV boost will be able to help you get out of the trade. Highly unlikely but always nice to buy time. If u enter buy AT LEAST TILL SEPTEMBER\n\nI only have January calls 57.5 and 60 as I sold everything else yesterday thinking VZ was moving on Spy, but today that changed as VZ kept keeping green even though market sell off at 3-4. \n\nWill be looking to add tmr at a decent entry price. Price entry is KEY. Will make a follow up post/post when I'm entering and what I'm buying because some of you autists need hand holding. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Am I retarded?**\n\nA little but your call\n\nMY REPUTATION: Have had some good and bad trades like all which I posted on WSB.\n\nGood: EROS (600% on merger) Abeo(100 percent on oversold due to corona) Selling TWLO puts( 100 percent because TWLO gapped 40 percent on earnings). TWTR earnings runup( sold before earnings at 100 percent gain). \n\nBAD: Selling Roku puts ( got out with 20 percent loss even though earnings were bad. If you play earnings always write the options. ZOM( but posted as a joke and sold my position right after taking the screen shot)- it was obv a joke but I will count it as an L. CPB CALLS( my thesis was wrong and I admit it was a bad trade. Hit my stop loss at 50 percent loss but know people who did not sell and now options are worthless... I'm sorry for that. I did not do enough DD and went in knowing low volume on options. Everyone makes mistakes in trading. Never a perfect game. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: Oversold stock with major catalysts. Both technicals and fundamentals look good to push share price of stock.** \n\n**57.5 and 60 jan calls. Will add tmr and post when I enter and which specific calls I'm buying for those that need to be spoon-fed.**", "created_utc": 1590719047.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gsk5vt/verizon_dd/", "is_self": true}
