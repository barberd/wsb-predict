You\u2019ve seen how gold moves when it wants to.\n\nSo here\u2019s our line up:\n\n1. Does the Fed cut rates in July?\nMy answer: yes, a full .50 basis points\nThis would be the biggest win for gold. I\u2019m talking kissing 1475 for /GC good alone on this. This is worth waiting for, lots of good reward here.\n\n2. Does GDP and job numbers suck again?\nI think at best they will be luke warm, but possibly they can be shitty again. They won\u2019t be bang buster good.\n\n3. \ud83d\udc32 G-20: This one is a bit of a wild card. I know for a fact a deal will not be made, and optimism will cease from this, but I\u2019m not sure if we will see a rally in gold? Possibly we can benefit from this from $DXY falling, which is good for gold. I\u2019m not sure how fueling this event will be, even though we should favor from it as gold gang.\n\n4. We could benefit from a market sell off any day lol. \n\n5. Were holding above 1400 like a champ. So the smart money is still here, consolidation is happening, so that\u2019s good for us.\n\nI\u2019m down 10k but still holding, not advising anyone to do the same, just saying this where I\u2019m at. \ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83c\udf3e", "created_utc": 1561672022, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c6bjc7/gold_gang_discussion/", "is_self": true}
