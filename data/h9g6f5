But here's what I'm going to do for all your clowns to make sure you get a clear picture of how this next crash is going to look so that you don't cash out your measly profits when shit doesn't go your way for a little while. And if you're reading this and you don't think it's going down--oh, yes it fucking is. It's going down harder than the WSB mods' moms on Warren Buffet's wizened cock. \n\nThis is a picture of the absolutely absurd rally in SPY we just experienced since we bottomed out in march:\n\n[I know, It Doesn't Make Any Goddamned Sense](https://preview.redd.it/tto5r5ngp2551.png?width=2380&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d3981a2d9039f56beb2caff97ada7de1d12be76)\n\nHere's a picture of that rally flipped upside down and haphazardly glued on as a future projection:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[If You Know Anything about TA, This is the Fucking Gospel](https://preview.redd.it/6zqcsd6wp2551.png?width=1952&format=png&auto=webp&s=290e58fe1dccc430824143e70401d3e4e53a402c)\n\nAs you can clearly see from how it fits the current drop so far, this is exactly what's going to happen. So in the next day or two we're going to drop down to the low 290's to touch the 50 SMA but then bounce idiotically upward, conceivably all the way back to the 310's. You might want to close out your puts early in the week to look for better prices on that bounce, because after that (probably next week) it's going to dump spectacularly, noodle around in an annoying range for a few weeks and then dump again. \n\nSPY 8/21 270p\n\nYou're welcome, idiots.", "created_utc": 1592227070.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h9g6f5/that_real_ta_what_goes_up_must_come_down/", "is_self": true}
