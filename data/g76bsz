I\u2019ve been using for \u201cprofessionals\u201d whatever the gay monster trucks that is. \n\nI.e. professionals can track 150 symbols max\n\nStreetSmart, Trade Source, Schwab mobile,StreetSmart edge yet nothing fucking works. I can\u2019t even get my watchlist from edge to anything else. I was told to download it to my computer, yet the sync feature remains. Yeah whatever they have a cool amex. This website is gayer than having Charles written on every fucking credit card on cursive Piece of shit platform designed BY AND FOR BOOMERS  to index and lose all their money after working their whole life. It\u2019s whatever they lived a good life right and so did fucking schwab.\n\n\n\n\nI feel like there sole purpose is to make trading as difficult as possible so you can have their intelligently \u201cgay\u201d portfolio. \n\n\nSeriously, sometimes I see Mr. Charles behind his screen screen sharing as I attempts to through my daily task of finding new features that I will never see again. This is when I started crying as I had  42 windows open and my options turned worthless. My face was angry and aggressive as I realized that I heard someone\u2019s say \u201cexpirreeeeddddd\u201d. I glanced toward my computer as StreetSmart edge doesn\u2019t usually groan to me normally, but I thought okay its just a new feature................. I was dead wrong. .there he was staring at me through StreetSmartedge\u2019s \u201call-in-one\u201d trade tool, it was him, Charlie Schwab , slowing down my computer long enough so he can bust as I do my OTMSLUT dance for him as I have more tendies worthless\n\n\nHey Charles, where the fuck is my watchlist syncing to because my list is saying \u201cBlackGurL_Pizza2020watchlist\u201d and I\u2019m now watching just DIS.\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: someone make king Vlad buy this garbage truck before I short  5,000,000 shares stating it wasn\u2019t me it was one of the websites idk which one. That will fool the 24 year old, level 9 options trader behind the phone.\n\n\nI don\u2019t know coding but I know that you gotta have pythons and I got two. So for the next couple months can you just pm whenever you see this and lemme try to be as autistic as the current developer. Can\u2019t promise a maximum of  \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f on the App Store but I can damn sure try. This new feature is called \u201cfill or song\u201d and if your order doesn\u2019t fill you can just connect your iTunes account now and play your favorite song.
