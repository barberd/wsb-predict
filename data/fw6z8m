Learn how to straddle.", "selftext": "I'm sick of seeing loss after loss here because most of you are too stupid to learn what a straddle is. The reason there's so much options activity right now in r/wallstreetbets is because people know there are huge swings to be profited from right now, right? Then that's exactly what you should bet on - the SWING not the direction of the swing. This is so simple it defies my personal ability to stay silent, so many of you idiots need to learn this.\n\nIf your gut reaction to what I just wrote is that a straddle isn't \"YOLO\" enough for you, then STFU you are wrong. You can still make unlimited tendies.\n\nIf you want to make money on volatility instead of betting on the direction of a swing, then you should create an ATM Straddle. In other words, enter (buy in my example) an equal amount of put and call options that have the same strike price (ATM) and same expiration date. What you are betting on now is that one will be worthless and the other will make enough tendies to not only make up for the premium you paid for the worthless option, but also profit, **which you will in this market**.\n\nIf you aren't completely retarded and can use your head for a couple of minutes, you can implicitly see that there are TWO different break even points with my straddle example. One of the  breakeven prices would be the equity price at which the call option value makes up for lost premium from the put (stonk went up) and the other breakeven would be the equity price at which the put option makes up for the value of the call's premium (stonk went down).\n\nYou do not need any special clearance from Robinhood to do this. You don't need to guess whether the market goes up or down anymore. And you can sell them whenever you want, keep an eye on them often and take a profit you're comfortable with. $SPY is preferable because of volume and you don't need to deal with shittier bid/ask spreads.\n\n$SPY $265 Apr 22p + $SPY $265 Apr 22c", "created_utc": 1586206997.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fw6z8m/want_to_be_smarter_than_99_of_this_sub_learn_how/", "is_self": true}
