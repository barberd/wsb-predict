Not really a growth, just kinda there. \nAre there not just in the restaurant business? I know they keep the land of their franchises or something like that, but I\u2019m not getting it. \nAsking that question because I\u2019m getting an equity cost of 6.77% and my LFCF DCF is giving me $104 and my dividend model is giving me something like 129, and even that is bending some things. Can anyone tell me where the extra money is? \n(Yes tendies I know)", "created_utc": 1552514580, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b0s12i/mcds_valuation/", "is_self": true}
