I understand that options are decaying assets but how does theta affect option prices in practice? Let's say for example you have a weekly 190 long call QQQ valued at 0.01 and the theta is - 0.25, does that mean that for now theta as no effect on the value of the option since you can't go lower than 0.01 (until it increase in value, and then the theta could affect the price)?\n\nWouldn't that also mean that buying an option priced at 0.30 would be dumb, because the next day it would be valued at 0.05 (subtracted the theta and assuming for the example sakes that they have fairly same theta) and you would need a 500% to beak even, whereas the option mentioned above would require less of a move to get break even. \n\nAlso does theta affects prices at close, at opening or during the day? As in, does the - 0.25 gets subtracted from the option value every day?", "created_utc": 1554243115, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b8ppy7/how_does_theta_works_exactly/", "is_self": true}
