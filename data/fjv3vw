Get ready for a roller coaster becuz we goin to da moooon.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Play - Cheapest Dollar General Puts\n\n5/15 90p, 5/15 95p\n\n6/19 100p, 6/19 95p, 6/19 90p\n\nNow why these puts? Bc Dollar general puts are expensive A FFFF (honestly just get any)\n\nNow as Big Daddy Trump is clapping his cheeks on my puts, let me give you some background.\n\nSure things at Dollar Trees are generally cheap and we all like cheap as we try to fucking stockpiling our houses like we\u2019re going to roleplay as Anne Frank. But fucking hell, they don\u2019t even sell the cheapest things. Dollar\u2019s tree 0.79 cents a can for canned Happy Harvest Green Beans sound cheap af, tll you learn that it\u2019s more than twice as expensive than Aldi\u2019s 0.36$ version. Similar examples for chips, spice, baking soda, etc. Did I mention that even if you get the goods, they could be faulty. They have repeatedly been fined by OSHA for safety hazards and shit products. Hey it\u2019s made mostly in China am I right? It\u2019s so bad that of the 72 inspections of Dollar Generals nationwide, over half (39) of them have resulted in citations. At least if you want a cheap way to get robo-tripping while wanking with the free monies you are about to get from this play you can get cheap drugs at Dollar General. Oh wait, they got fined not too long ago for selling expired drugs.\n\nNow the faggots who just do a cursory google search and find articles that \u201cDollar Stores are doing well in general despite Corona Viruses\u201d, \u201cRetail stores are doing alright despite the recession\u201d are gonna get screwed hard. Listen here, Dollar General is part of the SPY 500 bois and we all know that is gonna go down harder than your mother did after I made it rain Benjamins.\n\nDollar General has done some stuff to try to limit their sourcing exposure to only China. They actually have laid the foundation for efforts in Mexico, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Southeast Asian companies such as, \\*cough\\* India \\*cough\\* since last year. Guess what fellow Gay Bears, they all are in the process of getting bum fucked by Corona. In fact, guess which state has the most DGs? Texas, which is then followed by Georgia and Florida\u2026 all of which Corona is the new state symbol.\n\nHere\u2019s some useless TA to wrap it up (I made this on March 12) - [https://www.tradingview.com/x/zbuaPPY1/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/zbuaPPY1/)\n\nTL:DR DG has a lot of room to fall\n\nMore baddie news - [https://www.city-journal.org/banning-dollar-stores](https://www.city-journal.org/banning-dollar-stores)\n\nCitations\n\n\\[1\\]\n\n[https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/53897122](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/53897122)\n\n\\[2\\]\n\n[https://www.webmd.com/drug-medication/news/20191115/fda-warns-dollar-store-about-tainted-otc-drugs](https://www.webmd.com/drug-medication/news/20191115/fda-warns-dollar-store-about-tainted-otc-drugs)", "created_utc": 1584402625.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjv3vw/dd_great_opportunity_dollar_general_dg_is_the/", "is_self": true}
