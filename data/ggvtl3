{"id": "ggvtl3", "title": "JD.com Earnings Play", "selftext": "This is my first attempt at DD, But this is one of my big gambles this week along with Cisco.\n\nTL;DR along with positions at the bottom. \n\nJD is incredibly unknown relative to Alibaba, and guarantee half this sub knew nothing about them before news of their earnings this week came out.\n\nHere are there last 3 years revenues \n\nJD annual revenue for 2019 was\u00a0$82.865B, a\u00a023.31% increase\u00a0from 2018.\n\nJD annual revenue for 2018 was\u00a0$67.198B, a\u00a020.67% increase\u00a0from 2017.\n\nJD annual revenue for 2017 was\u00a0$55.689B, a\u00a048.64% increase\u00a0from 2016\n\n\nHere is a Quote about JD not being as affected by Corona \n\n\"But unlike Alibaba, competing Chinese\u00a0e-commerce company\u00a0JD.com\u00a0(NASDAQ:JD) does not rely on outside logistics companies to deliver its packages. Instead, it owns a complete logistics company, JD Logistics. With JD Logistics of course prioritizing the deliveries of JD\u2019s orders, I think that a much higher percentage of JD\u2019s orders will be delivered within a reasonable time than those of Alibaba.\nMeanwhile, JD is using drones and robots\u00a0to deliver products to areas that have been hit hard by the new virus. I did not see any evidence suggesting that Alibaba has been able to adopt a similar strategy. Given these dynamics, I\u2019m convinced that JD\u2019s results will be much less affected by the new virus than those of Alibaba.\" - https://investorplace.com/2020/02/jd-com-is-still-a-better-pick-than-alibaba-stock/amp/\n\nJD is also almost exclusively Chinese based. And China opened up almost two months ago now, giving them a huge head start for their upcoming earnings. \n\nTheir expected eps is -.13 per share... Their stock didn't tank with covid. Their business didn't seem to suffer relative to the market. In fact, with their own logistics and drones, they stood better than they could have hoped for. \n\nFinally, announced today was their cloud based block chain as a service option. \nhttps://jdcorporateblog.com/jd-launches-cloud-based-blockchain-as-a-service-platform/\n\nI'm not entirely sure how the last part will affect them, if at all going into Friday's earnings, but further ease and integration for their services can't hurt, imo.\n\nAgain buy at your own risk, but good luck and godspeed\n\nTL;DR JD stock is undervalued and they aren't well known yet as they are still seen second fiddle to baba.\n\nPositions:\nCSCO 5/29 50C\nJD 5/15 50C (Plan to sell before earnings) \nJD 6/19 60C (Plan to hold through earnings)\n\nEdit: IV is still relatively low for them given their earnings are this week on options", "created_utc": 1589089563.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ggvtl3/jdcom_earnings_play/", "is_self": true}
