It is the best possible drug out there to get high.", "selftext": "Every retard here knows how to double down. Some know doubling down after a double down. But, none of you might have tried, triple down, then deca down. or may be triple down on a triple down and then deca-down. \n\n\nThis also gets you a great feeling of owning up almost majority of OI on an option. How much value do you put on that? You can claim yourself to be a 'Majority holder of OI of a bag of options' \n\n\nHere is how you do it, if you do not know how math works. \n\nWe should always move all in with retirement money, personal loans and credit card balances - and go triple down, and then deca-down every time your 'bagholding' thing goes down 30%. \n\nThis way - 100 calls/puts at $1.00each = $10,000 \n\n30% down - $0.70 - Triple down now\n\n100 calls/puts at 0.70 each = $7,000\n\nTotal holding = 200 for $17,000 - Average at $0.85\n\n-- You need the option to go up 21% to break even and turn it to any profit.\n\n\nIs it going down more? - Time to get a personal loan, credit card advances and money from loan sharks.\n\nNow deca-down \n\n$0.70 - 30% down from here will give you $0.49\n\nDeca down now:\n\n\n1000 calls/puts at $0.49 = $49,000\n\nTotal average 1200 calls/puts for $66,000 at an average of $0.55\n\nNow you only need the option to go up - 12% to break even and turn any profit.\n\n\n\nAlso enjoy each tick moving up and down taking your profile up and down by a couple thousand. The thrill, the hyperness, the blood pressure, the ability to give yourself a stroke - think about it? No other drug out there can do that - not meth, not glass nothing, not even a goddamn wendys burger can do that. Try and let me know if you feel that high as well. Good luck.\n\n\nTLDR - Hold 2500 or 3500 contracts of something that is Out of Money and see it move up and down. Be a part of that thrill. Life changes.
