And can you provide us with any EPS guidance for 2020?\n\nCEO of McDonald's: \"Did your wife's boyfriend come up with that excellent question? Ya, I know same store sales are down because some asshole from Questtrade ate a bat in Wuhan. Thank god I could close my stores, because I don't know how you sick fucks keep cramming your pie holes with our shit hamburgers. You people disgust me. Doug, our VP of operations and proud holder of an MBA from University of Phoenix, told us to mix in pink slime into our burgers to cut costs and you degenerates never knew the difference, thanks Doug. TBH if my dealer cut up my yayo with baking soda, I would shoot him on the spot. Guidance? I'll provide you with some guidance, mix in some exercise between eating our hamburgers. Next question.\"", "created_utc": 1586358382.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fx82e7/transcripts_from_mcdonalds_earnings_report/", "is_self": true}
