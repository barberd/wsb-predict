Now let\u2019s roll those profits into a stock that could really bump our calls to the moon. Something with a low daily volume that would sky rocket with a sudden influx of call activity. GOOGL is just the big name we here at wall streets bets to get the SEC on our tale and really throw us into the front position of determining which stocks go to the moon and which ones get thrown to the side. \n\nSo my fellow Autists what do you say? Let\u2019s move GOOGL up to 2000 and show the world the power that WallStreet Bets truely has!", "created_utc": 1582069502, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f61ale/calling_all_autists_lend_your_support_in_the/", "is_self": true}
