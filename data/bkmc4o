{"id": "bkmc4o", "title": "My picks for 5/6", "selftext": "Recap: (I was right about everything but NVDA, although NVDA did bounce hard and then dipped back down. It's trading in a channel between 181 and 814: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bi4j18/my\\_picks\\_for\\_week\\_of\\_429/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bi4j18/my_picks_for_week_of_429/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x))\n\n1. MCD. I kind of think it will try for 200 again.... but there's a good possibility that will trade sideways in a channel: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZwVmnA5b/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZwVmnA5b/) .     I was right about it mooning yesterday (Friday): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bk04nw/what\\_are\\_your\\_moves\\_tomorrow\\_may\\_03/emdb449?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bk04nw/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_may_03/emdb449?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) .   To get back into calls, see if MCD dips to 196.## on Monday and then get into 5/31 202.50calls for less than 1.00. If you followed my play, those 202.50c 5/31's went from 0.55 to 1.00, so almost doubled yesterday. Anyway, keep an eye on MCD and BTFD.... if there's even a dip from now to 200. :( \n2. IWM: in this bull market IWM was destined to break 160 (like I said last week; see link above). It closed above 160 on Friday at 160.53. Last year, on 5/17/2018, IWM finally broke 160, and then flew to 163. [https://www.tradingview.com/x/N4eMRFvD/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/N4eMRFvD/) I think there is a very high probability that IWM is going to 163 very soon, possibly by Friday. If ETSY beats on Wednesday (and ETSY is the largest holding in IWM, btw), IWM will likely go to 163 on Thursday. Once it hits 163, it will likely cool off and consolidate back to 161.## before it makes its next leg up to 164.38ish. After that the next key resistance level is 166.69: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/pbOtleNn/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/pbOtleNn/) This is based off of 2018, the only other time IWM has been in 160+ territory. I think these resistance numbers will work again, since the ALGO's bots will trade off of the 2018 data anyways. **The play: on whatever dip Monday provides, 5/25 165c for ideally slightly less than 0.60, but 0.60 would be a fine price. Could put a limit order in for 0.59 and see if it gets filled on Monday (but it may not), esp. if we open with a gap up on Monday.**                    IWM is looking SUPER bullish to me! Look at this YUGE fucking daily candle breaking out of upper BB band: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/zmCmUN3N/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/zmCmUN3N/) Solid volume. This thing is gonna fly, imo. \n3. SPY 5/17 300c for ideally 0.30. I plan on picking up 10 of these and will sell when SPY hits 296ish. \n4. NVDA: I am convinced that NVDA will find it's way back to 191 by ER, which is on 5/16. I might be wrong, of course. Last ER, NVDA wanted to get to 160 no matter what before ER and it did. NVDA is probably manipulated, which is fine with me. It is my theory that on 5/16, the IV will boost to 150%+, which has been the case for the past three ER's (I don't know what it's done before that because I wasn't trading before that). If i'm right, the 5/17calls right now are pricing in the IV at 50%. Now even if it doesn't get to 150% (which it will), there's no way it will stay at 50%; that's for sure. NVDA is at 183 right now. **The play: 5/17 200c for 1.75-1.80ish (currently pricing in 50% IV, which is just silly).** I have a theory that if two conditions are met by 5/16, this play will be profitable: (1) NVDA does reach at least 191 by 5/16 (super possible; it may go even higher, to 193), and (2) the IV does go to 150%+ like it should. If these two conditions are met, THETA will be defeated/muted. I picked one up on Friday. I plan to pick up one more on Monday. If my prediction's right, I think these 200c contracts will be around $4.00. That's a 100%. Let's see. (I think it's worth looking into these things and experimenting a bit if one plans to trade long term, imo). \n5. SQ. Looks like it established a bottom to me (maybe others who know TA better than me can comment?): 4hour: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/EJD9Kok0/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/EJD9Kok0/) Daily: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/6WDb6q91](https://www.tradingview.com/x/6WDb6q91/) .  Looks like SQ is in a following wedge, but has established a bottom with those LONG bottom candle sicks, confirmed by a Green candle with long bottom stick. This indicated, to my understanding, seller exhaustion. Here's an interesting play, inspired by this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bk8vho/made\\_it\\_out\\_of\\_msft\\_alive/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bk8vho/made_it_out_of_msft_alive/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) .   **The Play (1k profit, theta gang style):**  **Sell 67.50put and buy 67put, for credit of $16. Open 63 of these credit bull put spreads for $1008.** To keep the full $1k profit, SQ just has to close above 67.50 on Friday. I think this is quite likely, especially if this is going to be bullish week, which it's looking like to me. There is great loss protection, since the long put is so close in price to the short put. Theta should burn on this FD credit spread. SQ just has to hold 67.50 for five trading days. Open this spread on an SQ dip, for a higher credit, and then open however many (my goal is 1k credit profit). **Collateral is needed for this play: for 63 contracts, $3150 collateral is required.** That's not bad for possibility of making 1k. Of course, you can close these spreads anytime. Let's say SQ wants to test 70 this week, at least once, before getting rejected hard (i think this is quite possible), then close everything for a profit and release your collateral (i don't know how much profit this would yield).\n\n**ER PLAYS** [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bk7041/most\\_anticipated\\_earnings\\_releases\\_for\\_the\\_week/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bk7041/most_anticipated_earnings_releases_for_the_week/)\n\n1. ROKU. See what ROKU is trading at on wednesday. Then sell an insanely out the otm call (like 75) and buy a call as high as possible that will fill. In other words, there's no protection here; it's essentially the only way to play naked calls on RH. lol. Open as many as you like. The IV crush on ROKU will be apocalyptic. :) I will be doing this for free money on Wed. \n2. Sell puts on EA. \n3.
