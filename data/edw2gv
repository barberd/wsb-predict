{"id": "edw2gv", "title": "$TSLA above $420 Christmas Week", "selftext": "Alright you lovely autists. This is happening. You know it, I know it, Elon knows it. Why is it going to happen?\n\nThe shorts lost a massive 1.6 billion this last week. They will close positions Monday morning to get a nice tax break. This alone has the potential to create a 3-5% squeeze in TSLA. Thus, hitting the $420 threshhold.\n\nTesla has a holiday update coming out. There are alot of rumors surrounding this update, including either an example, or beta, of full self driving, new games, and possibly more features.\n\nLastly, there was a news article giving an update on Tesla's current position in building the Berlin factory, released this morning. Tesla is moving at a fast pace and they are ready to rock and roll in 2020 with this factory and the one in China.\n\nYes, I understand Tesla is at an ATH and their current valuation is insanely high. This will create a new group of autists to short the shit out of this company. That's just a bad idea in my opinion, but I will welcome the liquidity. It's likely Tesla will be added to the S&amp;P 500 by March.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\n\"Chicken tendies tendies tendies\"", "created_utc": 1576965915, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/edw2gv/tsla_above_420_christmas_week/", "is_self": true}
