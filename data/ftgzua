{"id": "ftgzua", "title": "Double Top Disaster", "selftext": "This idea is so autistic yet is so brilliant I'm not sure if this belongs as a shitpost or quality DD so I feel this is a fair middle ground. \n\nAfter staring at many charts, the 4 hour has taken most of time. Well after looking for so long I started to notice some extreme similarities between the last time we had our big drop and the time were living in right now. Check this bad boy out....\n\n [https://imgur.com/gallery/FzPGZQS](https://imgur.com/gallery/FzPGZQS) \n\nNow THAT is a chart that speaks for itself! Make of it what you will....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositions: $170 put 4/6s (ow) , $170 4/17s (ow),  $180 put 5/1, $175 put 6/19\n\nEdit: Positions 2.0\n\nStarted the day with 70 4/6s, 21 4/17s but sold out throughout the day\nAt the top today picked up $180 and $175\n\nDefinitely lost more than it\u2019s saying. Probably close to -$1,500 total till right now \n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/FRhovej", "created_utc": 1585807121.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ftgzua/double_top_disaster/", "is_self": true}
