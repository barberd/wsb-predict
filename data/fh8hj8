{"id": "fh8hj8", "title": "The world banks \"Pandemic bonds\". What I learned.", "selftext": "The total amount of bonds given out by the World bank in 2017 was  $320 million. In simple terms this is like your selling the world bank an insurance against a pandemic. If a pandemic breaks out you pay up. Otherwise you collect yearly interest as a premium.\n\n95$ million of these are high risk \"loose it all bonds\". The other 225 million are much lower risk and can only lose a maximum 16.7 per cent . So far they have been a great investment returning 96$ million in interest to investor.\n\nThe pandemic bonds have nothing to do with whether WHO declares a Pandemic. \n\nThe bonds instead have certain criteria that have to be meet (infections/death ratio etc). This is calculated starting 84 days after the outbreak (december 30th) and will take 2 weeks stats in too consideration. That would mean that  the data between march 24th- april 6th would decide whether it is to be considered a pandemic. They then would need some day to compile the data so the decision would be reach on **april the 9th**.\n\nThe bonds trade for around 20c on the dollar (march 9th).\n\nSome of the Bond holders (according to FT):  Baillie Gifford, Amundi and Stone Ridge Asset Management.\n\nAccording to this autist DB is fucked but the guy bases this on WHO:s declaration so who knows what other assumtion he is basing this on :\n\n [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fh0vwl/db\\_is\\_absolutely\\_fucked\\_now\\_that\\_who\\_says\\_its\\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fh0vwl/db_is_absolutely_fucked_now_that_who_says_its_a/) \n\nHow badly hurt can a bank be? Even If we would assume they bought all 320$m \"high risk\" bonds that's about DB:s yearly net income.\n\nI'm a gay bear so I recommend puts on everything bond holders or not but to me these pandemic bonds seems less interesting than they sounded.\n\nTLTR: Sorry for for not explaining it with a meme but maybe your husbands's boyfriend can help you read it.\n\nSauce:\n\n [https://www.euromoney.com/article/b1klyqsykl0d0m/when-will-coronavirus-covid19-trigger-the-world-bank39s-pandemic-bond](https://www.euromoney.com/article/b1klyqsykl0d0m/when-will-coronavirus-covid19-trigger-the-world-bank39s-pandemic-bond) \n\n [https://www.ft.com/content/a6239e12-5ec7-11ea-b0ab-339c2307bcd4](https://www.ft.com/content/a6239e12-5ec7-11ea-b0ab-339c2307bcd4)", "created_utc": 1583977099.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fh8hj8/the_world_banks_pandemic_bonds_what_i_learned/", "is_self": true}
