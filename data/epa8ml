Guaranteed 780% return in 1 year?!!!?", "selftext": "\nThe poor man's covered call is nice, but it's still a little rich for my blood. Over 1k to enter into a long LEAP? No thank you.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**But** what if we turn that LEAP into a bullish vertical call spread AND THEN sell near-expiry calls on top? (Hint: it rhymes with shmaranteed shmofit)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nConsider the following trade:\n\n- AMD spot price is $48\n\nI buy an ITM JAN21 expiry AMD Call with a strike of 42. I am charged $1339 for the privilege. Ouch.\n\n***BUT***, have no fear, I can then **SELL** a JAN21 Call with a 55 strike, earning me $755 upfront.\nThat ITM AMD call now effectively cost me only $584. *Not too bad.*\n\nBut wait, there's more: \n\n*I now begin to SELL closer expiry OTM AMD Calls*\n\nI start by selling a 50strike 31JAN earning me $177 on a position that cost me $584 to enter\nThat's right: I have just made 30%.\n\nBut it gets better: I made that 30% in two weeks. Do you know how many 2 weeks there are between now and JAN21? Probably more than 20.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter every two week period when my short OTM call expiries (as long as it expires otm) I then sell ANOTHER OTM Call, for another ~30%. 6 weeks later, I have guaranteed 100% return of my money. By JAN21, I am guaranteed 780% profit, not including the potential change in value of my initial LEAP up to the value of the short JAN21 position.\n\nAnd in case you're a pussy worried about that hanging short JAN21 position, just set a buy-to-close order at 54.5 or whatever lmao. \n\nIf you make less than 780% this year, I feel bad for you.", "created_utc": 1579129926, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/epa8ml/diagonal_call_spread_with_vertical_call_spread_on/", "is_self": true}
