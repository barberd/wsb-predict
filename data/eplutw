{"id": "eplutw", "title": "Trade Deal - Phase 2", "selftext": "Liu He slumbers. Liu He dreams of cargo ships sailing east, to the US, from horizon to horizon, exporting the goods produced his industrious countrymen. Any idea they could dream of steal was turned into physical goods, the life blood of the economy. The goods were carried away on the ships in return for money, much like red blood cells transporting CO2 in return for Oxygen. In the good times, weak and feckless leaders of the US let his country steal at leisure, no rules. China walked all over the US. That was before \"Ch\u00e9ngs\u00e8 \u00e8m\u00f3\", the \"Orange Devil\".\n\nLiu He wakes in a cold sweat, hung over from to much drink the night before. Liu He looks around in confusion, \"Where am I?\" he murmors into the darkness. The clock reads 2:45am, 1-16-20; dread slowly fills Liu He. He recalls the last 24 hours in a blur before coming to the signing with the Orange Devil. Ch\u00e9ngs\u00e8 \u00e8m\u00f3 roused the crowd with a firy, well honed speech before sitting down next to Liu at the signing table. Ch\u00e9ngs\u00e8 \u00e8m\u00f3 was a massive man, 300 lbs of pure muscle, tanned naturally in the soft Florida sun, but there was no softness here today.\n\nLiu He remembers signing, then leaving, then drinking. But what did he sign? He slowly realizes that he doesn't know what he signed, it was a redacted sheet of paper with vagueries and meaningless phrases. \"Oh god, what have I done?\", Liu mumbles to himself as he rouses to call his lover Xi and admit he has failed.", "created_utc": 1579193128, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eplutw/trade_deal_phase_2/", "is_self": true}
