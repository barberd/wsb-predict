I just got a call while in clinic that we have to decide if I want my elderly patient to go on a vent because they don't have enough vents for the new intubations going on all over the hospital today.\n\nWhat was happening in Lombardy Italy 2 weeks ago is now happening here.\n\nI am in the worst position that I never thought I would have to be in - deciding if my patient should live and in doing so maybe take away the last ventilator for a younger patient.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTldr; Buy puts, or SPXS once this bill has passed and we hit a peak. SPY gonna come crashing down hard.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: This is not a rinky dink hospital. It's a big one. Very big.\n\nEDIT 2: We are on a call right now trying to decide how to triage medications and vents. This is not about me making a profit on stocks. This is about how crazy the situation is. I haven't purchased anything today but you bet your ass I will to protect my long assets.", "created_utc": 1585155701.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fotubg/update_nyc_hospitals_are_now_at_capacity/", "is_self": true}
