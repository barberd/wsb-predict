{"id": "f23owz", "title": "Any SPY options experts....", "selftext": "Tried to play both sides of the fence. Got some puts, got some calls, started as an uneven straddle that favored a red day... I added to both sides during the day trying to improve positions and then I sold my calls for 500 profit because I was 100% sure of a gap down but of course it didn\u2019t come and kept going and left me stuck. Lesson learned, won\u2019t happen again.\n\nSo now I\u2019m at 35 puts 2/21 @ 331 with total exposure of 6k I\u2019m down about 1,500, not counting the profit from the calls (so really just 1000).\n\nI could bail and reset and still be green for the month but I definitely want to hang on for a few days and wait for a gap down from ATH before I concede to book losses.\n\nSo my question. Is there any smart play here, where I should sell some 330 puts? Collect the premium to fix this. What do you think?
