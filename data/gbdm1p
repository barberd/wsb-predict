An autistic manifesto", "selftext": "Thesis: Although we may talk crudely and we are disparaging, when you sift through the muck in this forum there are actual real nuggets of knowledge and insight. I want to relate this to the study done in 2010 about atheists and religion.\n\n[https://www.pewforum.org/2010/09/28/u-s-religious-knowledge-survey/](https://www.pewforum.org/2010/09/28/u-s-religious-knowledge-survey/).\n\nBasically it states that Atheists and Agnostics know more about religion than religious people. This made me think (dangerous, I know) that WSBers are the fucking Atheists of the investing world. it was this comment ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gay1ft/retard\\_finds\\_out\\_all\\_were\\_doing\\_is\\_just\\_gambling/fp2qk6u?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gay1ft/retard_finds_out_all_were_doing_is_just_gambling/fp2qk6u?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x))\n\nin this post\n\n([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gay1ft/retard\\_finds\\_out\\_all\\_were\\_doing\\_is\\_just\\_gambling/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gay1ft/retard_finds_out_all_were_doing_is_just_gambling/))\n\nthat set me on this path.\n\nAlthough we are assholes and idiots, we freely admit it. We all know that we don't know everything and we are mostly just gambling no matter how you look at it. We aren't (at least in my opinion) arrogant assholes and know-it-alls about our methodology. We do, however, ACTUALLY learn how the greeks, 10-Qs and 10-Ks, fundamentals work. We don't just blindly throw money at blue-chips because \"sTocKs AlwAyS gO Up.\"\n\nTherefore I propose WSB are the heathens and non-believers of the investing world... and we have way more fun!\n\nTLDR; Keep YOLOing my fellow tards.", "created_utc": 1588317565.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gbdm1p/do_wsbers_know_more_than_actual_investors_an/", "is_self": true}
