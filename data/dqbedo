{"id": "dqbedo", "title": "WallStreetBets - YOLOs Of Month (Sp00ktober Tendies Edition)", "selftext": "I track YOLOs so you don't have to - October 2019\n\nFor those of you that aren't familiar with the site I created, it's at:\n\n\\[Swaggy Stonks - WSB Analyzer\\]([https://www.swaggystocks.com](https://www.swaggystocks.com))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt contains a WSB 'Sentiment' analyzer, Due Diligence tracker, and a YOLO tracker.\n\nI've recently added a new section that will contain full, in-depth \"Due Diligence\" reports on certain companies that will include all the data someone needs to know about the company if they want to trade their stock.\n\n[Here's a link to the Due Diligence homepage](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocks/due-diligence)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Quick \"How it works\"**\n\nI log positions of posts flagged as \"YOLO/Gains/Losses\" and post them to my site. For actual options YOLO plays it will automatically keep track the current value of the play and the win/loss percent. Every position on the site links back to it's appropriate thread on WallStreetBets so you can take a look and read the comments/juicy details as well! All other gains, losses, and expired YOLOs are placed in the \"Expired YOLOs\" section.\n\nPlease note I do my best to keep track of them all and sometimes the OP of the YOLO disappears in which case I let the YOLO ride until expiry. It's fun to see what they could be worth!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Other Cool Features The Site Has:**\n\n\\-**Top YOLO**s section (sorted by upvotes, gains, and losses)\n\n\\-**Competitor Analysis Tool**: Compare fundamentals/financials for different tickers.\n\n\\-**Options Scanner Tool**: View historical estimated \"prices\" of options. A good tool to view which options are currently expensive or cheap at different ranges of OTM.\n\n\\-**Credit Spread Finder**: Search tickers and find how much premium you can receive at 'x' percentage of being OTM and how much you are risking.\n\n\\-**Dividend Screener**: Search stocks that offer a dividend and filter them by: sector, dividend amount, and dividend frequency.\n\nIf anyone has any feature recommendations, comments, or concerns post here!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# YOLOS OF THE MONTH\n\n**Honorable Mentions**\n\n \\[u/ControlTheNarrative 's realtime video of his fully-margined $50k losses on AAPL puts\\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpnzup/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpnzup/))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ACTIVE YOLOs**\n\nCRM: \\[small winner\\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/diante/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/diante/)), u/reddit1280819 (Bet Size - $109,125)\n\nAMD: \\[Team AMD; locked and loaded\\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/doc5s3/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/doc5s3/)), u/b3no_coin (Bet Size - $9,000)\n\nSPY: \\[My friend told me to do it(spy 304 ...\\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dq5oqi/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dq5oqi/)), u/orthodoxhippo (Bet Size - $5,005)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Top Gains**\n\nTSLA: \\[r/whatcouldgowrong\\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dl0ngj/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dl0ngj/)), u/tdking3523 (Gains $393,500)\n\nAAPL: \\[Shout out to the guy that told me t...\\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dgzkfz/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dgzkfz/)), u/hasbs (Gains $350,000)\n\n\\[Closed +150k/1000+%, don't want Tru...\\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dgg39n/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dgg39n/)), u/Fausterion18 (Gains $150,000)\n\nSPY: \\[$100,000 in $SPY 11OCT 294P\\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dep6ms/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dep6ms/)), u/-Hyre (Gains $145,802)\n\nTSLA: \\[Gain porn?
