It\u2019ll be after earnings, and their new drug is a one of a kind winner. It\u2019s out and being used, and these guys are flying under the radar. Outside market forces honestly shouldn\u2019t matter TOO much though obviously some more -6% market days could crush this like everything else. \n\nI\u2019m also comfortable with my STNE calls that are in July and August, but those are already way up and it\u2019s probably time to take profit. \n\nHonorable mention goes to a large cash position because the end of last week was scary AF.\n\nPositions that I hate to look at: MGM 6/19 calls. Forgot the exact strike, but I\u2019m sure they\u2019re -90% and basically dead. That ain\u2019t coming back in a week. ERI 7/17 $40c\u2019s have a chance to recover but not if this second wave media talk keeps up. \n\nBailed on bear positions on the run back up Friday afternoon. But I know you autists with SPY puts and VIX positions might be getting a chub over the weekend.
