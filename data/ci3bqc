There will be another AMD, waiting for you to buy it at $2 dollars, there will be another Trump to day trade stocks with.\n\nThere will be another. There will always be another buying opportunity. Don\u2019t feel like you got left out. Don\u2019t calculate how rich you\u2019d be in an alternate universe where you made 3 correct trades that made you a millionaire. There will be that chance again someday.\n\nHope this helped anyone that needed to hear it.
