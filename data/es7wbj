Their locations are mostly like this, mainly for pick up, instead of sit down and leech 5 hours of WiFi because you bought a cup of coffee. This is advantageous for keeping down real estate cost. It also suits the fast pace life style of the city folks (more on that later). The prices are around 36 rmb per coffee if you pay with cash, but if you use mobile app, you get about 50% off. I wasn\u2019t able to actually get coffee because I don\u2019t have a Chinese bank account for WeChat pay. \n\nOh the point of WeChat pay, literally everything is done through it now in China, from restaurants, to umbrella rental, to street vendors. This makes cash users like me look like peasants from the Stone Age. It makes every transaction very fast, which goes back to what I said about fast pace life styles in Chinese cities. Another thought is that the Chinese government likely have access to WeChat pay\u2019s data. If everything is paid with WeChat, the government literally has complete view of economic activities. Privacy stance aside, this will allow the government to micro manage the economy in real time - look at demand, pricing, etc. Overall this is probably good for the Chinese economy, regardless of what our thoughts on privacy.\n\nIn terms of coffee consumption, China is way behind, but that only means all the room in the world to grow. Young people obviously embraces western culture more, and coffee will start to play a key role in academic life. Schools in China are brutal. I\u2019m talking about making US schools look like a vacation brutal. More and more coffee will be consumed for test prep and study in general. For young professionals working in tech, they also have 60 to 80 hours a week of work, and you bet coffee will come into play. This bolds well for both StarBucks and Luckin. It\u2019s up to them to execute. Since Chinese government is known to favor home grown competition to the US companies, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they tip the scale favorably towards Luckin. \n\nAll these info aren\u2019t meant for weekly or monthly play. Coffee has huge potential for growth in China, a country traditionally drank tea. Long both Luckin and Starbucks probably, on a 1-5 years time frame.", "created_utc": 1579673397, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/es7wbj/luckin/", "is_self": true}
