So I invested all my money, so about 10000 dollars into $RAD with an x5 leverage at the end of last year, right before results, as I was smelling new Irish CEO would speak some good words and so I turned it into 87000$ at some point when it went from 7.50$ to almost 25$ PPS in just a few days. \n\n![img](mu5mebonh9i41 \"The graph shows only about 50000 dollars at top because this is realised equity only and doesnt show profit on open positions.\")\n\nI enjoyed the tendies with travelling to some 1000 bucks a night hotels in my Adidas trousers, made gifts to the whole family, donated a bit... Then $RAD crashed back to 11.60 while I still had open positions on it. Didn't want to believe it would go that far. I lost tons of money on the way down, even realised losses to the point where I was back to just 12000$ of equity. I was losing up to 15k a day, realised loss. I was feeling like shit but decided I won't give up. More over I still have my tax to pay.\n\n![img](nr9fj603j9i41 \"One day of hard loss on $RAD end of January.\")\n\nSo guys I couldn't just walk away I had no choice and I put my whole salary back into it after that and it started going back up again. Right now I'm back to it with more than 90% of my equity into one single position, with an x5 leverage again. I will go through next earning with this bag and see what happens but my plan is to repeat History and pay my Tax.\n\n![img](w30a8hifj9i41 \"Current positions on $RAD with leverage 5\")\n\nI will keep you updated.", "created_utc": 1582284976, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f79uut/poor_to_rich_to_poor_in_one_month_with_rad_whats/", "is_self": true}
