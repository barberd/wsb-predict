This season, AMD switched to one of their biggest open wheel rivals - AMG. It must have taken a stupid amount of money to get Lisa to switch from Ferrari to Mercades in one season, which shows just how in demand these technologies are. **\"****AMD previously partnered with Mercedes F1 rival team Ferrari,  however, form the beginning of the 2020 season AMD branding will be  exclusive to the Mercedes-AMG Petronas team.

Rest assured, eSports is  going to cement itself as a staple of the 21st century. AMD sees this, and embraces it. They've been partnered with FNatic for three years now and picked up Evil geniuses last year. As this industry grows, so will Brand exposure for AMD.  Don't believe me? The International Olympic committee is debating on putting eSports in the olympics THIS YEAR, and Formula 1 already has an eSports division.\n\n[https://www.espn.com/esports/story/\\_/id/15232682/esports-olympics-2020-happen](https://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/15232682/esports-olympics-2020-happen) \n\n[https://f1esports.com/news/2020-explained/](https://f1esports.com/news/2020-explained/) \n\n[https://www.amd.com/en/gaming/esports](https://www.amd.com/en/gaming/esports) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MARKET EXPANSION**\n\n***Mobile Phone Market*** *- As of last June,* AMD is partnered with Samsung's mobile division - making use of the RDNA chip and effectively setting the standard for the mobile GPU market. While they're in development right now, Samsung's first line of products using RDNA is supposed to hit shelves in 2021. That means that this year, Samsung is going to be actually buying AMD's materials and using them. **\"****To answer your second question about our AMD partnership. As you  know, AMD has been a leader, especially in the GPU area since the early  days of the PC market and is one of the leaders in terms of technology.  We think that with this partnership, we will be able to leverage the GPU  competitiveness of AMD to enhance the performance of not only our  mobile SOCs, but also in other applications.\"**\n\n[https://wccftech.com/samsung-amd-rdna-gpu-2021/](https://wccftech.com/samsung-amd-rdna-gpu-2021/) \n\n***Desktop PC Market*** \\- Last earnings, AMD saw a large market share (16.2 -&gt; 18.3) increase in the Desktop PC market.

This has been reflected by market growth in this industry. While they're only at 4% market share, AMD is landing HUGE clients. In 2020, AMD has Epyc orders from Dell, IBM and Nokia. Last year, AMD got HPE, Lenovo, VMWare, Google, Twitter, AND Microsoft. Not only that, Intel is supposedly responding by dumping funds into RnD in order to update the Lake architecture. Now, if Epyc really was going to lose out to Intel in the long run why would Intel be responding in such a manner?\n\n[https://www.extremetech.com/computing/305811-rumor-intel-prepping-xeon-cascade-lake-refresh-to-fight-amd-epyc](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/305811-rumor-intel-prepping-xeon-cascade-lake-refresh-to-fight-amd-epyc)\n\n[https://www.networkworld.com/article/3431380/amd-hosts-an-epyc-party-and-everyone-wants-in.html](https://www.networkworld.com/article/3431380/amd-hosts-an-epyc-party-and-everyone-wants-in.html)\n\n[https://wccftech.com/amd-epyc-cpu-server-market-share-10-percent-2020/](https://wccftech.com/amd-epyc-cpu-server-market-share-10-percent-2020/) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**INDUSTRY EXPANSION**\n\n***Semiconductor Industry*** \\- In a technologically focused society, the companies that foster and develop technology will inevitably prosper.
