May Satchel Nutella, and Father Branson bless us with many tendies. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut, a few upcoming events make me thing it may be time to buy some VIX calls for the end of March.\n\n1. Chinese customs did not release shipping data for January, instead they said they combine with February data.  Those numbers are probably going to be bad.  Lunar New Year + WuTang Virus. (May already be priced in)\n2. Super Tuesday is on the 3rd of March, a historically volatile day for markets. \n3. WuTang Virus seems to be getting worse. China seems to be finally allowing a WHO / CDC team to travel to china to investigate this coming week. Think the WHO / CDC's numbers will look like the Chinese statistics? \n4. The current VIX price is low. Not historically low, but low. \n\nThoughts?", "created_utc": 1581799240, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f4fcmj/vix_calls_tendies/", "is_self": true}
