I\u2019ve been browsing for cloud, IT, software stonks with decent volume that haven\u2019t popped like Twilio and Data Dogg. \n\nI saw WORK, which I sold my calls at open for small profit (FUCK). I saw NEWR, then a jabroni did DD on them, they opened at -3% before smashing earnings AH today but trusty Robinhood had me restricted ALL FUCKING DAY on a -$12 margin call or whatever so I missed that boat (FUCK).\n\nNow we got YEXT. Please share insight. Do you use their services? Are the Greeks for 6/19 favorable? Do you have positions? expander2? Please for the love of Christ don\u2019t delete this mods.\n\nCash Gang, -65% gang, and CGC $15c 6/19 and $20c 6/19 (their earnings are 6/18).\n\nEdit: Fuck it I\u2019ll post a position tomorrow with DD.
