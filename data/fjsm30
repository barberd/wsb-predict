{"id": "fjsm30", "title": "Short selling UPRO and TMF DD", "selftext": "So besides investing with insane leverage I made a critical mistake in blindly YOLOing Hedgefundies - volatility drag.\n\nAccording to the UPRO and TMF prospectuses these funds suffer from severe volatility drag when volatility (the VIX) jumps to high levels:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/tgXC6e9\n\nSo this portfolio is going to be massively red even if the stock market has a 60%+ annual return while VIX remains above 25-50. \n\nThe reason behind this is simple, say we have several days of +9% gains, -8% gains, +9% gains:      \n           \n(1-.08)\\*(1+.09)\\*(1-.08)\\*(1+.09) = 1.00560784x the starting portfolio value.  \n\nPretty break even for unleveraged long/short stock. \n\nHowever, when you have 3x **daily** returns these ETFs provide:       \n        \n(1-.08\\*3)\\*(1+.09\\*3)\\*(1-.08\\*3)\\*(1+.09\\*3) = 0.93161104x the starting portfolio value.\n\nUPRO is ETB at TOS. So if you can endure a few +- 30% days, *on a small portion of your portfolio*, you could come out with some good volatility drag gains shorting UPRO.\n\n# TL;DR\nSell short UPRO alone or the Hedgefundies portfolio (UPRO/TMF) and wait, collecting some sweet volatility drag.", "created_utc": 1584393486.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjsm30/short_selling_upro_and_tmf_dd/", "is_self": true}
