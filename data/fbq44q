I have been viciously and ruthlessly been watching the market, and based on my expertise the market has been on downward trend. I think I know the reason as to why. Not many people have heard this, but there is a new threat on the horizon. It is called the bud light syndrome. It has not been fully priced in with the corona virus. This is the true threat in question. Now is the time to worry. Boomers are calling bull, retards have yet to see the global effects.  The only foreseeable hope is space travel (Earth is Fucked), DADDY BRANSON you my only hope.\n\nWith this information, I give you the plays for FREE TENDIES:\n\nSPY 250p 4/20\n\nSPCE 100c 4/20\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLove,\n\nskaterdude975", "created_utc": 1583043818, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbq44q/free_tendies/", "is_self": true}
