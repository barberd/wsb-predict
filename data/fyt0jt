Even if we had to keep things locked down until the end of the year, most companies would come back strong with the help they're getting from the government. Sure it may take a while for some to get back on their feet but is the situation really so worrisome that you think people would give up their equities? Obviously this is the time to buy and hold with the virus dying down, even if we have to stay in quarantine for longer.\n\nPeople are not burning through savings. Poorer people with jobs that need to be furloughed (or if laid off) are on unemployment getting the equivalent of like $19-$20 an hour. People with more money are just wfh and have plenty of savings to whether a couple months, or more. Everyone will have plenty of money to spend when things open back up. Anecdotal - I know plenty of people that are dreading going back to work because they're \"making\" much more sitting on their ass at home.\n\nLast but not least - do you think Donny is going to let the markets crash and people's savings get wiped out in an election year? Personally I think he does actually care about people and doesnt want to see them hurt in this way, but the election year thing seals the deal. He will keep the markets up no matter what hence unlimited brrr. And the MMs will do what he says bc he's the fucking president and will more than likely win again and be in the position the create favorable laws for them. They won't pull the rug.\n\nLast thing, very telling: remember the night before the rally started? Futures limited down in about 2 min after opening. It was looking like another circuit breaker day. Then Donny and JPow announce unlimited QE and full support for the market. We flipped around overnight and had a massive green day. Since then, we've not seen ONE major red day, just two or 3 smaller ones in the past 2 weeks. This tells you a lot, I think.\n\nBears?", "created_utc": 1586566023.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fyt0jt/bears_please_submit_your_counterargument/", "is_self": true}
