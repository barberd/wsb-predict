{"id": "d367ba", "title": "Why this Uber/Lyft labor bill stuff is just plain stupid", "selftext": "Is it just me or are the drivers picking a fight they going to lose no matter what? If the bill gets approved, Lyft or Uber could easily just stop drivers from getting rides if they detect the drivers are nearing 40 hours of drive time and thus keep them as contractors. I fail to see the why these drivers are pushing for employee status when in the end it is going to result in a shittier deal for a larger amount of them and a marginally improved deal for a small amount of them, with less freedom. Do these people not realize they\u2019re about to make themselves full time taxi drivers?\n\nThe DD here is that Im doubtful this bill is going to go into effect when Lyft/Uber have some very smart people that should be illustrating this to the legislators. \n\nBTFD.", "created_utc": 1568285987, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d367ba/why_this_uberlyft_labor_bill_stuff_is_just_plain/", "is_self": true}
