Although I have been very successful in the past predicting movements traders should always make an effort to adjust their positions based on changing political and media landscapes. This approach isn\u2019t meant to be any more accurate than a meteorologist predicting the weather. Take positions at your own risk and always do your own due diligence. I release these for thoughtful criticism from traders who use different approaches for analysis.\n\nTl;dr: Momentum indicators on longer intervals have almost completely neutralized while leading indicators show weak signals for a potential bearish move. Once again nothing here makes sense other than theta plays. CCS 303/305 5/27. IF YOU\u2019RE LOOKING FOR A PLAY I AM HIGHLY CONFIDENT IN, THIS ONE IS NOT IT.\n\nTicker: $SPY\n\nIntervals: 1W, 1D, 1H\n\nIndicators: MACD, KDJ, MA(200 & 50), NetVolume, DPI, Short Interest\n\nSignals: \n\n1W: MACD Neutral, Net Volume (440M) Bullish, KDJ Overbought Slight Bearish Convergence\n\n1D: MACD Neutral/Bullish, Net Volume (64M) Bullish, KDJ Overbought Slight Bearish Convergence \n\n1H: MACD Convergent Inconclusive, Net Volume (-65k) Bearish, KDJ Overbought Convergent Bearish\n\nKey Supports: \n\n293\n\n290\n\n283\n\nKey Resistances:\n\n297\n\n313\n\n320\n\nPosition: Short 303c 5/27 Long 305c 5/27\n\nTargets: Take profit at 50%+ gain due to theta decay or market movement.

DPI and Short interest indicate declining long positions in the market suggesting a possible move down in the near future. Although the market has already moved passed a significant area of resistance and could potentially accumulate a move up to 313 fib levels. Shorter intervals suggest bearish movement early week. The only play that makes sense here once again is one in which time is on your side.\n\nCharts: https://imgur.com/gallery/yAnhfWf\n\nAlternative Plays: JETS, HAL\n\nYouTube Walkthrough on TA: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k\\_OwPvHtn70", "created_utc": 1590375878.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gq379x/spy_techinical_analysis_525_neutralbearish/", "is_self": true}
