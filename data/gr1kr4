After the lovely memorial weekend where everyone forgot about RONA clapping Booty cheeks, retail is on the rise and people are buying shit. Guess what stores are opening up in droves... APPLE bitches. Other than inbreds thinking an Apple a Day will keep the Kung Flu away, does anyone know what the most common purchase for students (who all are just graduating and getting graduation gifts) going to college is. Laptops. Layer that with the potential that these kids are thinking all their classes are gonna be online and you got the perfect storm of people buying macs like hot cakes. Pair the retail bump with the massive cash stores that Apple has and their equally massive purchase of nextVR meaning they are slapping R and D through the tits and hitting new technology sectors (long term play) and your green dildos from this trade will be side by side double team JPOW butt to throat fucking Winnie the Chu all the way back to Apple ATH and beyond. $325 end of week and $333+ by 6/12 go get your tendies.", "created_utc": 1590514512.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gr1kr4/alright_autists_aapl_ath_imminent/", "is_self": true}
