{"id": "f3aqp9", "title": "Let make some money together!", "selftext": "Back in the good ol days (like two months ago) this sub was all about loss porn. A few unvaccinated individuals would make money by betting against whatever was done here, but the rest of us who were vaccinated as children just lost money, but we had fun doing it.\n\nNow, the normies have come in with real money and fomo and listen to this sub, buy whatever we tell them, and now everyone is making money (expect those of you who bought high on TSLA and MSFT, but keep reading, everyone can make money with my plan).  That's great but lets be better! I say, like the Russians manipulating our election, let's ~~manipulate the market~~ really work together to make money. Here's what I propose. \n\n1) We all by a super cheap stock. Let's say $ACB\n2) We start posting \"ACB to the moon\" and talk about how great the \"technicals\" are (let's be real no one actually understands technicals but if you say it confidentiality enough and throw in enough terms and numbers, you look smart so people will believe you).  And, if we are using ACB, we can really play up the fact that it's weed and in Canada (libtard normies love weed and Canada).\n3) buy some way OTM calls and post those positions (\"ACB to $7 by Friday!\" \"I'm all in on $ACB to $10 by 3/6!\" - note, don't actually be all in, but buy a call or two and Photoshop your screenshot to look like you bet your entire Robinhood account on i that way it'll be cheap and generate interest).\n4) after we've done this for a while, everyone is talking about ACB and how it's undervalued.  They start buying (normies fomo) so the price goes up drastically\n5) get to a point where even we realize how bloated the price is, mass sell to the normies (who still think the stock is going to the moon). Profit\n\nOh, and we own the majority of the stock so at shareholder meeting we just elect ourselves to the board so now some of us have jobs too.\n\nI don't see how this can fail, so who's in?", "created_utc": 1581604082, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3aqp9/let_make_some_money_together/", "is_self": true}
