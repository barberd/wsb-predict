Sure, CTM bought some, but he also bought some ATM. (What could go wrong, IV crush was priced in). But this guy could have made himself a 100,000% gain!\n\nI think what he did was brilliant. He found an exploit *and* used it \ud83d\udc4f I\u2019ve noticed a lot of comments, though, that he should have levered to infinity plus 1.\n\nHere is my opinion: maybe he did sufficiently leverage to his PRT.\n\n$50k is not an insurmountable amount of debt. Sure, it was an autist gamble, but he might even dodge the debt because that is a seriously retarded flaw that RH overlooked. He can fight back from that if he\u2019s on the hook, and it is also small enough that RH counts it as a learning lesson.\n\nIf he went full retard and levered up to $500 M , he would have caught the attention RH, the media, and all the AMD Jan 2022 call sellers. That can\u2019t end well.\n\nSure, why bet against AAPL, and why not sell some dumb credit spread for crumbs, but he had a chance to net hundreds of thousands with decent odds. \n\nThat is fucking stupid risk, but at least it was asymmetric.", "created_utc": 1572829125, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dr9ww3/prt/", "is_self": true}
