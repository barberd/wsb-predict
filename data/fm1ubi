That's a substantial amount of my yearly income because I'm a plebeian. I started with $100. \n\nThough the stock market can be unpredictable, and I'm down $150 this week on Ford, Six Flags, and AMC, here's what I've learned:\n\n1) Don't buy calls mid-pandemic that you're not selling that day. Most people who have made tons of money on calls in the past few weeks have bought them prior to one of Trump's speeches and sold them the same day.\n\n2) Don't buy calls when skilled fiction writers concoct a story about EOD green. When there are hundreds of people dying in Italy every day, worldwide border restrictions, corporations on pause, why the hell would you buy calls EOD?\n\n3) Don't panic sell your puts.\n\n4) Don't buy anything with no volume or a massive bid-ask difference.\n\n5) Before you buy something, just go to the news tab of Google and read the headlines for 15 seconds.\n\nAlso, the people who are actually good at this took their logo to the private sub. We're not getting that shit back.", "created_utc": 1584735136.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fm1ubi/when_you_shouldnt_trust_wsb_for_advice/", "is_self": true}
