It\u2019s a pattern it has played out often and a throwback to when it was less competitive and kind of a dog.  \n\nThe difference here is that according to fundamentals, it shouldn\u2019t drop - at least not that much.  The future outlook is positive and surprisingly, even more so in the longer run.  So I think it\u2019s a good growth stock still and it should reach analyst estimates of $60 well before the next earnings call.  \n\nIt\u2019s always important to glance over at what Intel is doing when considering AMD.  Right now INTC is still mired in production issues. It\u2019s trying to pivot into cloud data center biz to offset their chip biz losing market share - and to their credit, are doing a good job of it.  But as far as AMD is concerned, that\u2019s fine and shows INTC is not doubling down to try to fix their long term issues in this market.\n\n I\u2019m staying long on AMD and once the flu and the irrational earnings call sell off reaction passes I think we\u2019ll bounce back to the low 50s and start climbing to the $60s.", "created_utc": 1580322466, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/evqu01/called_the_amd_drop_after_earnings_heres_whats/", "is_self": true}
