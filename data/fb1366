Take what you want from this information, but from what I can tell viruses or diseases spreading lead to a high in GLD (which most of you probably already know), and I believe we have already reached that high. Let alone with the fed likely soon to step into lower interest rates, that will also likely decrease the price further.\n\n**tldr; short gold or $GLD**", "created_utc": 1582921892, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fb1366/dd_on_gld_tldr_included/", "is_self": true}
