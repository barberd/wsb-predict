How much is a blue box worth?", "selftext": "LVMH the French luxury conglomerate announced in late 2019 they intend to buy TIF for all cash $135 a share.  \n\nhttps://www.lvmh.com/news-documents/press-releases/lvmh-reaches-agreement-with-tiffany-co/\n\nAt 16.2 Billion, this is the single largest luxury goods merger in history.  \n\nAt the time of the announcement stonks were trading at \nLVMH - $89\nTIF - $90\n\nToday\n\nLVMH - $73\nTIF - $128\n\nIn Feb TIF shareholders approve the merger \n\nhttps://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/tiffany-stockholders-approve-merger-with-lvmh\n\nThis is all well and good but what are the chances LVMH goes through with it? Their CEO is addicted to mergers but he\u2019s also addicted to getting good deals.  \n\nEven if TIF is still worth $135 a share, if LVMH backs out of the merger TIF would plummet to the 70\u2019s or 80\u2019s.  Maybe even 60\u2019s in the wake of the Beer Flu.\n\nLVMH\u2018s Italian suppliers are balls deep in beer flu and can\u2019t work from home.  \n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/how-italy-is-trying-to-make-luxury-goods-under-lockdown-11583918609\n\nBut In reality how many people are buying Champaign and Billion dollar dresses in the wake of the been flu?\n\nWhat I couldn\u2019t find was anything that shows what LVMH\u2019s breakup fee.  IF Arnault backs out aka there is a chance TIF is sent back to the wild to fend for itself.  If that happens, stonk is gonna drop like a regular non-diamond rock.\n\n$TIF 8/21 P 100\u2019s", "created_utc": 1584363591.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjkkc4/lvmh_buys_tif_or_do_they_how_much_is_a_blue_box/", "is_self": true}
