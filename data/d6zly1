Biggest names with largest market caps sold off at or below Dec \u201818 lows. Some have exhibited stronger support at higher levels but eventually sold off and continue in their downward fall. \n\nHEXO up 10% on no news and last trading day before 9/23 earnings. Only news are \u201cbuy\u201d articles with no substance. Calls are dirt cheap, puts are expensive. \n\nIs this the buy-up before it shits itself?", "created_utc": 1569006606, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d6zly1/hexo_up_10_before_923_premarket_earnings/", "is_self": true}
