{"id": "fit5yg", "title": "The Shadow War: How Thursday and Friday Set Up for Another Engineered Circuitbreaker Next Monday 3/16/20", "selftext": "**Are our markets under a coordinated financial attack?** We thought MM were tinkering with things behind the scene, but there is an actor with tons of capital squeezing our MM in the USA, draining liquidity as MM face increased losses and are unable to provide transactions for people trying to hedge in these financial markets, and bringing about these engineered drops in the stock market. The timing of this is not coincidental given that we are currently engaging the coronavirus amidst the backdrop of an election year and instability with the oil pricing war. I've created this thread with /u/bemusedfyz after hashing out these thoughts.\n\n**Part I. Firms/Hedge Funds are Net Short Gamma Resulting in MM Buying Calls to Provide Liquidity**\n\nIn a bull market, firms purchase calls to be long gamma. MM try to capture rebates by taking on the opposite positions since they do not physically own the security.\n\n**\"This means that whenever a market-maker fills an investor's buy order, the MM is facilitating the trade by shorting shares. \\[1\\]\"**\n\nThey have to go short in order to sell a security they do not own (this is why they are exempted from short selling). In the other case, during a downturn, firms want to hedge using puts and become short gamma, thus MM must take on calls. As people previously noted in my posts, if there is a buyer of an option, there has to be a MM selling the option to provide the liquidity. How then do MM make profit? They make profit from rebates by providing tighter spreads compared to other MM. By narrowing the bid/ask spread, MM keep the rebate, creating very thin margins. Thus, volume and liquidity are key to profits for MM.\n\n**Part II. How Options Inform Price Action by Identifying the Real Money Flows**\n\nPeople have been asking \"how do you know which options for SPX/SPY being purchased are purchased by actual firms for a position?\" I've been using 3 key metrics to inform me of the direction of intraday trading, and I will explain them more in another thread:\n\n1. Strike/Expiration\n2. Block Size\n3. Correlation with volatility, gold, and treasuries\n\nOptions data within the last 10 minutes of close has been particularly informative of the direction of the following price action. During the close on Tuesday, volume was strong on the buy side as we bounced from the June 2019 low, and we broke back into the 285 channel which was previously strong support indicating a bullish signal (Figure 1).\n\n[Figure 1: 3\\/10\\/20 and 3\\/11\\/20 SPY Chart](https://preview.redd.it/npzk20opjqm41.png?width=2130&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab92a2d280fab8b65b0538984f12604c18186308)\n\nIf someone was purchasing large amounts of puts (this was not just Tuesday, but last Friday and Monday as well), then MM were hugely positioned unfavorably with calls on the opposite end of the trade. Immediately after trading, we had a huge fade immediately after close. **There has been strange price action where TLT fades, which indicates more liquidity being brought into the indices along with the short cover rally**. **However, right after the close, we immediately fade hard and futures dump.** MM therefore need to hedge by trading futures, or by delta hedging and selling shares at the open with a significant loss, magnifying selling dips. This is similar to how autists discovered during a rally, MM delta hedge by purchasing the underlying equity contributing to the rally.\n\nDelta hedging refers to either having an opposing option with equal magnitude of delta, for instance a straddle, or by purchasing shares of the underlying stock. One key disadvantage with delta hedging is that MM can over hedge if the spot price of the equity changes unexpectedly overnight. This is referred to as **gap risk**, and compounds with **the inventory MM hold** overnight, often referred to as **inventory risk**.\\[2-3\\] The overnight moves create huge gamma and vega swings to the inventory of MM who hold overnight, which subsequently create a period of selling or buying which magnifies the intraday swings as they try to reduce their vega or gamma exposure.\n\n>... is subject to residual risks due to stochastic volatility and unhedgeable overnight moves in the stock price. These risks highlight the need to keep the Vega and Gamma of the dealer\u2019s inventory under control, and this is reflected in the dealer\u2019s quoting strategy.\\[4\\]\n\nGiven that we dumped on Wednesday and dropped below 285 support, institutions need to hedge with more puts given the uncertainty about retesting the June 2019 low. More puts purchased by funds, more calls purchased by MM. What happened Thursday and Friday (Figure 2)?\n\n[Figure 2: 3\\/12\\/20 and 3\\/13\\/20 SPY Chart](https://preview.redd.it/wrgfx8w0kqm41.png?width=2130&format=png&auto=webp&s=780e573d407e05b4b7cd721ded33273c0fbcb0da)\n\nFutures limit down on 3/12/20. No matter what, the market opens -5%. Within 5 minutes at the open, the market hits the second circuit breaker at -7%. MM are stuck with short term calls, and need to offload losses by selling like crazy to delta hedge magnifying losses. Then what happens on Friday 3/13/20? Limit up. We next quickly hit one of the largest intraday rallies of all time.\n\n**Part III. MM Cannot Access Repo Despite Requiring Liquidity**\n\nDuring trading on Thursday, the Fed announced an unprecedented amount of Repo operations. 1.15 trillion dollars, signifying significant issues in the market. I stated this before open on Friday.\n\n>8 am - Yesterday, the fed offered more than 500 billion in repo. Only 78.4 billion was taken. Today, the Fed just offered more than 1.1 trillion in repo for today. What are the signals? Why is Wall Street not taking the money for liquidity? Check this out: [https://www.biancoresearch.com/the-moment-in-this-decline-has-arrived-2/](https://www.biancoresearch.com/the-moment-in-this-decline-has-arrived-2/)  \n>  \n>This could possibly be way worse than 2008.  \n>  \n>8:30 - 24.1 billion in repo taken. Last update will be 9am.  \n>  \n>9:00 - 45.1 billion.  \n>  \n>Net repo: 86.5 billion out of 1.15 trillion\n\n**\"Dealers are telling me they badly want the $1T in repos, but can't take it.  Post-crisis rules, among so many different regulators (Basel 3, Fed, OCC, FDIC, etc) make it nearly impossible for them to take the money.  They are telling the Fed their problems.  The Fed had no clue.\"**\n\n[https://twitter.com/biancoresearch/status/1238461580314120193](https://twitter.com/biancoresearch/status/1238461580314120193)\n\nDuring Thursday's trading, we broke the support. Due to breaking previous supports and being oversold, I had puts. But also noticed huge call volume. If someone is buying calls, MM need to be net \"short.\" Futures limit up. MM need to quickly buy the rally in order to delta hedge, creating an epic rally for the past decade.\n\n**Part IV. The End Game**\n\nSomeone is taking advantage of the MM delta hedging by limiting down or up futures, vastly opposite of the price action more often than not without regard to support or resistance levels. MM are left bagholding their positions and delta hedging, magnifying the rallies or dips.\n\nRepos are not being adequately uptaken due to existing regulations. What happens when liquidity issues arise despite decreasing volatility? MM need to enlarge the spread in order to further manage losses.\n\nIV was going down on Friday during the rally, as VIX began dropping. The only way for the option value to decrease is if MM started enlarging the spread, in order to capture diminishing rebates. The only way the bid value is increasing is if a MM is facing liquidity issues, since they cut into the rebate. What happens when these firms become stressed and unable to provide liquidity? Firms will be unable to purchase options with good bids or at all. If people are not able to hedge or use financial derivatives, losses will accumulate such that there will be a mass liquidation event such that it is no longer tenable to hold any positions.\n\nWhat happened immediately after close Friday?\n\nThroughout the day there was massive amounts of put buying. Immediately close to the cash close, more puts were purchased. At the cash close, we fade hard. Immediately after, /ES gaps down more than 2% after the close on Friday. /CL gaps down more than 3%.\n\nThe news during the weekend last week for the oil price was dropped during Sunday before markets opened, causing a limit down last week. **Energy is the market**. Saudi Arabia is a strategic partner with the US in the Middle East, and asking Russia to aid in production cuts to raise the price of oil. However, Russia refused. Saudi Arabia is not taking these measures to attack US energy markets by increasing production. Despite this, is Russia interested harming US interests? Perhaps. It's possible to think there is another player. And they know that US markets cannot access repo money and are short in liquidity, creating a unique attack vector, straight at the heart of the US financial system.\n\n[https://news.bloomberglaw.com/securities-law/mnuchin-says-hes-seeking-to-keep-financial-markets-open](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/securities-law/mnuchin-says-hes-seeking-to-keep-financial-markets-open)\n\n**\u201cWe intend to keep the markets open -- that\u2019s a sign of confidence for people,\u201d Mnuchin said in a CNBC interview early Friday.**\n\nIt is not only MM that require repo money. Banks lend out their credit lines to others. It is these businesses that are lent the money that will be the hardest. Given these market conditions, and if they persist, the government needs to intervene and shut down markets.\n\nWe are already facing close to limit down on the Weekend Dow on Saturday. Sunday Futures are likely to limit down. This will probably be compounded by either worse impending virus news or more bad news in the energy markets. To combat this, Trump has stated the US intends to significantly add to the US strategic oil reserve to put a floor on the price of oil. However, these are being used as a cover to justify lower prices, when in fact, the markets are being engaged possibly by economic subterfuge to reduce liquidity. Someone is purchasing huge options positions before close with MM take the other side of the trade. Futures limit up/down, creating large gap/inventory risk, reducing liquidity for the markets.\n\n**tl;dr Banks and MM are facing forced liquidity issues by someone taking advantage of limit up/down, exploiting gap and inventory risk. Banks and MM cannot take on repo due to regulations to correct liquidity issues. Funds and trading desks need MM to purchase puts/calls. Cannot purchase them due to MM having liquidity issues with worsening bid price, magnifying rallies or drops as MM delta hedge. If firms cannot stop losses without hedges, they will liquidate everything. This will create a mass panic sell off, which will therefore require the government to shut down the market.**\n\n**tl;dr of the tl;dr Circuit breaker Monday. Possibly two.**\n\nUpdate 1: /u/Sushies, /u/satorikang both explained the positioning is probably long gamma on the puts, not short at this stage. Thanks.\n\n\\[1\\] - [https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/download/pdf/short\\_is\\_long.pdf?](https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/download/pdf/short_is_long.pdf?)\n\n\\[2\\] - [https://www.forbes.com/sites/petertchir/2015/09/03/mind-the-liquidity-gap/#2259300073fc](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petertchir/2015/09/03/mind-the-liquidity-gap/#2259300073fc)\n\n\\[3\\] - [https://www.sec.gov/divisions/riskfin/seminar/venkataraman0313.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/riskfin/seminar/venkataraman0313.pdf)\n\n\\[4\\] - [https://people.orie.cornell.edu/sfs33/StoikovSaglam.pdf](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/sfs33/StoikovSaglam.pdf)", "created_utc": 1584234389.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fit5yg/the_shadow_war_how_thursday_and_friday_set_up_for/", "is_self": true}
