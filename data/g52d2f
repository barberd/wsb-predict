{"id": "g52d2f", "title": "How retards can make money off the oil drop today", "selftext": "TL;DR - You would have to be retard to think that the oil futures ticker on Yahoo Finance is not going to look like the value increased by 10000000000000% tomorrow. $XOM 5/1 41c -> $XOM 6/19 40p\n\nAs I'm sure you are well aware of, oil futures dropped into the negative today. THE KEY WORD FOR YOU RETARDS OUT THERE IS ---OIL FUTURES---. While the futures are indicative of the market as a whole, I bet most of you fuckers do not know what a futures contract is, even thought it's an FD.\n\nFor the gambling addicts out there that think that FD = deep OTM lottery tickets, there is another kind of financial derivative out there called a 'futures contract'. Some futures contracts are based on commodities, like gold, wheat, pork, oil etc.. Lets just keep it to oil here so the neanderthal rock market traders among us can follow along. When you buy an oil futures contract, you are entering into an agreement to buy 1000 barrels of oil (it's a fixed amount, think the 100x deliverable for stock options). Here's the catch: You are agreeing to buy 1000 barrels of oil at a price that is set today, but you will get the oil barrels at some date in the future. So for the retards, they named it a futures contract.\n\nSo what the fuck happened today? Well these contracts are created by some big ass fuck off oil company that has oil flowing out of its asshole. These contracts are used to hedge, these companies have 10 million barrels of oil they have to sell, but they don't know what the price is going to be tomorrow, so they get some sucker to agree to buy it at today's price. That sucker hopes that those barrels of oil will be worth more tomorrow and they can turn around and sell the contract to the next sucker. This is called speculation, and this is what you fucks do all day. Well speculation on oil gets fucked if oil demand is completely murdered and OPEC countries are having a contest to see who can piss out the most oil. And the futures contracts that are being tracked on the top ticker of Yahoo Finance expire today. So today a ton of retards realized that tomorrow an oil tanker is going to pull up to their moms house and drop off 1000 barrels, and fuck me mom is going to be pissed off when she sees that, and there will be no more tendies or Xbox for a month. So they decided to sell these contracts at fire sale prices, and this eventually resulted in people paying other people to take the contract so they did not have to store 1000 barrels of oil at their house. While these futures contracts are indicative of the general sentiment surrounding oil, OIL STILL HAS VALUE, IT IS NOT SO WORTHLESS THAT THE BIG COMPANIES WILL PAY THE AVERAGE CITIZEN TO TAKE IT. THIS PRICE ANOMALY IS MOSTLY CREATED BY RETARD SPECULATORS (in my opinion, keep in mind, I'm retarded too).\n\nNow how can you make money off of this? First, I'm going to let you in on a little secret, I'm a little bit retarded, but here's what I think is going to happen. The futures contracts for oil are not going to be negative tomorrow. Tomorrow, the Yahoo Finance ticker is going to track the oil futures for next month, and those are worth about $20 right now. When the normies see this huge increase in oil, but don't understand what is actually going on behind the scenes, they are going to FOMO into oil stocks. Don't get me wrong, oil is still fucked in the long term, but I think that tomorrow we will see a jump in oil stock prices at open. \n\nLet me spell out nearly exactly what I'm going to do for the slow learners. \\*\\*\\*DEPENDING ON THE PRE-MARKET CONDITIONS\\*\\*\\* I am going to buy $XOM short term (maybe weeklies, maybe a bit longer than that) calls at open, hopefully for a cheap price. XOM will see a rise in the morning, and when I make the tendies that I want to make, I'll transition these into long terms puts. \n\nGood luck out there fuckers.\n\n||||\n|:-|:-|:-|\n||||", "created_utc": 1587420145.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g52d2f/how_retards_can_make_money_off_the_oil_drop_today/", "is_self": true}
