{"id": "fnui1i", "title": "I compiled DD from the last 3 days for you cucks, plays included", "selftext": "Alright dick wads, this is gonna be a long one and I know only like half of you can read so I'll put the important stuff at the top and a tdlr at the bottom, your welcome.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst off, the wuflu is fucking us. Not just us as in the US but us as in the world. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnm2yr/gentlemen_its_been_a_pleasure_serving_with_you/) explains why we are fucked. It sucks but its true. The virus is spreading in the US faster than it did in Italy (due to our much larger population) and Italy\u2019s cases and deaths continue to rise by the day with no signs of slowing. If this is a sign for how its gonna go in the rest of the world (which it is) then buckle in cause we are going down. The overwhelming consensus is that no one has ever seen anything like this before and we have no idea what will happen, only that the bottom is not here yet. Now you have two choices to make.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Roll over like a coward and just let Winnie The Poo and his Covid19 dick mushroom stamp us all, or;\n2. Suck Winnie's dick like a man, buy puts in the countries that are in the process of pulling their panties down for wuflu and profit off of circumstances that we have no control over. I know which one I'm choosing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis leads to some DD (That I have only compiled, not wrote) which explains some decent options we have here. First, buy puts in Mexico (EWW), Germany (EWG), France (EWQ), India (INDA), and Australia (EWA). Now I didn't get info on all these countries but there are other posts here you can use or just type it into Google. I did, however, get posts describing how fucked [India](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fn93kr/india_getting_worse_rapidly_inda_20p_424_inda_19p/) and [Mexico](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmk7lh/mexico_dd_short_eww/) are.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow that we have daddy corona out of the way, we can focus on individual companies. First off, the mother of all cuck traps... Disney (DIS). Get it through your heads that the mouse can not be beaten. They have such a diversified business model that just because the parks close doesn't mean they are fucked. Mickey has a bigger cock than all of us and will gladly swing it around. It is nigh impossible to profit off the rat. But be wary, if a profit is gained you get out and you stay away from it for the rest of your life because that massive, dirty rat will bite your dick off the next time you try anything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext, Starbucks (SBUX). One of our own resident autists has embarked on an [Autist Investigation\u2122](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmzsq6/dd_i_did_a_the_big_shortstyle_research_on_sbux/) with the goal of Big Shorting one of the many heads of BECKY. Read the post for more info, but it seems that overpriced coffee is not necessarily a necessity in the midst of a pandemic. Believe what you must but at this point, it seems that puts are a good idea right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow to Harley Davidson (HOG). I honestly don't even want to waste my finger strength typing this out as I have to use them on myself later so read this about how [Harley is fuk](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmh129/harley_davidson_hog_is_going_to_0/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Next a PSA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fms8nt/oil_and_gas_indexes_being_liquidated/).  OILU and OILD are being delisted by the end of March so I hope you fucks don't have them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere was a post about how corporate bonds are gonna default and I have no idea what that means but it seems that we can make some money off of it so check out [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmr3dp/corporate_bond_defaults_are_coming/) regarding that.  Corporate bond defaults are gonna fuck some companies in the ass so buy puts on these corporate bond ETF\u2019s; HYG, LQD, JNK.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, I have a little knowledge for you and will try and include this in every DD summary I do so here it is. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fn5f4p/hedging_for_autists/) explains hedge (for all you retards like me hedge=reduce risk) to save yourself from yourself. Skim what you can because you aren't gonna read all of it but at least say you tried.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy plan is to post one of these on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday so tune in next time for your tri-weekly DD summary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Coronavirus is daddy so buy puts in EWW, EWG, EWQ, INDA, and EWA. DIS is too big to fail so get out of there when you can. SBUX might be a good play so puts. HOG is fucked so profit from their death; puts.", "created_utc": 1585006409.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnui1i/i_compiled_dd_from_the_last_3_days_for_you_cucks/", "is_self": true}
