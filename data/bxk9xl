{"id": "bxk9xl", "title": "BYND Earnings AMC and Borrow Rate", "selftext": "I have zero clue how they'll do. I hope well, but I have no insight. Some things which may positively impact earnings: Impossible Burger (their main competitor) had a product recall according to Pat LaFrieda, so that might help. Some people reported seeing vendors sell out of Beyond Meat, but none of the ones near me were sold out... Some things which may impact negatively: Some people reported that BYND had trouble meeting demand as their supplies were low. Again: I have NO CLUE if that is true, but it those are some of the factors that may impact the results. If supplies truly ran out, it may cause expenses to shoot up as they have to pay rush delivery to meet demand. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Estimates**\n\nRevenue: Avg estimate is $39m with a range of $38-40m based on 8 analysts (seeking alpha is my source). Does anyone have a better source? I'd love to see it, if they do!\n\nEPS: $(0.15) with a spread of ($0.18)-($0.12)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot sure if they'll provide revenue guidance but avg of 2Q19 estimates is $48.3m and avg of FY2019 estimates is $204.9m, up 133% y/y. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Updated Borrow Rate from Today:** I have seen borrow rates of 111%, but new borrow rates that S3 is quoting is 97% on existing shorts and 130-160% for new shorts. 51% of the float is short. According to S3: \"There is virtually no lendable stock left to borrow, any downward price moves in the future will be due to long selling.\"\n\nSo arguably this quarter's earnings and guidance (if they provide guidance) are going to be more important than normal as this will likely be the only negative catalyst, if they miss, for the next 3 months. Because no smart money manager will want to pay an annualized borrow cost of up to 160% for a 3 month period to sit on their hands...", "created_utc": 1559846348, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bxk9xl/bynd_earnings_amc_and_borrow_rate/", "is_self": true}
