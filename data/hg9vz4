{"id": "hg9vz4", "title": "Google's 'Sabrina' threatens ROKU's dominance", "selftext": "ROKU shareholders and prospective shareholders should read about Google's streaming device release ['Sabrina' potentially coming out later this year](https://www.xda-developers.com/google-android-tv-dongle-specs-gaming-mode-stadia-support/). Here's a video demo of the product as well: [Sabrina video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=gLCoaEDBre0&feature=emb_logo). All of this was obtained from a firmware pre-release. It's legit, but not disseminated across the market/officially announced yet. \n\nROKU's strength comes from dominance in two important areas:\n\n* Their device marketshare [(a plurality at \\~39%)](https://www.multichannel.com/news/roku-and-fire-tv-control-70-percent-of-smp-market), secured both by actual Roku devices as well as software licenses to smart TV manufacturers like TCL, Insignia, Sharp, Hisense, Hitachi, LG.\n* Their ownership of DataXu, which aside from the The Trade Desk (TTD), has the best Connected TV buying platform. They were the first to marry access to all major suppliers with a cross device graph and performance reporting. Most buying platforms or \u2018Demand Side Platforms (DSPs)\u2019 have access to the same inventory, but prior to their acquisition, DataXu did a terrific job of overlaying the right tools and technology to attract buyers. This made them an excellent acquisition target for Roku. Of course this is all a little subjective, but I\u2019m lucky enough to work in this business, so I\u2019m sharing some aggregated insights from ad buyers. Also worth mentioning: [Roku captures 59% of all programmatic ad marketshare.](https://blog.pixalate.com/ott-ctv-programmatic-ad-device-market-share-roku-2019#:~:text=Here%20are%20the%20top%20five,Chromecast%20(4%25))\n\nThe reason I\u2019m highlighting all of this, is that ROKU has done what so many have failed to do\u2026combine device marketshare with a focused, well-loved CTV buying platform. Why have FAANG struggled to do this?\n\n* Amazon is a content producer (Prime Video) as well as a device/software manufacturer (Fire TV). They sell advertising (Amazon DSP), but so much of it is focused on shopping and direct response. It\u2019s not a focused platform, and the ad buyers I know have shied away from Amazon DSP as an aggregated CTV buying solution for now. \n* Netflix is a content producer and a CTV app. They are also known for not having advertising. To me, they are the least likely to compete with Roku on the device side, and have way too much conflict to launch a full fledged ad business that would enable ad buyers to purchase space on other apps. It doesn\u2019t even make sense. It may not be worth a bullet on this list\u2026but I wanted to address where they sit for those that are ROKU buyers but may not be as familiar with how the industry breaks down. \n* Apple has Apple TV, but seems pretty disinterested in creating a minority report-level ad business. In fact, they\u2019ve been the most aggressive about shutting down third party cookies. Ads in the app store are the extent of their ad business today. Maybe one day they\u2019ll do direct sponsorships on Apple Music, but they are technological AND philosophical lightyears away from touching user ID-driven advertising.\n\n\u2026.Google launching a plug and play device, however, is very interesting. They\u2019ve had Android TV as a native OS, but Sabrina represents a direct attack on Roku\u2019s independent device business. Google is also known for breaking down its ad platform into manageable parts for ad buyers. They have one platform specific to search called Search Ads 360.. and one for display & video called DV360. They also have the most widely trusted data analytics platform for marketers: Google Analytics. \n\nIf Sabrina becomes wildly popular, Roku could face a serious threat. If the rumors about Google wanting to acquire Roku are true, that would be good news for us\u2026and may represent Google\u2019s desire to do an instant takeover of the CTV device space. This is why I'm waiting to open any new positions for now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Still bullish on ROKU in the longterm as they have an unbelievable head start, but Google\u2019s Sabrina device represents a potential threat, and more importantly a ***perceived*** threat to Roku\u2019s dominant device + ad business marketshare. Owners of the stock should track news of this release.\n\nPositions:   \nOwn 200 ROKU shares @ $110.   \nWaiting for additional acquisition news, but will likely buy ROKU 1/15 $110P within the next 60-90 days", "created_utc": 1593185983.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hg9vz4/googles_sabrina_threatens_rokus_dominance/", "is_self": true}
