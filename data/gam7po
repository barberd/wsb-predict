TED talk inside.", "selftext": "TLDR: Tick tock, we\u2019re living in a simulation that will come to an end sooner or later.\n\nOpinion: **We should all come to the conclusion that Trump sees the stock market\u2019s success as the true picture of our economy.** \n\nThat being said, as far as I know the election isn\u2019t until November (7 months from now). \n\nIf the market tanked in a matter of weeks, why wouldn\u2019t the FED be able to again just pick up all the pieces once more should it happen all over again. You can\u2019t all be seriously thinking we\u2019ll hit ATH in the next week or two and sustain that till November and beyond. \n\nLet\u2019s be real, Trumps buddies got smacked, he gave them a helping hand and now they\u2019re in a prime position to short the market and make their money all over again. Trump can be the hero once more. \n\nYes the recovery won\u2019t be V shaped, so it\u2019ll be booming after a \u201chealthy drop.\u201d Every figure, every analyst, every projection is looking for some kind of pullback. \n\nEven bullish investors I follow are starting to get confused. Yes this isn\u2019t 2008, but even back in January everyone and their mother was screaming that stocks were overvalued. \n\nNow with a global pandemic, unemployment at record highs, stimulus for everyone, GDP contraction at great depression levels, and we\u2019re all of a sudden back?? It\u2019s just not healthy, PERIOD. It\u2019s not sustainable. Q2 numbers are expected to be shit. Everyone\u2019s guidance is basically pulled. And look at the markets reaction last week when news broke out that Gileads drug could be a flop.. it spooked! \n\nThings are running on very thin rope here and I personally see the risk/reward for long positions at this moment pretty low. That\u2019s not to say we won\u2019t run up another 5, 10, 20% who knows.. we\u2019re currently living a simulation.. but if the hammer should fall, it\u2019ll likely fall hard.. maybe it\u2019ll be similar to the 2010 flash crash. Who knows. \n\nIn the end, bulls will have their days, and so will the bears. You can all throw insults at each other when the tables turn towards you then. \n\nThanks for coming to my TED talk.
