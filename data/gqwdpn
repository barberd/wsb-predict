It seems like any type of major event that could cause enough fear for a real crash isn\u2019t possible. I feel like it would take Trump passing out and dying from Corona and then shitting his pants on live TV to even cause a circuit breaker to be a possibility. It makes sense that we won\u2019t probably see such a dramatic drop as we have the last few months but what kind of news can you predict that would start sending the market spiraling down?", "created_utc": 1590497230.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gqwdpn/can_the_market_still_crash/", "is_self": true}
