Their annual earning statement shows them consistently failing to turn a profit. Their sales continue to decrease. Further more, they're out of season, with their primary customers (students buying textbooks) no longer buying textbooks this year. Also, textbook companies are choosing to go digital by either shipping through amazon or just selling digital copies\nOn the technical side of things, both the MACD and the TSI appear to be topping out and starting a trend downward for the 1 month. So it's likely that a reversal is on the way. So buying puts for 4.5 expiring next week doesnt seem out of the question.\nAgain, this is my first DD, so please let me know what you guys think.
