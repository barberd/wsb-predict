{"id": "fa8hkn", "title": "Why now is the right time to buy tech.", "selftext": "  I\u2019m amazed how irrational the market situation is, why is everyone selling off their tech stocks? \n\nWith the coronavirus and H9N1 around, every fucking body\u2019s gonna be at home either tinkering with their tech or masturbating. This obviously leads to increase in demands for computers, phones and all that tech shit especially when shit starts breaking down and everyone wants to invest in a good entertainment device to wait out the viruses at home.\n\nWhen everyone stops leaving their homes because of the virus fear and starts locking themselves in, the revenues of tech companies are going to skyrocket. When\u2019s the last time you ACTUALLY had sex? Never, nada. BUT when\u2019s the last time you took a hard wank on your computer or phone? I\u2019d say at least 3 times yesterday. \n\nDo you see pattern my fellow autists? Now is the PERFECT opportunity to buy tech calls, normies are being straight up pussies by selling off but when shit hits the ground we\u2019ll see AAPL, MSFT, ROKU, NFLX and all literally go tits up.\n\nFuck off with that \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b shit, the tech bulls boutta take over. That\u2019s all for my TED Talk.", "created_utc": 1582788348, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fa8hkn/why_now_is_the_right_time_to_buy_tech/", "is_self": true}
