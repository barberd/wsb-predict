{"id": "esnn1l", "title": "SPCE is a dilution machine (DD)", "selftext": "Here's some real DD for you all. SPCE has more than doubled in the past month and everyone is hype for it. Do you know why it's up? Speculation alone. Their operating income is $0 as they have never recorded a sale and their only profits from Q4 2018 to Q3 2019 came from issuance of common stock, more commonly known as dilution. Now, the latest filings we have from SPCE are from November 12th, 2019 where their market cap was under $900 million and their stock price was just over $10. Now as we know their stock closed at almost $20 today, January 22nd, but their market cap has skyrocketed to over $3.8 billion. How has this happened? Dilution which means that the company is just pumping shares into the market. Per the November 12th filings SPCE had under 83 million shares outstanding, which includes insider shares and the float shares. Today though that amount is 196 million, which means they have more than doubled their total amount of shares on the market. Keep in mind that the only reliable guess of their cash balance is $0-$100 million, which is not nearly enough to really roll operations forward. If you're long for tendies be careful for the secondary offering to come out of nowhere and screw you hard. Best of luck betters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone wants to validate this go ahead and do so its all in their filings and accounting.
