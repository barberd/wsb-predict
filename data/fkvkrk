{"id": "fkvkrk", "title": "YOLO Play - Flipping Enbridge pipelines (ENB) stock tomorrow for 10% gain", "selftext": "Listen up. The Canadian energy sector has been absolutely rocked in the last 2 weeks due to a >50% drop in oil price. The Canadian oil benchmark, WCS is now trading under $10/bbl, meaning that it now costs unhedged producers more money to take the oil out of the ground than to sell it (lel). Without a doubt, many Canadian high cost of production oil companies will completely evaporate. But fuck them anyways.\n\nCanada's biggest pipeline company is Enbridge, and their share price has dropped from $57CAD to $34.5CAD during this time. Enbridge doesn't build pipelines without first having long term contracts in place to ensure they get their money back. Oil price drop hurts their customers, but they are still going to get paid regardless. Oh but what about the risk of their customers going under? Fortunately, at least in the short term, their largest customers didn't go full autism and hedged a good portion of their crude, so they'll be ok for a while.\n\nOver the last week ENB has been red, green, red, green, and red. Today was a bad day for Canada's oil sector due to a 1 day 20% drop in oil price. ENB was down over 10%. Oil has already bounced off it's lows for the day and I expect some short term gains for ENB. \n\nPosition: 200 ENB.TO shares @ 33.80 CAD\n\nPlanning on selling tomorrow on the bounce.\n\ntldr: flip Canadian's darling pipeline company tomorrow for quick gains", "created_utc": 1584560003.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkvkrk/yolo_play_flipping_enbridge_pipelines_enb_stock/", "is_self": true}
