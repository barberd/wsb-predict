I'm going to ramble a bit, but also try my best to clarify some details on the most important points that make this virus likely a big deal.\n\n**What is the mortality rate?**\nFirst things first - anyone giving you a specific number with any certainty at this point doesn't know what the fuck they are talking about, and you should ignore their opinions. You can do some rough and dirty calculations to make very rough estimates, but that's about it at this point. Simply dividing total cases / deaths is nonsense as this virus infects new people more quickly than it kills its old hosts.\n\nJust to give you an idea of why this is almost certainly a bigger deal than the seasonal flu, I'm going to do a quick and dirty estimate of the morality rate one here based on the recent lancet paper estimating 37,000 - 130,000 infections as of January 25th. \n\n**Assumption 1:** We're going to assume 75k infections on January 25th. Not all of these are going to be brand new infections, but as infections spread exponentially without intervention, most should be pretty new. We'll pull 50k from our ass as brand new infections to keep this simple.\n\n**Assumption 2:** Next, I need to point out that the average incubation period is about 6 days. It can be up to 14 days, so this assumption will mean our number is a bit of an underestimate. Next, you should also realize that it has been reported in the recent lancet papers that the first week of illness is quite mild. It is only around week 2 *after first showing symptoms* that pneumonia and acute respiratory distress develop, which is what kills patients. (Likewise, this is why you should not look at the mortality rate of non-China infections just yet. Most of them haven't been showing symptoms for very long, so many have not been infected long enough yet to be expected to develop pneumonia). Thus, we are going to assume that the earliest point at which the average infected patient dies will be around 13 days after being infected. Realistically, it will probably take at least a couple more days longer for death to occur. We'll say 14 days just to make this simple. This is likely an underestimate of days until death.\n\n**Calculation:** To calculate the mortality rate, we need to simply do cases/deaths. However, as explained above, the case count should represent the # of cases as of January 25th - we said 50k based on the lancet study. The death count, as per assumption 2, should represent the number of deaths roughly 2 weeks later - February 8th.\n\nOh shit, we can't do that yet.\n\nWell, let's just do it anyway: ~(250/50k)*100 = **~0.5% mortality rate** \n\nIf we assume the high end from the lancet study, ~(250/130k)*100 = **~0.2% mortality rate**\n\nFor comparison, seasonal influenza has a mortality rate of approximately **0.1-0.2%**.\n\nSo what's the problem here? Well for one, this number is very likely an underestimate. I erred on the side of caution with this quick and dirty estimation. We used data that is a full 7 days ahead of the anticipated lag period for death caused by new infections. As a result, we used the # of deaths caused by what must have been a much lesser # of infections, and attributed it to 50k and 130k infections. Even then, we ended up with a mortality rate greater than influenza (if not by much). \n\nIn reality, if you want to see a more accurate estimate of the mortality rate using this mediocre model, you should be waiting to recalculate this until around February 8th. Obviously, that's a lot of potential additional deaths to drive that mortality rate up further. We still do not know what the actual mortality rate is, but with this quick, dirty and reasonably conservative calculation, we've shown that there is a pretty good chance it is at least as bad as the flu.\n\nThus, the potential for economic disruption here in China is pretty significant. At a minimum, it appears to be cause mortality at a rate comparable to a bad flu strain. Potentially, we could be seeing a mortality rate as high as 1-3%. The WHO director general also stated a 20% severe complication rate; personally I don't know that I believe that is correct - my guess is that he might only be considering the known cases for that number. But for comparison, the influenza severe complication rate is about 1%. Thus, even assuming that we are underestimating infection cases by 10x, we still end up with something more significant than influenza. Even if the mortality rate is on the low side, if the hospitalization rate is that high, we have a significant problem on our hands.\n\nGiven the apparent high contagiousness of the novel coronavirus, I think it's clear that there is potential for this to be very disruptive. While it is almost certain the mortality rate is not as high as 10%, it is also likely that it will be more disruptive than seasonal influenza. \n\n**Disclaimer:** I own puts against Spy purchased on Monday. I also made several assumptions, which are debatable. The lancet study could be underestimating the # of actual infection cases. If so, then the mortality rate is lower than estimated here. Conversely, if they overestimated, then the mortality rate is higher than estimated here.", "created_utc": 1580595720, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/exdo0n/coronavirus_dd_why_you_are_probably/", "is_self": true}
