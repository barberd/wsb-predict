Today I'm presenting two to support my hypothesis, Bollinger bands and Fibonacci retracement (in the discord we call this the double inverse fettucini retracement witcher indicator). I'm not going to explain these indicators at length because someone on google that isn't blitzed right now will do you better.\n\n[SPY](https://preview.redd.it/qqughjnai3t41.png?width=3234&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cae0804d4111a31f1ddbbe7468c3e1b1712fbdc)\n\n1. Today we noticed a key reversal of price bouncing off the resistance of the upper bb. 2) Price closed below the 277 fibonacci support today, and futures are trading at about 275 at the time of posting. Next support is 264.\n\n[MACD](https://preview.redd.it/ovo0ucyhj3t41.png?width=1534&format=png&auto=webp&s=39815cfaabde83020a414f1bf17a4b846e1d0cbd)\n\n3) Hey, look. we are overbought, bigly.\n\n**Economics and other points**\n\nI don't think I have to go into deep detail on our economic situation, as it's posted everywhere on here and cnbc, bloomberg etc, and I'm not gonna argue about how rallys usually quickly follow steep declines like we experienced in march. What I will say is, in the upcoming couple days, [more and more shitty, leveraged banks and boomer institutions will be releasing their shitty earnings](https://markets.businessinsider.com/earnings-calendar). Keep in mind, a lot of these companies are banks: how has that sector faired this week post-earnings?\n\nThe cherry on top: unemployment numbers that will continue to be astronomical. The market hasn't cared the past month when these numbers come out BeCauSe IT;'s PrICED IN- but given that both retail and banking took huge shits this week, along with technicals that will make ur shitty python algo ejaculate, I think we're looking at perfect storm here.\n\nWhat happens after friday is outside the scope of my autism. Also, please note that this is not financial advice, as I've lost 20k in puts this months, and i need them to print- the most important factor of this entire DD)\n\n**Tickers:** Depending on how the market opens, and what trump tweets, I will be throwing most my portfolio into 50C TZA 4/24, 18C SPXU 4/17, 139p VTI 5/15\n\n**Pussy plays:** 145p VTI 5/15, $273p SPY 4/24\n\nas you can tell by my potential possessions, im actually quite gay even after the jpow green dild incident. good luck bears\n\nOh and as always, checkout SPG. I've posted about them before and have been making mad money riding their waves. retail got rekt, and I have a feeling a lot of their big renters (JCP, M, etc) won't be paying rent later this year.", "created_utc": 1587008125.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g27b1k/the_perfect_storm_just_took_my_autism_meds_cant/", "is_self": true}
