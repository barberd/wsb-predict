{"id": "fn471b", "title": "[DD] INDIA IS TOAST", "selftext": "So far India has 396 confirmed cases of its 1.33 billion population (0.0000297 percent). Sanitation and hygiene practices are horrendous at best. The number of tested people is extremely low (14,000) because of limited testing supplies and capabilities. People are defying the curfew ordered by PM Nodi to get to their home villages (and because of the lack of testing, it could be spread even more). Also a major Hindu festival is about to start, and the government has only recently canceled plans for people to congregate at the sacred city of Ayodhya. However, people since this is such an important festival, people are still going to try to go (and may even bribe their way in).\n\nBecause of all of this, India is going to have a massive surge in confirmed cases and deaths soon, and all INDA puts will print.\n\nSources: \n\n[https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/coronavirus-cases-in-india-live-news-latest-updates-march22/liveblog/74754630.cms](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/coronavirus-cases-in-india-live-news-latest-updates-march22/liveblog/74754630.cms)\n\n[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-51922204](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-51922204)\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/03/22/world/asia/ap-as-virus-outbreak-india.html](https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/03/22/world/asia/ap-as-virus-outbreak-india.html)\n\n[https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/authorities-ban-entry-pilgrims-ayodhya-ram-navami-mela-coronavirus-scare-1658279-2020-03-21](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/authorities-ban-entry-pilgrims-ayodhya-ram-navami-mela-coronavirus-scare-1658279-2020-03-21)\n\nTL;DR INDA $20p 4/17", "created_utc": 1584900921.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fn471b/dd_india_is_toast/", "is_self": true}
