The bloody U.S. Jewish History Museum has 30 mil debt and went for bankrupt recently.\n\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/tump-debt-make-coronavirus-worse-global-economy-stock-markets-2020-2](https://www.businessinsider.com/tump-debt-make-coronavirus-worse-global-economy-stock-markets-2020-2)\n\nThe global debt-to-GDP ratio hit 322% in the third quarter of 2019. In developed markets debt hit 383% of GDP. This includes everything from household debt to corporate and sovereign debt.\n\nEveryone is piling up so much debt everywhere in the bloody world, today we are facing a real beer virus crisis and now everyone is stopping to buy and make shit, it would make companies unable to pay their debts while households unable to pay their bills.\n\nBut, everyone can't have more debts as there isn't economic activity, we are having so much debts that most can't even pay back the interest!\n\nSo the Feds have to lower the rates or else everyone would go to default due to negative cycle as no economic activity=no income=can't pay back debts interest=Bankruptcies=negative cycle\n\nRight Now, Italy is in so much debt now that it could only pay for a 4 billion stimulus which translates to 4 billion/1.95 trillion GDP in 2019 = 1/487.5, which means that the stimulus is smaller than 1 day of the 2019 GDP in italy. The stimulus would most likely be used within a bloody week and worse is not even arrived due to the incoming supply chain collapse in Late-March - April.\n\nIdk, but we would see what happens in March and April\n\nThis is a pic about US corporate debt to GDP ratio: [https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-02/usa-corporate-debt-to-gdp/12015230](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-02/usa-corporate-debt-to-gdp/12015230)", "created_utc": 1583211318.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcpi96/i_finally_know_why_the_autistic_feds_are_cutting/", "is_self": true}
