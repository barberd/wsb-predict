Everytime i made an offshore RMB (USD/Yuan) call, chinaman fucked my account back twice as hard. Chinaman made so far 3 big holes on my account. I've learned to always put and never call.\n\nBack with the chinaman after 3 big holes because fuck me (pun intended). Made 5 RMB puts so far and chinaman won't rise up anymore and its getting less inflated by the day. So far only losses on my RMB positions, i think that RMB is finally going down, but i am affraid to close them or even open puts on the offshore RMB.\n\nIs it a CHINAMAN trap to open a 4th hole making me close my puts and opening calls?\n\nChinaman isn't the same anymore? \n\nIs Offshore RMB finally deflating?\n\nim scared. should i seek help?\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the RMB?", "created_utc": 1572536912, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dppf1m/what_happened_with_the_chinaman/", "is_self": true}
