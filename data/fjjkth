{"id": "fjjkth", "title": "Expectations tuesday in europe?", "selftext": "So I can confirm being retarded since I bought AEX 4/17 puts for like 0.35 each and the closing was 0.05, I lost money on that one since I bought in too early in the day but still held on. Luckily I didn't buy with much money, but NOW I fucking woke up with the puts being rocketed up 1500% (now just Imagine if I had bought in at closing when it dropped down to 0.05) and with the puts I held I only profited about 50% compared to the >1000% I could've profited. What do you european fellows think tomorrow will happen? Will the 0% rates and Fed injections across the globe affect the indexes? The Netherlands has Air-france KLM cancelling about 90% of the flights. Will we see another bloody day tomorrow?", "created_utc": 1584358707.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjjkth/expectations_tuesday_in_europe/", "is_self": true}
