This game has had honestly the most hype since MW2 and GTA V. \n\n\nThe video game industry is dying for a real game. They tried sci-fi with shooting people in space and walking on walls. People didn\u2019t like that. \n\n\nThey decided to #tbt to the good ol\u2019 days and ya that was fun for a while until people got bored of it. \n\n\nA key example of this is the ArmA series. The ArmA series was mainly contemporary until the release of ArmA 3, which took a mild albeit radical shift to 2035. \n\n\nNow now I know tf does that have to do with this? ArmA 3 has a very robust modding community. You know how many of these futuristic mods they have that *aren\u2019t* inspired by other games? NONE. \n\n\nWe weebs need another contemporary style shooter. And with the performance of the Beta weekends, which also had the most participants of ANY CoD Beta... ATVI is gonna be delivering tendies I tell you. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nNow, how to play this? \n\n\nSince I lost too much money because of you fucks I\u2019m playing stonks this time. I\u2019m gonna hold through until earnings. Its gonna hit 60$ by the next EOW if they pump out numbers for CoD sales. \n\n\nFortnite might be king but CoD has a place in all of your hearts. \n\nOr try inversing me... maybe this will pull a $TSLA or a $SPLK", "created_utc": 1571933205, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dmijzw/atvi_dd/", "is_self": true}
