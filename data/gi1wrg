I know a lot of you will hold that long term, good for you but the rest of us are hungry for short term gains and I have the next winner right here in my pocket. BioCrystal Pharma, working on a drug similar to GILD but safer. It\u2019s being tested in Brazil as we speak and could here more positive news in the news few days. Rumors going around that they will also be receiving funds like $NVAX did which caused an insane fucken pump. BCRX is currently undervalued like a sumabitch and if you look at the daily chart it has a giant gap to fill and it\u2019s in the fucken middle of it as we speak. BCRX can see $7 this week... lots of momentum coming into pharma as the race to a vaccine continues. \n\nTL;DR tomorrow at open I will be buying 5 contracts of JUNE 19 $8 calls. \n\nRide with me into the land of Tendies once more.", "created_utc": 1589249456.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gi1wrg/bcrx_the_next_nvax/", "is_self": true}
