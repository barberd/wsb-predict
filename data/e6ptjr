In short I am planning on navigating the impending volatility spike and figured I would put this memo out to any one who wants to learn something.\n\n**What is Gamma?**  \n[Gamma](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gamma.asp) is defined as the rate of change in an options price relative to changes in the underlying.\n\n**What is Gamma Exposure in Current Markets?**  \nGamma exposure is essentially the overall gamma levels in the current market. Market Makers generally attempt to remain Delta neutral and so they will hedge out delta via the purchase or selling of shares in reference to their selling of options contracts. If you want to see what I mean by this, I explain it a bit more in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e5xn7f/daily_discussion_thread_december_04_2019/f9nver0/?context=3) comment.  \n\n\n**What is Gamma Exposures Effect on Current Market Participants and Strategies?**  \nOverextended Gamma exposure creates extremely volatile swings and changes in price at certain definable levels in the market. It is the reason why Trump tweets that have the same exact implications, can have very different effects on Volatility depending on the current price of SPY or SPX when he tweets them. For example: A market moving tweet at SPY levels of 313 would not have nearly the same effect as a tweet at the 315 or 311. At these two levels Gamma either flips, or falls off dramatically meaning that market makers would be forced to do some serious movement of shares in order to remain delta neutral. Check [this chart](http://stocks.tradingvolatility.net/gexCharts) out to see more.  \n\n\n**Why is Gamma Exposure Important now, but Wasn't Earlier?**  \nGamma Exposure is always present, What has changed for it is that the two points I talk about in the comment linked above are moving closer and closer together each day. Not only is the price of SPY and SPX moving closer to at least one of these points, but the points themselves are moving closer and closer together. This means that the time before the price is forced over one of these Gamma flipping points is nearer and nearer. VIX will spike as price moves over these points. Particularly the lower one. Additionally Gama exposure is at an ATH thus priming the market for an explosion of volatility. Total Gamma exposure for SPX currently stands at over 424,000,000 for outstanding options at the 315 strike.  \n\n\nI am currently working on a project that will determine the \"distance\" between these two points and calculate the average rate at which these points are moving closer or further from each-other over a given period of time, as well as determining with more certain accuracy what effects the rate of movement of these points.  \n\n\nFor more information I would recommend reading these:  \n[https://squeezemetrics.com/download/white\\_paper.pdf](https://squeezemetrics.com/download/white_paper.pdf)  \n\n\n[https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=048098119110098012077003030111096095019007064059048087112093110094126075081123094086120062044006006096062116096126093017091006007089081088015069113108025109084007066049091100113123101009092123116100087007120011103029009105122115127112067098082090&amp;EXT=pdf](https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=048098119110098012077003030111096095019007064059048087112093110094126075081123094086120062044006006096062116096126093017091006007089081088015069113108025109084007066049091100113123101009092123116100087007120011103029009105122115127112067098082090&amp;EXT=pdf)  \n\n\nIf you don't think ZeroHedge is complete hot garbage (it is btw) you can also check this article and conversation out:  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/e5lr1t/nomura\\_warns\\_of\\_imminent\\_gammaflip\\_risk\\_in\\_stocks/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/e5lr1t/nomura_warns_of_imminent_gammaflip_risk_in_stocks/)  \n\n\n[https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/nomura-warns-imminent-gamma-flip-risk-stocks](https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/nomura-warns-imminent-gamma-flip-risk-stocks)  \nA very Important thing to keep in mind with all of this is that there are many ways to calculate Gamma exposure and determine what the overall implications are. The variances in your financial modeling will greatly impact the proficiency of your results. Overall, ongoing research and data has lead me to believe that current financial markets are caught between a rock and a hard place so to speak and that longing VIX would be a reasonable strategy to profit. From this I am enacting a VIXY:NYSE and VIXM:NYSE trading plan in which I will begin averaging into shares rather aggressively expecting a pop within the next 7 to 10 trading periods. Generally I do not trade volatility but the implications suggest that the risk/reward ratio warrants attempting a new strategy.\n\nI will answer any questions for anyone looking to understand this more.\n\nTL;DR: Buy VIXY &amp; VIXM", "created_utc": 1575589047, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e6ptjr/understanding_gamma_exposure_in_the_market_an/", "is_self": true}
