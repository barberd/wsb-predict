{"id": "f7cwyc", "title": "$LK Luckin Coffee Sale", "selftext": "\u2615\ufe0f is becoming more popular in China due to Western influences. Starbucks is having trouble entering the market in China due to the price they are retailing the coffee for. Luckin sells drinks about 20% cheaper due to the amount of space they rent in a building. Luckin is also bringing drinks to vending machines in order to almost eliminate their rent costs to sell at a cheaper price. Luckin is also tech driven which will help predict the amount of materials and orders they need to be efficient. I have seen many people (on YouTube) that compare the quality of the coffee similar to Starbucks. Luckin was trading at around $50 right before the Corona Virus hit. Luckin has huge potential as China people are starting to get more into coffee. Currently Luckin is on sale around $40.
