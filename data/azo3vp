{"id": "azo3vp", "title": "I'm a pilot. Short/put $BA", "selftext": "Here's why:  \n\n\nThere exists a new system on the 737 MAX jets. On all last-gen Boeing jets (and the vast majority of commercial and private jets), there exists systems designed to prevent a stall (the term used to describe the state an aircraft is in when it's currently aerodynamic profile is depriving it of lift to the point where the aircraft will begin to fall). These systems manipulate or provide feedback in the pilot controls to encourage a stall recovery. However these systems are easy to identify and combat, and disable.   \n\n\nThe new system on these jets is a lot more aggressive in how it works to recover from stalls. Many would say pilots are well trained, and that is true. This system is designed to kick off when a pilot makes an instinctive step to control the system, but turns itself back on after five seconds, and there is apparently no button within either pilot's reach to entirely disable the system. In short, if the aircraft believes it is stalling thanks to bad sensor data, it will fight the pilots until the aircraft either gets below 100 feet, or crashes. Although pilots might make the correct moves to combat a normal stall system, they will ultimately lose the battle with a computer that turns itself back on every few seconds.  \n\n\nThe profile for this crash matches almost exactly with that of the Lion Air crash. Specifically, the pilots reported problems right after passing 100 feet after take off (the threshold for the MCAS turning on ), and fought sporadically with the controls until ultimately diving at an incredibly steep angle into the ground. It is very, very likely that MCAS is the cause of this crash.  \n\n\nBoeing and the NTSB are at the crash site at this very moment, and will have figured this out in no time flat. Based on pilot communication and command input, I have no doubt that they will find much the same situation that the Lion Air pilots faced. After fixing the issue, the plane only fights back, until ultimately the pilots are unable to prevent the aircraft from diving.   \n\n\nBut why short/put BA? First, there is an incredible demand for these aircraft and a large number of outstanding orders. I have no doubt that many companies might seek to cancel their orders once this flaw is announced. Second, Boeing **will ground the entire 737 MAX fleet globally until this problem is solved**. This aircraft is already in service around the world and the grounding will cost airlines millions. If nothing else investor reaction to the news will drive the stock price down significantly over the next two weeks. We can also expect Boeing to face punitive action in the EU and US, as Boeing failed to include training material for their new system in the FCOM (basically crew operation training manual) for the aircraft, which is a big no no.  \n\n\nAlso, this looks bad for a brand which should never have allowed an aircraft with these problems to take flight.  \n\n\nFeel free to ask questions.", "created_utc": 1552273273, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/azo3vp/im_a_pilot_shortput_ba/", "is_self": true}
