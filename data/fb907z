There are people in high places talking about more public events being cancelled. There is talk about *all airline traffic being halted*. Boomers make these big decisions, and are the most afraid right now. The dip is not over... not even close. \n\nTrump is the only one who is keeping this market from doing a full, environmentally unfriendly 10 gallon per flush spiral down the shitter tube. I'm sure that once one of his advisors tells him that you can make money when the market goes down, all stops are off. \n\nHow can we take advantage of this? Well, we help give the boomers the nudge they need (they're hesitant to flush the money they need for their 4th rental property - but they'll do it, if it means getting to live to see millennials get ass fucked by the impending climate crisis).\n\nSO:\n\n- If you're not sick, cough in public. Make sniffle noises. Tell people in the grocery store that something has you under the weather, but you're just not sure what. Remind them that you have to go to work because you live paycheck to paycheck and don't want to be kicked out of your 1br apartment. Touch the produce in front of them (wash your hands after - don't be stupid about this). \n\n- If you ARE sick, touch door handles. Make sure to do a little nose wipe beforehand. Touch common surfaces at your workplace. Go to some sporting events, and make sure to pay with the credit card you've been using to cut your dark web Chinese blow.\n\n- BUY MOTHERFUCKING PUTS. Stop trying to call the bottom. A fucking national catastrophe is NOT priced in, from a dip that only took us back to October. \n\nWe have been to the moon, boys, and Neil Armstrong said that getting there isn't the scary part, it's coming back down to Earth that is frightening.
