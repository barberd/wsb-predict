Unfortunately all the brokers here are shit and they could all disappear and it wouldnt affect me.\n\n HL is too expensive and the rest are either fucking complicated to use or they have literally nothing to trade. Only blue chip as if I give a fuck. And dont get me started on the shitty CfDs that this country is infested with. 'Muh free trading'. I have to be 21 to options trade on IBKR and RH doesnt exist and thats a fucking ball slap.\n\nCan i start my own brokerage that allows me to invest and trade in what I want and if so what do I need?", "created_utc": 1575935031, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e8i6cv/help_need_advice/", "is_self": true}
