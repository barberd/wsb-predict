FB -1.47% officials say they try to avoid political bias. Try telling that to Democrats.\n\nThe relationship between the company and the political left is at an all-time low, more than a dozen Democratic operatives, campaign officials and leaders of progressive groups said in interviews, following a series of company policy decisions widely seen among their ranks as favoring President Trump. Many Democrats and campaign officials are increasingly criticizing Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg in personal terms.\n\nIt is a stark departure from the 2016 campaign, when Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton. The relationship has frayed partly because of actions Facebook took to address criticisms of bias from conservatives and in part owing to revelations from U.S. intelligence and special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on how Russia used Facebook to spread disinformation to boost Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nOn the campaign trail and in Democratic political circles, there is little love left for the Silicon Valley giant, even as presidential candidates on both sides of the aisle rely on Facebook as a valuable platform for political advertising.\n\nThis month, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, former Vice President Joe Biden and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer all lambasted Facebook over misleading videos, ads and hate speech on the platform. Mrs. Clinton recently called Mr. Zuckerberg authoritarian. Those public remarks came after behind-the-scenes discussions between Facebook and Democrats about whether the company was allowing harmful discourse ahead of the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cProgressives think the way Facebook has permitted and amplified disinformation has become antithetical to a well-functioning democracy,\u201d Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, a progressive think tank, said in an interview.\n\nFacebook representatives say the company is in an awkward position. Democrats want the company to fulfill its promise to combat misinformation, but conservatives argue that the fact-checking groups employed by Facebook are liberal and could unfairly limit their speech.\n\n\u201cPeople on both sides of the aisle disagree with some of the positions we\u2019ve taken, but we remain committed to seeking outside perspectives and communicating clearly about why we make the decisions we do,\u201d a Facebook spokesman said in an emailed statement.\n\nThe social media platform remains a major part of campaign infrastructure.\n\n\u201cFacebook is the big bad ugly, but you talk to operatives about where they\u2019re spending their money and it\u2019s Facebook,\u201d said Tim Lim, a Democratic digital strategist.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren and some other presidential candidates are pushing for a breakup of the company, and the Massachusetts lawmaker\u2019s campaign asks supporters to confirm they aren\u2019t an executive at a big tech company before donating to her.\n\nStill, she has put more than $6.8 million into Facebook ads since the start of 2019. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has also been critical of the company, spent more than $7 million in that time. Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign put more than $22 million toward Facebook ads during the period.\n\nMr. Lim said campaign officials feel they have no choice but to buy Facebook ads because voters spend so much time on the platform.\n\nNot every campaign is keeping Silicon Valley at arm\u2019s length. A Facebook board member, Jeffrey Zients, who was National Economic Council director during the Obama administration, is backing Mr. Biden for president. He welcomed the former vice president to his Washington home for an evening fundraiser in November. He is among a number of co-hosts for a February fundraising event as well, according to an invitation reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nMr. Biden has said it is worth taking a \u201creally hard look\u201d at breaking up tech companies including Facebook.\n\nConservatives have long complained of bias in Silicon Valley. In 2016, employees of Facebook donated almost 100 times more to Mrs. Clinton than Mr. Trump, according to federal data. That spring, conservatives were in an uproar after the tech-news site Gizmodo reported that the company altered a list of trending topics to suppress conservative content.\n\nFacebook denied the Gizmodo article, but several conservatives visited the company\u2019s headquarters to discuss the issue.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg has relied on advice from Peter Thiel, a longtime Facebook board member and Trump backer. Joel Kaplan, one of Facebook\u2019s top policy executives and a former aide to President George W. Bush, has sometimes postponed or killed projects that risk upsetting the political right, the Journal has previously reported.\n\nWhile Facebook was repairing its relationship with conservatives, many Democrats soured on the company.\n\nLast year, Facebook refused to take down a video that had been altered to appear to show Mrs. Pelosi slurring her words. Facebook executives were divided on how to handle the video but fell back on the stance that a tech company shouldn\u2019t be the arbiter of truth, people familiar with the matter say.\n\nFollowing that same logic, Facebook said in late September that it wouldn\u2019t fact-check posts, images or ads from politicians on the platform. In October, Facebook allowed an ad run by Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign that included a claim about Mr. Biden\u2019s role in the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor. The former vice president\u2019s campaign said the claim was false.\n\nIn an Oct. 4 letter, the Biden campaign accused the company of selling \u201cthe tools to target certain segments of the population with lies.\u201d Facebook\u2019s global head of elections policy, Katie Harbath, who previously worked with Republicans, responded that the company strove to \u201cempower voters to judge what politicians say for themselves.\u201d The New York Times earlier reported the email exchange, which the Journal also reviewed.\n\nThe Biden campaign then urged Facebook to remember that it \u201cpromised the public, the United States Congress, and its users\u2026that its platform will no longer be a conduit for misinformation and a tool of political distortion.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Facebook stood by its decision to allow political ads to be targeted to small segments of American voters, unlike moves by its competitors Google and Twitter Inc. Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign used this method to reach narrow voter groups in 2016. Some Democrats say such targeting can make it hard to detect misinformation, even though others in the party have also used the tactic.\n\nMs. Sandberg has told Democratic operatives that the decisions are tough to make, according to people familiar with those conversations. One person characterized Ms. Sandberg\u2019s behind-the-scenes position as: \u201cI\u2019m a Democrat, this is so hard for me.\u201d\n\nIn some discussions with Democrats, Facebook staffers describe Facebook as the public\u2019s \u201cfavorite punching bag,\u201d this person said.\n\nA senior Biden campaign official said Facebook had been \u201cnominally cooperative\u201d in making people from the company available to talk about policy differences. The official said Facebook had notified the campaign after a video surfaced on the platform that had been edited in a way that changed the meaning of remarks by the vice president, which Mr. Biden\u2019s allies said made the comments sound racist.\n\n\u201cThe thing that I have taken away from all of our interactions with them is that they realize that misinformation is a problem that for PR reasons they realize they need to talk about,\u201d this person said.\n\n\u201cThey understand they have an optics problem,\u201d the Biden official said.", "created_utc": 1580482922, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ewpnrx/facebooks_relationship_with_democrats_hits_a_low/", "is_self": true}
