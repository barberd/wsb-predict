He was a man of about 40, posting a friendly inquiry onto LinkedIn this year with pictures of a metal sphere he didn\u2019t recognize deep inside an American Airlines jet. He had no idea what it was.\n\n\u201cHi everyone. This component is located on the Engine Rolls Royce Trent 800,\u201d wrote the mechanic, in broken English, smiling in his profile picture next to an AA passenger plane. \u201cDoes someone could give me a technical information\u2026? What is the function of that component \u2026.? I searched long about it, and I did not find\u2026\u201d\n\nThis earnest message, sent by a technician proudly identifying himself as an American Airlines employee in Brazil, was received with alarm by his colleagues in the United States. If this foreign worker was unable to even identify the equipment in front of him, located on a Boeing 777 jet, how was he supposed to fix it?\n\nIt was more evidence of risks to passengers and crew as domestic air carriers increasingly use offshore repair centers in South America and Asia, where standards can be lower in crucial areas of safety, training, and worker competence. Crowdsourcing technical knowledge falls far short of what is required to keep these exceedingly complicated airplanes flying safely.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a disaster waiting to happen,\u201d\u00a0John Samuelsen, president of the 150,000-member Transport Workers Union, told Capital &amp; Main.\n\nIn 2003, according to TWU, only 7% of repair work was being done overseas. Now it is 30%. There are more than 900 foreign repair stations currently certified by the Federal Aviation Administration\u2014including a new $100 million aircraft maintenance facility in S\u00e3o Paulo. American Airlines alone employs about 400 technicians on foreign soil.\n\u201cIn South America or in China, the workers that they hire are not required to go through the same rigorous testing and certification,\u201d said Samuelsen. \u201cNo criminal background checks, no random drug testing, no certification requirements that exist with the airline carriers in America", "created_utc": 1564614474, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ckfzdc/this_has_to_be_the_most_negligent_thing_ive_seen/", "is_self": true}
