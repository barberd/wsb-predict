As an aside, hindsight shows regardless of if you think the play is the right one or not, I made many mistakes executing it. First, I'll review. Then I'll look to next week.\n\n# How I Put My Money In\n\n[Buy High, Sell Low](https://preview.redd.it/0ueiabxtr7v41.png?width=1192&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc74449eed748419977cd8ddbeef3de6997ec01a)\n\nIn reviewing the play I wanted to make, I decided early last week to create the plan and run with it. General belief being we would rise, then begin a descent. Not knowing when the descent would be, I wanted to average into the rise, putting progressively more of the money allocated to the play in as we rose.\n\n**On 4/21** I FOMO'd in. This was a mistake (#1), and something done against my better judgement. I deployed 29% of the play's capital into this mistake, another mistake (#2). To exacerbate issues, I bought 5/30 puts, another mistake (#3), and wish these were 6/30 or 9/18 buys. In hindsight, I should have trusted my own DD, and waited for the rebound, also should have allocated no more than 15% in my initial buy, and the initial buys early on the way up should have been longer dated, finishing with the early dates.\n\n**On 4/22** I had recognized the FOMO, gotten frustrated with own ineffectiveness, and wanted to be more mindful. I deployed another 22% across two buying windows. Neither perfect, but both fit the general play.\n\n**On 4/23** I deployed all remaining cash, 49% of total play. These buys were mostly 9/18 puts, again in hindsight I made a mistake (#4) in the way I played the dates, one that exacerbates initial losses and will make decisions around modifying harder and more costly. There are a few other mistakes mixed in as well.\n\nAll told I deployed 29.34% on 4/21, another 21.56% on 4/22, and 49.1% on 4/23. I'm allocated 14.62% to 5/29, 45.14% to 6/30, and 40.25% to 9/18 puts.\n\n# Terrifying, You Silly Normie! Now what?\n\nNow I look ahead. I talked last time about each day being a coin flip, normalizing to the macro reality over time. I talked about a head and shoulder's pattern, and news being straw on a camel's back. I think the market is moving to a CRITICAL week. My belief is this week is either going to break us out of channel, sending us to test the 290-300 range and seeing me exit this play at a significant loss ... or ... we'll break channel lower, which I see as more likely, but not guaranteed. Let's look at some key aspects:\n\n* [Housing Market Forebearances](https://www.ccn.com/the-housing-market-is-edging-dangerously-close-to-a-1-trillion-reckoning/) \\- The housing market saw 500k loans go into forbearance in a week, a 9% jump, taking a total to 4.1 million people unable to pay their mortgage on about 1 trillion dollars in principal. Needless to say, not great.\n* The Fed - They meet this week, negative interest rates are on the table, they're the bull saviors, and it's going to be an extremely interesting meeting. I expect an in-channel Monday. Tuesday we ride.\n* [DIX, GEX, VIX](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7x0ub/dix_gex_and_vix_an_analysis_by_a_degenerate/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) \\- Things are shaping up bearish. Terrific write up on these indicators. This is not a guarantee, but it's something.\n* Kim Jong Un - No one want's further global destabilization, it's been nice for the past 6 months with North Korea mostly quiet. Adding fuel back to this region isn't a positive, things are also still inconclusive, but there's a ton of smoke.\n* [Tech Earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4q8u6/daily_discussion_thread_for_april_20_2020/) \\- Is this a buy the expectation sell the earnings setup? A HUGE percentage of the SPY's market cap reports earnings this week, and it's going to set support, or kick out a critical prop.\n* Oil - Is anyone really surprised?\n* General News - Disney closed until 2021? Georgia opening, Trump drives a bus over them? Sniffing clorox as treatment? Boeing backing out of merger? Upcoming GDP numbers, pending home sales numbers? The list goes on.\n\nBottom line, there's a lot of straw.\n\n# Coiled like a spring in our channel\n\nThe market doesn't know which way it's going. I've made my bet, let's look:\n\n[Extremely Tight](https://preview.redd.it/7dlrksmwr7v41.png?width=1187&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ebdb2c100e663caea4c0af9a168df52ebf05d80)\n\nLook at the channel we entered on 4/9. We had a test up, a test down, and otherwise played between 276 and 284. The market is waiting, coiling, and you're going to see significant movement this week, so whatever direction you believe in, place your bets now. I think Monday stays in channel, the fun begins mid-week.\n\nGOOG reports earnings on 4/28, they got out ahead and slashed their advertising budget by 50%. Hmm. A company driven by advertising, slashed their advertising in half. I don't expect a lot of positive vibes here. Expect Facebook to be in the same boat. Discover detailed [a nasty drop in consumer spending](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/24/discover-card-ceo-details-drop-in-spending-with-travel-down-99percent.html), I don't see that playing well for Apple or Tesla. Even Amazon, I'll be watching their business with curiosity. I think things shake out well for them long term, but I don't expect things to be all roses in the short term, I think they're going to have a hard time meeting the expectations the market's set for them.\n\nMy belief is the coiled market makes a run to the top of the channel (284-287), and collapses on itself like a dying star, exploding out to the downside, back to test the low 260's. I'm not much a fan of Forbes, but I will steal some graphics from [a recent article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2020/04/23/the-crash-of-2020-is-todays-oil-chart-tomorrows-sp-500-chart/#5e6addce73ec):\n\n[Possibility 1](https://preview.redd.it/bmwybdjyr7v41.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5ff5cec394210e6e5d2b38863793ca83af3b6929)\n\n[Possibility 2](https://preview.redd.it/31e3vqn0s7v41.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7fcf5137b177153787aff9e314b3351c57751cfc)\n\nMy macro view fits the latter graph, as is likely obvious. But I recognize the possibility of a test downward, the bulls eating enough straw to keep the camel standing, and a firm rebound to the upside. I find it hard to see a third possibility where we immediately use the coil to push out of this channel to test 300, but while no visual for it, I accept it as a possible outcome.\n\nI knew I wanted to run this play, and set out to do just that. I have regrets, could have deployed better, but have no qualms about detailing and making the play. It's going to be a crazy week.\n\n# Updates\n\nWill add thoughts here over the coming days.", "created_utc": 1587929546.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g8krsz/the_normie_playbook_a_terrifying_spy_update/", "is_self": true}
