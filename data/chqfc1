A few hours later I thought about it and figured, \"ah yeah probably not a good idea anyways.\"  \n\nWoke up this morning to find out they were in fact market orders for like 60 days or whatever the fuck the limit is, and so they went through this morning.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven though they executed at 0.27, and were worth 0.12 when I woke up, they're now chillin at 30% (couldve been like 300% if I just bought them in the morning but I digress).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMade me wonder what you autists have done on accident with more than your spare change.", "created_utc": 1564074114, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/chqfc1/whats_your_biggest_accidental_gainloss/", "is_self": true}
