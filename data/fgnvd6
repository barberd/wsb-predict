{"id": "fgnvd6", "title": "Disney is severely undervalued", "selftext": "Alright, so I know this place has turned into a gay bear orgy over the past few weeks, but I'm here to tell the straights and bulls who are just experimenting in college how to make some serious tendies without feeling dirty.\n\nCurrently, Disney is trading below 110, putting it at the same levels as it was in late March of 2019. So right off the bat, its priced at the same level as it was before several very important factors were priced in:\n\n1. The Disney-Fox merger being approved.\n\n2.  Disney+ release and demonstrated success.\n\n3. Galaxy Edge opening.\n\n4. Increased stake in Hulu.\n\n\"But wait!\", I can hear you saying, \"They must be losing SO much revenue from their parks being closed!\"\n\nYes and no. While parks are undoubtedly a big source of revenue for the company, in recent years, their media networks have edged them out as the top dog, while also being more profitable due to lower operating costs.   This is a trend which is likely to continue as their streaming services gain a greater foothold, and will more than make up for the steady decline of traditional tv services. \n\nNow, having established that parks are not actually the biggest moneymaker for the mouse, we will to figure out what exactly the impact to that revenue stream would be. Chinese parks have already begun reopening, and were closed for just the tail end of the Chinese New Year rush and the following month, which would have tapered off significantly in crowds anyway. We can project the same results to US parks and estimate about a months hit to park revenue, followed by a short slump and then normal operations. This means that March and most of April may be more or less out, but we can expect normal operations by June on. Peak Season.\n\nSo looking at perhaps a 10 percent disruption to operations of a revenue stream which only provides 24-26% of Disney total revenue, how much did the stock drop? Over 25 percent.\n\nNow, when you consider how blue chip Disney is, and the short time frame we can apply to the disrupting effect, I expect to see a major rally for $DIS in the next 1-2 months, most likely correcting to the high 130s or low 140s as value investors realize how oversold it has become over corona fears. Buying calls in this range to the low 150s for late June through next year could result in serious tendies.\n\nTLDR;  The mouse always gets his cheese. 7/17 $140 calls.", "created_utc": 1583884993.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fgnvd6/disney_is_severely_undervalued/", "is_self": true}
