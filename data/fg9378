{"id": "fg9378", "title": "$PTON DD Inside", "selftext": "While the bears have been making tendies, I have studied the bike & tread. $PTON DD below. Significant risk and lots of competition in the fitness and bike at home space with cheap alternatives, but I believe PTON is poised to go to the moon. \n  \n\n**Subscriber Count:**\n\n* Connected Fitness Subscribers ($39 per month): 712k \n\n* Digital Subscribers ($12.99 month): 109k \n\n* Projecting upwards of 930k Connected Fitness Subscribers by 6/30/2020 \n\n* 2 million total users. Includes users on shared subscriptions, apartment users, etc. \n\n\n**Pricing:**\n\n* Bike: $2,245 over 39 months. 0% interest. $58 per month. \n\n* Tread: $4,295 over 39 months. 0% interest. $111 per month. \n\n* All-In Cost: $39 membership + $58 bike = $97 total. $48.50 per person for a couple.  \n\n* Competitor Pricing (SoulCycle/Flywheel): Approximately $25 per class, avg 2.5 times per week. Let\u2019s assume $25 per class and 9 times a month. Single user cost = $225. Your wife and her boyfriend cost = $450. \n\n* With the financing option, PTON looks relatively reasonably priced and any millennial making over $50k a year could afford this by simply boozing 1 less time a month and saving $100.  \n\n  \n\n**Financial Outlook:**\n\n* $435MM revenues in FY 2018, $915MM in FY 2019, and FY 2020 expectations of $1.5Bn+. \n\n* $-122MM net income in FY 2019, losses will likely continue through FY 2021 as the Company ramps up the infrastructure.  I\u2019d bet on a profitable quarter by end of 2021 or sometime in 2022. \n\n* Current recurring revenues based on subscriber counts annualize somewhere around $500MM and quickly growing. This is where the real money is made, it\u2019s not just a piece of equipment but a recurring subscription just like Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, etc. \n\n* Margins should significantly improve as subscribers increase. Current subscription margins are ~60%.  \n\n \n**Subscriber Retention:** \n\nRelatively low churn rate and sticky membership. No one wants to cancel a membership after they already purchased a bike for $2k. The brand is strong with 30+ live trainers that users feel a connection with. All data and ride history is stored and you can share and compete with friends. Changing bike platforms ultimately becomes a bit more of an inconvenience for this reason.  \n\n\n**Competition:** \n\nPTON recently settled a lawsuit with Flywheel in which Flywheel admitted to copying parts of PTON\u2019s technology and leaderboards. Flywheel shut down its online classes and PTON even offered users to trade in their bikes for a free PTON bike.  \n\n\nSoulCycle just announced an at-home bike with a retail price of $2,500. It looks like they will not offer live classes, and just on demand classes. I can\u2019t see this posing a significant threat with the price range above the PTON bike and without live classes. \n\n\n**Market Conditions:**\n\nThe fitness and wellness market is massive and growing. Even with a small market share in the overall fitness market, a strong market share in the at-home cycling niche can be substantial. PTON has branded well and seems to fit right along with the BECKY lifestyle that I wouldn\u2019t want to bet against.  \n\nNot sure how ultimately significant the coronavirus impact will be, but with the scare going on that could last months, it\u2019s reasonable to expect a slight uptick in sales/subscribers from consumers wanting to work out at home.  \n\n \n**Positions:** \n\nPersonally, have been loading up on shares as the premiums have sky-rocketed but here are the plays I\u2019d make:  \n\n* Short-term: $22 puts 3/27. Likely will trend downwards with the market until better news.\n\n* Longer term: $30 calls 7/17. Feel very good about next earnings and overall market rebound.", "created_utc": 1583818965.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fg9378/pton_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
