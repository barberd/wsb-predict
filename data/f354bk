{"id": "f354bk", "title": "This is no longer the WSB I knew and loved", "selftext": "A few weeks ago we were coming up with the best ways to make money off of people dying of a scary new disease. Or we came up with schemes to buy enough property in Detroit take over the city. We used to discuss the most unethical of trading strategies. Now we have a huge influx of options newbies buying my MSFT calls, and you all try to either scare them away with this \"save yourself before you lose all your money!!!!\" pussy mentality, or ban them instantly (neither of which seems to really be working). That's what I suggest a new strategy, to solve the problem of all these newbies AND bring back the good old fashioned WSB scheming:\n\nStep 1: Do exactly what we've always done, and hype up some stupid ass calls because one member here made a lot of money off of them, but post the play once its far too late and everyone has caught on.\n\nStep 2: Sell the calls the next day to all the noobs who will have previously checked WSB at 10pm after their favorite Fortnite Stream ends.\n\nStep 3: Make a ton of money because these idiots are buying ridiculously OTM calls that are now in way higher demand than they should be.\n\nStep 4: They lose all their money and can no longer subscribe to their favorite Fortnite streamer, blame WSB, leave, and never return. \n\nAnd there you have it, we chase off the newbies after we drain what little money they haven't already spent on Mt. Dew and Doritos. Then we'll have our yachts and blow, and return to the glory days of WSB. \n\nEither that or by some miracle the stocks actually go up, and we lose money, as is tradition. Either way we'll be staying true to our principles.", "created_utc": 1581571921, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f354bk/this_is_no_longer_the_wsb_i_knew_and_loved/", "is_self": true}
