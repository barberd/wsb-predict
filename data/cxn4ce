{"id": "cxn4ce", "title": "AEO DD", "selftext": "American Eagle Earnings coming up, which means it's almost time to bet wrong on retail. I've been doing research and asking females what the deal is. \n\nCons: \n\n1. Exposure to delayed (to December) round of tariffs will impact revenue (tariff is 10%) and could hurt guidance. \"A 10% tariff would slice 13% off American Eagle\u2019s earnings before interest and taxes\" - some nerd\n2. Sounds like Abercrombie and Fitch, which is a meme company and is going bankrupt. Things that sound similar move similarly.\n3. Empowers overweight people in marketing campaigns, which in turn helps normalize higher risks of diabetes and heart disease \n\nPros: \n\n1. Jeans. AEO is becoming the female jean powerhouse (#1 with womyns, #2 overall), my girlfriends sister ordered $250 of jeans online from AEO just yesterday (this will boost sales numbers) \n2. Asked my 12 year old sister about Ulta last week, she told me it was \"terrible\" and to stay away. I asked her about American Eagle, the oracle said \"thumbs up.emoji\"\n\nConclusion \n\n1. Every female I asked (2.5) gave positive reviews of American Eagle, but when I asked for their positions, I got no response. - gay, 9/13 16p it is", "created_utc": 1567200117, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cxn4ce/aeo_dd/", "is_self": true}
