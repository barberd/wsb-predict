A couple people have commented COOP - Mr. Cooper has a $548B servicing portfolio, which is massive. They aren\u2019t a bank and are solely a mortgage lender/servicer, so I do like that play.\"\n\nSo I guess not entirely his call, but still a good call in general. 10/16 COOP 5p up 46% today.\n\nedit: Part 2 here.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fud5av/mortgage_servicing_crisis_2_forbearance/", "created_utc": 1585966641.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fulkzo/4_days_ago_uhowgreatareyourdanes_predicted/", "is_self": true}
