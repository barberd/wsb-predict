But I've just started reading a book about him (The Snowball) and right off the bat, when talking at the Sun Valley rich people gathering in 1999, I found his speech interesting as hell, especially in these times and especially the 2 thoughts:\n\n1: \"In the short run, the market is a voting machine. In the long run, it's a weighing machine. Weight counts *eventually.* But votes count in the *short term.* And it's a very undemocratic way of voting. Unfortunately, they have no literacy tests in terms of voting qualifications, as you've all learned.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2: \"Ultimately, the value of the stock market could only reflect the *output of the economy.*\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn his speech he is mostly talking about the internet boom that was happening exactly at the time and in the crowd were many internet-related company CEOs and founders that sold their companies like hot cakes in the stock market. He pointed out that basically (as you can see at the bottom of the page in the picture) that everybody invested in internet stocks were about to get screwed because of their overvaluation on, basically, puff (no earnings, no profits, no nothing) which we are seeing a lot of today.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also like the oil prospector analogy which, oh boy oh boy, is true now more than ever, when literally everybody is buying on rumors and pumps.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me know what you think.\n\n*(I am currently 100% in BOX for the earnings run-up, then strictly cash, as I believe the market has to* ***eventually*** *weigh in the goddamn fuckeduppery that is going on in the economy right now.*  CFD's with 5x leverage on BOX. Avg. open @ 16.73.)\n\n[Yes yes not the best quality, deal with it.](https://preview.redd.it/mjaf27j39q051.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ac12c1991e5b53292b1184e2d88b5269a6666c4e)", "created_utc": 1590332341.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gpr160/warren_might_be_smarter_than_the_average_joe/", "is_self": true}
