WAIT TILL THE END OF THE WEEK, AFTER ALL THE DUST SETTLES YOU WILL ALL FINALLY SEE THAT I AM A GOOD TRADER!\n\n\n\nAMC 16.5 calls May 3rd- Highest sales ever with end game, It might be a good idea to buy shares premarket monday if you want to harness the full pop.\n\nMRK $79 calls May 10th- The stock bottomed out on April 18th. ER is coming this week and it will likely beat earnings. It is also on a confirmed uptrend. \n\nCVS calls- been consolidating for while, CVS has expanded into Target stores, it's more diversified than other retailers. CVS is very low due to sympathy with the Walgreens dip rather than its own merit. CVS has a lot of room to run post earnings.\n\nBP $44.5 calls May 10th- Had a big drop with huge sell off, RSI is extremely low. It will run up into earnings this week. I\u2019d recommend selling right before ER for this one. XOM had a bad ER, BP\u2019s ER could reflect the same. \n\nGE $10 calls May 10th- High risk high reward play 50/50 chance. The expectations are already extremely low. If it can beat expectations there could be an 8% upwards move. Expectations shouldn't be hard to beat. Overall GE is a shit company and I wouldn\u2019t hold this for long.\n\nPFE  $41 calls May 10th- Earnings have historically been good for the Q1 ER. Stock is on an uptrend. \n\nAMD $31 calls May 10th- Playstation 5 confirmed they\u2019re using AMD\u2019s chips. ER could miss or beat. The main thing going for AMD is guidance will likely be raised due to the playstation deal. \n\nAMGN $190 May 10th- RSI solid, MACD confirmed uptrend, above the line of resistance. Will likely beat earnings.\n\n\nYou can thank me for making you a fuck ton of money here: gf.me/u/sg8uw4", "created_utc": 1556511789, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bikpd8/the_official_joco645_watchlist/", "is_self": true}
