{"id": "e6z1ac", "title": "$CHK DD", "selftext": "Chesapeake Energy, an oil and natural gas producer, added a warning in their most recent 10Q of the possibility of breaching debt covenants in the short-term, which could bring their massive \\~$10B pile of debt due, cause on run on their assets, and in all likelihood force the company into bankruptcy. When investors saw this in the 10Q they panicked and dumped the stock, sending it down more than 50% in a month after already dropping from a high of $3.40 this year and $26 in 2015, however, they're wrong.\n\nTaken from the SEC's Financial Reporting Manual, this disclosure is required for one of two reasons:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**9210.5** It may be necessary for the liquidity and capital resources discussion to address debt instruments, guarantees and related covenants. Disclosure is likely to be necessary if:\n\n1. The registrant is, or is reasonably likely to be, in breach of debt covenants or\n2. Debt covenants impact the registrant's ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing.\n\nIn my opinion, the only reason for the disclosure here is #2 as they're stretched too thin to accumulate more debt, especially as their existing financial covenants tighten. More on this below.\n\n## The Trade\n\nLong call spreads expiring Jan 2021 at the $0.50/$1.50 strike at a debit per contract of $0.23 (as of Dec 4).\n\n**Upside** is roughly 4:1 on this trade, assuming CHK avoids bankruptcy, reduces fear of insolvency, and returns to a share price they maintained as recently as November 4th.\n\n**Breakeven** is effectively at the current price.\n\n**Downside** is the debit paid of $0.23 per contract if CHK is at or below $0.50 in Jan 2021.\n\n## The Setup\n\nNatural Gas and Oil prices have been historically low, putting substantial strain on a company already burdened with a mountain of debt. This has put pressure on CHK to make significant concessions in order to maintain its financial covenants.\n\nTaken straight from the latest 10-Q:\n\n&gt;*The Chesapeake revolving credit facility is subject to various financial and other covenants. The terms of the Chesapeake credit agreement include covenants limiting, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans, incur liens, consummate mergers and similar fundamental changes, make restricted payments, make investments in unrestricted subsidiaries and enter into transactions with affiliates. T****he Chesapeake credit agreement contains financial covenants that require us to maintain (i) a leverage ratio, which is the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated EBITDAX, each as defined in the Chesapeake credit agreement to exclude amounts associated with unrestricted subsidiaries, of not more than 5.50 to 1 through the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2019, which threshold decreases by 25 basis points each quarter until it reaches 4.00 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2021 and every quarter thereafter, (ii) a secured leverage ratio of not more than 2.50 to 1.00 until the later of (x) the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2021 or (y) the first fiscal quarter in which the Company\u2019s leverage ratio does not exceed 4.00 to 1.00 and (iii) a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 2.00 to 1.00 through the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2019; not less than 2.25 to 1.00 through the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2020; and not less than 2.50 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2020 and every quarter thereafter***\\*.\\*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***As of September 30, 2019, we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants*** *under the credit agreement and we were able to borrow up to the full availability under the Chesapeake revolving credit facility and had $1.443 billion of borrowing capacity thereunder.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves that may be economically produced. Historically, oil and natural gas prices have been volatile, and may be subject to wide fluctuations in the future.* ***If continued depressed prices persist, combined with the scheduled reductions in the leverage ratio covenant, our ability to comply with the leverage ratio covenant during the next 12 months will be adversely affected which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.*** *Failure to comply with this covenant, if not waived, would result in an event of default under our Chesapeake revolving credit facility, the potential acceleration of outstanding debt thereunder and the potential foreclosure on the collateral securing such debt, and could cause a cross-default under our other outstanding indebtedness.* ***We are actively pursuing with support from the Board of Directors a variety of transactions and cost-cutting measures, including but not limited to, reduction in corporate discretionary expenditures, refinancing transactions by us or our subsidiaries, capital exchange transactions, asset divestitures, reductions in capital expenditures by approximately 30% in 2020 and operational efficiencies.*** *We believe it is probable that these measures, as we continue to implement them, will enable us to comply with our leverage ratio covenant.*\n\nThese warnings have caused the stock to plummet, however from the management notes we are able to simply compare the current state versus those required by the covenants:\n\n&gt;***Our total leverage ratio was approximately 3.88 to 1.00, our first lien secured leverage ratio was approximately 0.74 to 1.00 and our interest coverage ratio was approximately 3.55 to 1.00***\n\nThe present state is well within the covenants imposed by the Chesapeake credit agreement, both presently and as the covenants tighten, and the following outlines reasons to believe this will remain the case.\n\n## In Support of the Trade\n\n* Operating Expenses down YOY and QOQ, with further cuts coming along with a 30% reduction in capital expenditures for 2020 which would free up \\~$600m based on the 2019 CapEx of $2.1b\n* A large portion of losses are due to non-cash line items including a hefty depreciation/amortization charge, which can be deferred in the short term to pay off debts.\n* They\u2019ve shown that there is an appetite for some debt holders to be converted into equity\n* Acquisition of Wildhorse in Feb 2019 gave a substantial boost to production. For this acquisition 717.4m shares were used (along with $381m cash) for a total acquisition price of $2.4b (plus $1.4b in debt assumed), yet those shares are now worth only \\~$538m for an acquisition price today of $919m. Essentially, this was a steal.\n* Only \\~$300m senior notes due in 2020 and another \\~$300m due 2021, with a total of $208m due in the next 12 months. This shouldn\u2019t be overly difficult to manage in the short term, especially with a reduction in CapEx of \\~$600m\n* \\~$1.5b available under the Chesapeake revolving credit facility (Due 2023), giving liquidity\n* Fair value of the entirety of the long term debt, based on current market prices for each of the securities, is \\~$2b (20%) less than the amount carried on the balance sheet\n* CHK owns 22m shares of FTSI which can be sold as needed (though only worth \\~$20m at present, as they\u2019re also under stress). Again, this provides some liquidity if needed, particularly if counterparties start to require collateral\n* Over \\~$100m in severance paid due to mass layoffs this year, in particular as part of the Wildhorse acquisition, which is a non-recurring expense\n* **Financial covenants are well within the requirements at present:**\n   * **Leverage Ratio: 3.8:1.0 vs 4.5:1.0 required as of September 2020 and 4.0:1.0 required as of March 2021**\n   * **Secured Leverage Ratio: 0.74:1.0 vs 2.5:1.0 required**\n   * **Interest Coverage Ratio: 3.55:1.0 vs 2.5:1.0 required as of September 2020**\n* Roughly 75% of planned production is hedged to reduce impact of lowered commodity prices and improved ability to predict upcoming financial situation:\n   * Oil: 17 million barrels @ $59.28/barrel ($1.007b)\n   * Gas: 265 billion cubic feet @ $2.76/mcf ($0.731b)\n* This company has plenty of solid assets available to be sold off, as they\u2019ve done in the past. It likely won\u2019t be at prices that benefit long term shareholders, but it gives them options in paying down their debt.\n* Further conversion of notes to equity could terminate tax loss carry forwards, which is one motivation (albeit small) to avoid dilution as a first resort\n* The price of natural gas is already significantly suppressed which is limiting supply, so an improvement in demand could give a nice boost to prices\n\n## Against the Trade\n\n* $9.7b in debt versus limited or zero free cash flow and deteriorating commodity prices\n* Current ratio of 0.6, with almost no cash. This is also exclusive of \\~$100m in notes coming due late 2020\n* Revenue and income down YOY and QOQ\n* Tremendous interest expenses, and growing\n* A number of ongoing lawsuits, though nothing which is overly concerning or significant to the trade\n* Further conversion of notes to equity could terminate tax loss carry forwards, which have helped reduce expenses\n* Most of the debt is secured, leaving virtually nothing for the common in the event of a liquidation\n* Potential for further \\~$350m to be required as collateral by counterparties, which could impact liquidity\n* $92m in dividends payable per year on the preferred shares, not many converting to common\n* The company\u2019s future is very tightly coupled to the price of oil and natural gas, which I don\u2019t have any particular expertise in.\n* Further dilution is a very real possibility as more debt is converted to equity, especially at such reduced share prices driving the conversion rate against the common holders\n\n## Developments\n\n* **December 4th:** Offering to exchange $1.5-$2.34b in debt at 60-70 cents on the dollar to 2025 11% notes (essentially, kicking the can to buy some time)\n* **December 4th:** Arranged a $1.5b loan over 4.5 years which is being used to buy $617m in 2025 notes issues by BLV (subsidiary) for 97 cents on the dollar, as well as expire the BLV revolving credit facility\n\n## Links\n\n* CHK Investor Relations: [http://investors.chk.com/](http://investors.chk.com/)\n* Q3 2019 10Q: [http://app.quotemedia.com/data/downloadFiling?webmasterId=101533&amp;ref=114603354&amp;type=PDF&amp;symbol=CHK&amp;companyName=Chesapeake+Energy+Corporation&amp;formType=10-Q&amp;dateFiled=2019-11-05&amp;CK=895126](http://app.quotemedia.com/data/downloadFiling?webmasterId=101533&amp;ref=114603354&amp;type=PDF&amp;symbol=CHK&amp;companyName=Chesapeake+Energy+Corporation&amp;formType=10-Q&amp;dateFiled=2019-11-05&amp;CK=895126)\n* Q3 2019 Webcast:[https://www.webcaster4.com/Player/Index?webcastId=32049&amp;g=cc8bc588-7697-4bba-a1eb-97ddfb6f1c6e&amp;uid=5493412&amp;sid=](https://www.webcaster4.com/Player/Index?webcastId=32049&amp;g=cc8bc588-7697-4bba-a1eb-97ddfb6f1c6e&amp;uid=5493412&amp;sid=)\n* December 4th debt exchange: [http://investors.chk.com/2019-12-04-Chesapeake-Energy-Corporation-Announces-Private-Exchange-Offers-For-Senior-Notes](http://investors.chk.com/2019-12-04-Chesapeake-Energy-Corporation-Announces-Private-Exchange-Offers-For-Senior-Notes)\n* December 4th offer to buy BLV 2025 notes [http://investors.chk.com/2019-12-04-Chesapeake-Energy-Corporation-Announces-Cash-Tender-Offer-and-Consent-Solicitation-For-6-875-Senior-Notes-Due-2025-Issued-by-Brazos-Valley-Longhorn-L-L-C-and-Brazos-Valley-Longhorn-Finance-Corp-Its-Wholly-Owned-Subsidiaries](http://investors.chk.com/2019-12-04-Chesapeake-Energy-Corporation-Announces-Cash-Tender-Offer-and-Consent-Solicitation-For-6-875-Senior-Notes-Due-2025-Issued-by-Brazos-Valley-Longhorn-L-L-C-and-Brazos-Valley-Longhorn-Finance-Corp-Its-Wholly-Owned-Subsidiaries)\n* December 4th arranged $1.5b term loan[http://investors.chk.com/2019-12-04-Chesapeake-Energy-Corporation-Announces-Arrangement-Of-1-5-Billion-Term-Loan-Facility](http://investors.chk.com/2019-12-04-Chesapeake-Energy-Corporation-Announces-Arrangement-Of-1-5-Billion-Term-Loan-Facility)\n* Relevant SEC disclosure requirement: [https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/cf-manual/topic-9](https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/cf-manual/topic-9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**: CHK is going to die a long and painful death, but it won't be in the short term, and they won't breach the covenants which have everyone shaking in their boots.
