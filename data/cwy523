{"id": "cwy523", "title": "Why are we up this week? Explainer.", "selftext": "**Disclaimer:** I'm long 9/13 2900/2770 puts and this development isn't ideal. This position is now way more of a gamble than originally intended, but two weeks is a long time in this market. The bear thesis is that tariffs do not get delayed over the long weekend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Here's how market works - skip if you're not totally retarded:**\n\nMarket is forward looking and assesses the risk of future events, repricing to levels reflecting that risk. So when Trump is going on an angry tweet binge, \"hereby ordering\" US companies to leave China and calling Xi the enemy, market is expecting more of that in the future days. It drops further than it's warranted just by what has been said, in order to reflect the risk of further negative headlines.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Explainer:**\n\n***Futures open on Sunday night. Situation:***\n\n* Trump is mega pissed off - he is upset about JPow and upset about China extra tariffs\n* Market is scared - more escalation coming from China, talks definitely NOT happening for the foreseeable future\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Market opens on Monday. Situation:***\n\n* ~~Trump is mega pissed off - he is upset about JPow and upset about China extra tariffs~~\n   * Trump is calling Xi a great leader, and he also signalled readiness to talk with China by making up a phone call. If he was still angry, he'd say something like \"China called but I slammed the phone!\". \n* Market is still scared of escalation from China - there is a sense of unease as China doesn't say anything positive, but does say that the call didn't happen.\n\nMarket is no longer expecting further aggressive headlines from Trump - it needs to remove this risk from the current level. So it goes back up a bit.\n\n***Thursday, 5h before market open. Situation:***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* ~~Trump is mega pissed off - he is upset about JPow and upset about China extra tariffs~~\n* ~~Market is still scared of escalation from China - there is a sense of unease as China doesn't say anything positive, but does say that the call didn't happen.~~\n   * Gao Yan, Vice Minister of Commerce of PRC speaks. Multiple headlines signalling that China will not retaliate to Trump's escalation on Friday. Potential visit to US in September. Discuss removing new tariffs. \n\nMarket is no longer expecting futher aggressive headlines from Trump, and it's no longer expecting a swift retaliation from China. It needs to remove the retaliation risk from the current traded level, and so it rallies.\n\nFor completeness sake, here's a full rundown of headlines:\n\n\\*CHINESE COMMERCE MINISTRY SPOKESMAN GAO SPEAKS IN BEIJING\n\n\\*MOFCOM'S GAO: TRADE ESCALATION NOT GOOD FOR CHINA, U.S., WORLD\n\n\\*MOFCOM'S GAO: **CHINA, U.S. ARE IN EFFECTIVE CONTACT**\n\n\\*MOFCOM'S GAO: **CHINA WON'T DISCRIMINATE AGAINST FOREIGN COS**\n\n\\*MOFCOM'S GAO: **CHINA WON'T CRACKDOWN ON FOREIGN COMPANIES**\n\n\\*GAO: CHINA HAS AMPLE RETALIATION TOOLS TO RESPOND TO NEW TARIFF\n\n\\*GAO: BUT **CHINA THINKS SHOULD DISCUSS REMOVING THE NEW TARIFFS**\n\n\\*GAO: CHINA-U.S. **DISCUSSING ABOUT VISIT TO U.S. IN SEPT.**\n\n\\*GAO: CHINA COMPLAINED TO THE U.S. OVER NEW TARIFFS\n\n\\*GAO: CHINA-U.S. INTERESTS INTERTWINED, CAN'T BE EASILY CUT\n\n\\*GAO: CHINA HOPES U.S. REMOVES NEW TARIFFS", "created_utc": 1567068217, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cwy523/why_are_we_up_this_week_explainer/", "is_self": true}
