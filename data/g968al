Kids are playing games with their friends, and their parents are demanding they use headsets so they don't have to hear it. \n\nIf the parents didn't have a proper desk setup before, they do now, and either their company or they themselves bought keyboards, mice, and webcams to enable it.  If the kids didn't have a headset before, they do now, and once their Turdle Beach headset breaks, they are going to buy something with a bit more quality.\n\nNow, who makes all of this?  Logitech.  They are in a great position to capitalize on all fronts this quarter, and the evidence seems to show they have.\n\nLet's take a quick look through their website.  Here are their webcam offerings.  Ones I've crossed out are out of stock:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/iMBYKvD.png\n\nYeah, every single model is out of stock, even the $200 ones.  Bestbuy.com is sold out of all but the $170 model, Walmart.com has most in stock but at immense markups.\n\nNow, you may say, \"But you can get CHEAPSHIT brand peripherals from Amazon for only $10!\"  Yes, you can, but it seems Logitech as a brand name has immense pull.  Even the resale market for Logitech webcams is having a shortage.  For example, the C310, a long-discontinued model sold for less than $20 new and under $10 used on ebay back in February:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/0okHo4J.png\nNow look at the sales from this week:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/RGjnPy3.png\n\nIf CHEAPSHIT brand truly were good enough, you wouldn't see used prices on decade old Logitech webcams increase this much.  People want their Logitech.\n\nBut what do Logitech's numbers say?  Let's take a look at their last quarterly report: https://i.imgur.com/Jxzu3I5.png\n\nLast quarter PC webcams were only 3.5% of their net sales with a YoY increase of just 3%, but video collaboration was 10% with an increase of 24% YoY.  Video collaboration products are their very expensive camera systems, but now with some offices returning partial workforces, both PC webcams and collaboration cameras will have a massive increase in sales to facilitate meetings.  Gaming makes up over 25% of their net, and we all know the spike gaming has seen.\n\nSo, in short, Logitech is gonna rocket off once their quarterly earnings are out on the 11th.   I know this would have been better to post two weeks ago, but there is absolutely still time to get in.", "created_utc": 1588011705.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g968al/logi_is_about_to_smash_their_alltime_high_due_to/", "is_self": true}
