Here's my situation:\n\nI'm long RGR stock, who reported earning yesterday and had a good day today.  I've made enough to exit the position and take a 20% gain, although I'm fine with holding longer.  The stock is currently priced at $54.50.  18DEC20 $55 calls are selling for $5.60.  So instead of just selling the stock and taking my gain, why not just write those covered calls for the entire lot, let it hit $55 (maybe tomorrow), bank a huge premium and exit the position like i want to anyways?\n\nWhat am i missing?", "created_utc": 1582238547, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7182g/covered_calls_what_am_i_missing/", "is_self": true}
