{"id": "cd90ir", "title": "SPY (SPX) big picture: breakout from 18month consolidation! (this might be just the beginning? where's the top?!)", "selftext": "(this is all my opinion. It IS NOT ADVICE).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoing back to January 2018 to now: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/JZLDPhfi/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/JZLDPhfi/)\n\nWeekly picture: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/Gd0frAGx/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Gd0frAGx/)\n\nAnd let me take you back to 1998 and zoom out on Monthly chart: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/P5fKCQrr/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/P5fKCQrr/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd now we zoom into where we are: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/tyd6LiKw/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/tyd6LiKw/)\n\nYou can see SPY pulled back to make sure the breakout was legit (blue arrows). You can see that we're in new territory and SPY is establishing new support/resistance lines. So if SPY pulls back, wait and see how SPY does at those lines. (Please add an \"ish\" to the end of those three numbers on the chart. For example, 297.20ish). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome thoughts: \n\n**1) Don't call the top and buy puts like a dumb auti until SPY falls back into the shaded box, imo. \\*\\*295\\*\\* The trend is UP right now, people!** If SPY drops below 295, you might try puts because the fall may accelerate. Otherwise, if you're buying puts, (presumably) you're just trying to make money on scalping technical pullbacks (which is difficult but legit and what we all try to do every day (think of ROKU all year). \n\nNote: **for SPX,** the main key battle line is 2954, imo. [https://www.tradingview.com/x/hsCuGL3f/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/hsCuGL3f/)\n\nUnlike many others, I am not of the view that SPY 234 must be retested. \n\n**2) IWM.** SPY and QQQ have been making new ATH's in this raging bull market. Why is IWM lagging so hard? I think it is because small caps are more dependent on debt, and so until there is an OFFICIAL rate cut announced, IWM will lag. But it's gonna fucking FLY when/if a rate cut is officially announced. [https://www.tradingview.com/x/hLQfGz0v/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/hLQfGz0v/)\n\nThe absolute key number for IWM is 160. If it breaks 160 into 161, it will FLY FLY FLY (imo).\n\n **3) AAPL:**  Think of a ticker that hasn't reached a new ATH yet in this raging bull market.... AAPL! sexy gap fill at 210.32\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nwas gonna write more, but i'll just post this as it is now since futures are opening and i got shit to do. may the tendies be with you.", "created_utc": 1563142218, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cd90ir/spy_spx_big_picture_breakout_from_18month/", "is_self": true}
