{"id": "fyixj9", "title": "Expecting 6.6m new unemployment next Thursday (again)", "selftext": "After a successful guess on 6.6m this Thursday, I feel ~~obligated to expand on my viiews and estimatea for next Thursday~~ bored and want to shitpost with the market closed.\n\n12 states recognize today as a state holiday.  Of those 12, 5 (FL, TX, NJ, IN, NC) added over 500k to the 6.6m this week. An interesting note from Thursday's report was NV claims went down, but casinos were shutdown on the 23rd and state went stay at home on the 1st.\n\nNJ, IN, NC have been stay at home since March, so let's assume similar numbers for next week (also, what the shit NC you're losing medical professionals?)\n\nFL went stay at home a week ago and just rolled out a mobile  view to file for unemployment.  Today is a skeleton crew holiday, so would anticipate increases in claims but a week or two lag on processing them or fixing the new site.\n\nTX went stay at home last week.  No app, old system, optional holiday, oil cuts weren't deep enough, so would expect limited work getting done today.\n\nND appears to be the only state staying closed today.  Their rig count numbers lag by 2 months, so perhaps an uptick through end of April just not this Thursday?\n\nWith that said, only in the past week have AL & MO gone stay at home and GA & MS gone shelter in place.  Will expect a slight uptick from these states, even though most manufacturing have already sent out furloughs and firings prior to lockdown.\n\nWhat's my point?  The shitpost about Good Friday reducing numbers of unemployment claims looks wrong.  74m in the last 10 days have been told to keep their nasty asses out of public unless it's essential.  The upticks from their new claims will offset any decreases from states where those eligible to claim have already claimed, plus the log jam of people still unable to file.\n\ntl;dr your lucky number for next Thursday morning are 6.6m and SPY 300.
