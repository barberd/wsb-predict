(Part - 2)", "selftext": "Hey all, just wanted to post an update thread (in lieu of editing the original) for anyone who came along for my ride. \n\nHere\u2019s a synopsis of the original post:\n\nAfter seeing Monday\u2019s huge red candles, I had a moment of autistic clairvoyance where I just \u2018felt\u2019 like the market direction through the week would be as follows- \n\nTuesday, huge recovery. \n\nWednesday, flat. \n\nThursday, massive bloody red. \n\nFriday, moderate recovery. \n\nI invested $30,000 in $SPY on Monday EOD. Capitalized on the Tuesday run-up to the tune of $10,000. I swing-traded a bit through Wednesday and ended up at $45,000. EOD Wednesday I put it ALL into ORCL puts and SPY puts. Came up to about $125,000 when I exited my positions on Thursday. \n\nThe part 2 is because I put all of it into Day0 SPY/ORCL calls and proceeded to bleed through the rest of Thursday\u2019s session (while providing some live updates).\n\nORIGINAL POST LINK::\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nHere\u2019s how things went after Thursday\u2019s session closed. \n\n-I realized soon thereafter that I had a flight TAKING OFF at 7:00am (local, PST). This gave me 30 minutes, if we didn\u2019t taxi sooner, to close or set my positions. \n-I DID not have WIFI available. Hawaiian Airlines does not provide it. \n-6:30am rolls around. I\u2019m frantically refreshing my phone from my airplane seat. Plane starts shutting the doors and taxiing about 30 minutes later. \n-Right at market open, I closed my 600 SPY positions. $42,000 gain. Nailed it. \n-My 4,000 ORCL calls were much harder to offload. I closes 400 at market open (at max profit), but the price started dropping like a rock over the next 30 minutes. At about 7:00am (10:00 EST), I closed 2,600 at a minor loss and said fuck it, let the 1,000 remaining calls ride til market close. \n-Spoiler: they did not ride. 1,000 expired worthless\n\nThe total \u201cdamage\u201d is my portfolio is sitting at $110,000 cash now. That\u2019s $15,000 down from my high yesterday, but still up $80,000 in 3 days. Not too bad, can\u2019t complain. \n\nIf I were able to close all my positions at market open like I had hoped, would be at $160~170k.\n\nHope you guys fared alright. \n\nLinks:\nhttps://imgur.com/2f1euZ9\n\nhttps://imgur.com/AhhWlOK", "created_utc": 1558732201, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bsmbtv/from_30000_on_tuesday_to_part_2/", "is_self": true}
