{"id": "gowmqr", "title": "The case against Synchrony Financial (SYF)", "selftext": "This past February, the Federal Reserve released data that showed US consumers have racked up roughly $930 billion in credit card debt with total household debt surpassing $14 trillion. This unprecedented amount of credit card debt was surveyed at the peak of the longest bull market in our country\u2019s history. Now, just two months removed, I estimate that this figure is easily over $1 trillion dollars as incomes dissipate but household bills continue to mount. Released in conjunction with this report were the default rates\u2014the figures that indicate whether consumers can meet their current debt obligations. The overall rate of borrowers in delinquency was 5.32% in the fourth quarter. On the surface that may seem insignificant, but this level of default is the highest it has been in nearly a decade. This is largely attributable to two things: egregiously high interest rates and excessive borrowing.   \n\n**Current Macroeconomic Conditions**\n\nAs of May 22, over 30 million have applied for unemployment benefits. If reopening is not as seamless as corporations anticipate, this will be an even worse bloodbath.\n  \n**Purpose of Analysis**\n\nTo determine if financial institutions that engage in subprime lending to consumers are fairly priced and to evaluate if opportunities to sell-short exist. For purposes of this analysis, macrolevel government interference and blatant manipulation by the Federal Reserve will not be considered.  \n  \n**Scope of Testing**\n  \nI have selected three financial institutions I believe are the pinnacles of consumer lending: Capital One (\u201cCapital One\u201d), Synchrony Bank (\u201cSynchrony\u201d), and American Express (\u201cAmex\u201d). Capital One and Synchrony cater towards individuals with lower credit scores while American Express is a more stringent lender. As such, I consider Amex to be a tier above the others in terms of credit quality and therefore will be used as the benchmark for the others.   \n  \n**Synchrony Financial (SYF)**\n  \nOn April 22, Synchrony released their 10Q for quarter one of fiscal 2020 (the first quarter impacted by COVID-19). Quarter over quarter, Synchrony has increased their Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) 6% to a rather staggering 11%--nearly doubling their anticipated defaults. Is it sufficient? It might be. However, if we consider the unemployment number to be 26.5 million (the latest benefit filing number) then that equates to 17% of the US working population being out of work. It is not likely all unemployed persons have a credit line with Synchrony nor is it likely that all unemployed will default on their loan commitments. However, it is important to be cognizant of the financial strain companies that rely on receivables will have during this recessionary-like period.   \n  \n10% of Synchrony\u2019s outstanding loans receivable were consolidated in Texas. Texas is an oil-fueled economy and its demand is diminishing. Oil is cyclical and in the past when profits fall, it was not abnormal to see mass layoffs. While not overtly material, this figure may provide a glimpse as to who the clients of Synchrony are.   \n  \n**Evaluation of Financial Position \u2013 Synchrony**  \n  \nRevenues are down 74% QOQ primarily due to a charge to increase CECL. Fundamentally speaking, not much has changed within Synchrony\u2019s operations during Q1. I had expected borrowings to be greater. I anticipate borrowings will increase in Q2 earnings. Synchrony\u2019s balance sheet is stronger than I had expected. I do think operations will struggle for the next 12-18 months due to lingering issues birthed during the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n  \nThe following passage came directly from Synchrony\u2019s 10Q:  \n  \n Asset quality. Prior to COVID-19, we had experienced slightly improving asset quality trends that reflected stable U.S. unemployment rates and consumer confidence. We anticipate that the recent increases in filings for unemployment benefits in the U.S., while partially mitigated by the effects of governmental actions such as the CARES Act, will now result in an increase in the Company\u2019s delinquencies and net charge-off rate in 2020, as compared to the prior year. Similarly, we have experienced an increase to our allowance for credit losses and provision for credit losses during the three months ended March 31, 2020 attributable to the impact of COVID-19. To the extent the current environment continues beyond our expectations or deteriorates further, we may experience further increases to our allowance for credit losses and provision for credit losses related to COVID-19.  \n  \nI believe the CECL figure is the biggest threat to Synchrony\u2019s overall value. If conditions do not improve, I certainly expect its value to be adversely affected.    \n  \nI did not include my research pertinent to Amex and Capital One as I feel Synchrony is the most at risk. I do believe consumer lending is going to suffer tremendously, though. I did not link my 10K/Q excel, but if this gains traction, I will.  \n  \n**TL;DR: SYF $8P 9/18/20**", "created_utc": 1590199196.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gowmqr/the_case_against_synchrony_financial_syf/", "is_self": true}
