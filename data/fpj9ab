SPY 250 puts in February, BA puts, etc.\n\nNot many people have gold on their radar. It's an ETF that holds physical gold, except there are no audits and they refuse in principle to audit their subcustodians, which is bizarre. It would be easy to buy puts on GLD and hedge with actual gold you have in a safe or bank deposit box. When stimulus fails to cure people of corona and the thousands of deaths kick in and people get scared, they're going to try to cash in on their plan B, part of which is GLD. That's the time all that counter party risk could come into view and GLD could diverge strongly from actual gold. Heck, a real coin can diverge from the spot price, because when things go crazy, some actual gold is worth more than some theoretical gold.\n\ntldr buy coins and GLD monthly puts and wait for HSBC to get caught being corrupt (lol)", "created_utc": 1585255376.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpj9ab/gld_the_next_big_thing_to_fail_people_arent/", "is_self": true}
