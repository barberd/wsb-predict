{"id": "g6smx5", "title": "Intercept Pharma $ICPT", "selftext": "Hello fellow autists, let me interest you in my latest trade.\n\nIntercept Pharma has a new drug named Ocaliva awaiting FDA approval on June 9th. The drug is targeted to treat NASH (non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis). Which is basically a shitty liver disease with no symptoms until the later stages. The thing that makes Ocaliva special is that its the first drug to make it this far in the NASH market(aka there are no drugs available to treat NASH). Every other drug is still in trials.\n\nAs far as the efficacy and and safety goes, Ocaliva looks very well. Ocaliva has already been approved for different liver diseases (such as PBC) therefore the FDA already knows whats coming and what to expect. Sure, the drug has few symptoms like itching but most of the other major worries like cholesterol and liver toxicity has been cleared up by numerous reports done by the company or the FDA itself.\n\nWhat I find the most exciting part of this trade is that the market still has $ICPT near its Coronavirus lows. Prior to hell breaking loose, the acceptance of the new drug was already priced in because it was damn near a statistical certainty. Therefore the price of the stock was around 110 to 120. As of now $ICPT is at around $80. I expect this stock to climb forward as it nears the FDA meeting in June. LMK any questions you have or if you think this trade is flat out retarded\n\nTLDR: 6/19 90c, 6/19 95c, and the shares itself.", "created_utc": 1587668575.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6smx5/intercept_pharma_icpt/", "is_self": true}
