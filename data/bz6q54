Some of you may be wondering - whats next? I give to you DOMO as a potential target.\n\nA lot of people like to say that Domo is like Tableau, or Domo is like Looker. I say otherwise. I work in Analytics, and I can say that these other whole companies do only a fraction of what Domo does.\n\nIn order to have an effective data infrastructure, you need multiple components: Data ingestion, Data Aggregation, and Data Visualization. In each of these, there are multiple problems to solve. Whole companies, like Alteryx, only solve a small part of the puzzle. That particular company makes it easy to automate data ingestion from a variety of sources. Tableau really only solves visualizing the data - the data has to exist first, and at scale needs to be aggregated and stored.\n\nCompanies have entire engineering teams dedicated to each step of the way, and spend billions of dollars in engineering costs and software costs that only solve one small part of the overall puzzle. But Domo is different. They solve the whole thing end to end, eliminating entire departments. They can ingest, store, aggregate, and visualize the data, and can even go real time, something most fortune 500 companies cant figure out (so they keep hiring and keep trying to engineer it). \n\nRight now Domo's market cap is like 900m, which is like 4x revenue. It's insane how this stock has been overlooked, but I think it's because they haven't done a great job of explaining themselves. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised to see them buying Salesforce once people wake up to what they actually have.\n\nAs you may have guessed, I'm long DOMO.", "created_utc": 1560219519, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bz6q54/attn_millennials_turn_your_attention_from_bynd_to/", "is_self": true}
