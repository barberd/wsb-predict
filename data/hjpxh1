{"id": "hjpxh1", "title": "Schrodinger (SDGR) - DD Part 2", "selftext": "[Just over a month ago I wrote a DD for SDGR.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gn0rp9/schrodinger_sdgr_computational_drug_discovery/) In that post, I explained how SDGR owns the future of drug discovery R&D and is set to take off. It didn't get much traction, but I hope it helped out a few of you.\n\nThe stock was $66.48 on May 19th when I posted that DD. While most of the comments went on about waiting for a dip, I replied that I was buying more and more. The stock closed at $93.00 today. This DD will focus on updates since that first post, and why I believe it will continue to rise dramatically in the near term (in short: smart money appears to be pouring in).\n\nIf you have the time and interest, [this investor presentation from 23JUN2020](https://bmo.qumucloud.com/view/2020-healthcare-schrodinger#/) is great.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**UPDATES**\n\nSince last month's DD, there are two noteworthy announcements:\n\n1. *Schr\u00f6dinger Expands Discovery Efforts for COVID-19 Alliance with Advanced Molecular Simulation Leveraging High-Powered Parallel Computing on Google Cloud*\n\nWhile exciting, this isn't likely to yield direct profits for the company. In the announcement, the effort was called a \"philanthropic global initiative.\" Google donated the cloud credits for the research, so I assume Schrodinger's software is likely donated as well. But even if that is the case, there could be longer-term benefits to this method. SDGR offers cheaper academic licenses for their software. This business model is about establishing itself as *the* cheaper and faster alternative to traditional drug discovery efforts.\n\nEven if discounted or philanthropic licensing isn't the most profitable, it increases collaboration with individuals who are likely to remain in the industry. Similarly, in this announcement they name four well known pharma companies who are partnering with them for this effort. This can only benefit SDGR long term, as a company that adopts the software is likely to continue using and increasing their use. It is important to highlight that the software licenses are sold/priced in a manner that increases the price as more projects are being run simultaneously (so sales growth to an individual pharma company is likely as collaboration increases).\n\nOn a separate note, in the investor presentation I posted above, the CEO makes positive comments on the impact of COVID-19 on the software uptake. As lab resources are reduced, moving towards software based drug discovery is a natural transition.\n\n2. *Schr\u00f6dinger Announces Strategic Collaboration With Thermo Fisher Scientific to Expand Structure-Based Drug Discovery to Novel Targets Using Cryo-EM*\n\nThis is a perfect example of SDGR staying ahead of the curve on R&D. There is a great article on Cryo-EM, appropriately titled: \"[Revolutionary cryo-EM is taking over structural biology](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00341-9).\" In short, Cryo-EM is a new method for solving the structure of proteins which may not be easy to solve with traditional X-ray Crystallography. Even if the crystal structure was solved, there is the potential that the crystallization leads to conformational changes that aren't reflective of the protein structure in the body \\[oversimplified, but you get the point\\]. Cryo-EM avoids this.\n\nSolving the structure means you can use SDGR software to find a drug candidate for that protein target. Cryo-EM opens the world to new protein targets as well as proteins with crystal structures where prior drug discovery projects may have failed. Thermo Fisher is (unsurprisingly) a major player in the Cryo-EM space, perhaps the leader. Its hard to know the extent of this agreement and how big of a change it is to the top and bottom line (it is possible that Thermo was already a big customer, and they just now have a contractural agreement). At minimum it establishes them as the natural next step for drug discovery project using the newest structural biology methods. At best it could be positioning them for even more explosive growth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**WHY I BELIEVE THE GROWTH WILL CONTINUE**\n\nSDGR is always up. Seriously, look at the chart. Every other day is a 3-5+% gainer. There is only one explanation for this: the institutional money is pouring in. My hypothesis is that there is a bidding war between some big money groups, driving up the price dramatically. I suspect that they're each trying to gobble up shares before it becomes public that they've entered in to these positions (driving even more interest).\n\nA month ago, several people commented on my first DD that they thought it was a bit high in the $60s. I suspect people will comment on this that it is a bit high in the $90s, and in another month they'll say its a bit high in the $120s...\n\nCalls are expensive, but they are priced as high as they are because of the rapid growth. Depending on risk tolerance, it may be better to buy shares. I am \\~2/3 shares, \\~1/3 calls, by dollar value right now. I put my money where my mouth is, and bought in a bit more today.", "created_utc": 1593662393.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hjpxh1/schrodinger_sdgr_dd_part_2/", "is_self": true}
