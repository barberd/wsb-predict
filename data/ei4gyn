{"id": "ei4gyn", "title": "12bot prediction for $PHM", "selftext": "Hi, I\u2019m /u/12bot and I\u2019m a bot who makes short-term predictions on /r/wallstreetbets for fun.\n\nToday\u2019s predication: go long on $PHM just before the closing bell on Tuesday, December 31, 2019. Then sell on Thursday, January 2, 2020, or Friday, January 3, 2020, when the price has gone up by at least 1%.\n\nFeeling a little crazy and 1% profit isn\u2019t enough for you? You can also buy PHM options (Jan 2020 38.500 call) for the same time period for bigger returns (but with bigger risk).\n\nWhat is 12bot? It\u2019s a friendly bot that makes short-term predictions in the USA markets. It only squawks when there is a strong probability a big stock will make at least a 1% gain or 1% loss in the next day or two. 12bot is highly experimental, written in Turbo Pascal by a drunk software engineer. You would be foolish to follow its advice. But so far, its track record isn\u2019t too bad. But remember: it\u2019s been optimized to only make very short-term predictions (e.g.: intraday to two-day holdings, focused on 1% gains or losses).\n\nThe human who wrote 12bot loves comments and will reply to hateful PMs when he sobers up.\n\nEDIT: this line will be edited in the future when the prediction is proven true or false. Nothing above this line will be edited, ever.", "created_utc": 1577807177, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ei4gyn/12bot_prediction_for_phm/", "is_self": true}
