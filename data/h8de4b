So if you want to fit right in here at wsb, stop reading now. \n\nAnd honestly, rarely does someone get banned unless you don\u2019t drink your piss as you agreed to (well I think he actually drank it or at least faked it).\n\nThese markets are volatile right now. I would hate for people to lose money. These are the things I have learned while making tendies and of course, now I\u2019m in the hole. Your bf\u2019s hole. \n\nMainly, my motivation is because a few weeks ago someone posted that he enjoyed posting false information. I just think that was a shit thing to do. I have seen desperate people in here losing money they hoped would become enough to fix a problem. I have seen great stories where people were able to pay off debts. But I\u2019ve seen shit loads of porn loss. At the end of the day, I hope everyone does well. Our enemies aren\u2019t within this sub. Or at least, I think this way. \n\nOften I see people in the daily thread asking simple questions. Things maybe they should have known ahead of time. I always try to answer if I can. Especially, the \u201cI\u2019m out of day trades but I\u2019m profitable. Should I take the PDT ban?\u201d Sometimes, you can hear how desperate they are. At the end of the day, you are responsible for your choices, but still I\u2019m allowed to feel for my fellow man. \n\nI may get banned for this, because by trying to share knowledge with you dipshits, I may upset the old timers who enjoy hazing (in a fun way) you idiots that ask dumb questions. Actually, there are no dumb questions. I just want to help you learn as fast as possible. This market is a chance for people to acquire enough wealth to improve their lives. And I hope you are one of them. \n\n\nhttps://1drv.ms/b/s!Aqa-BjdZn8DFa9EGUqU1efc_7jE?e=i47vDb\n\nI want to thank those who read the draft and helped me out with suggestions.\n\nAnd fuck the guy who gave me gold, when I posted a few weeks ago that I felt like writing something to help people.
