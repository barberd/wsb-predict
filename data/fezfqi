In the 1960s, there was a full-fledged Eurodollar market operating entirely outside of the US banking system and therefore without US regulation.\n\nSo, what are Eurodollars? According to Milton Friedman, Eurodollar system creates new US dollar money supply out of thin air at the stroke of a bookkeeper\u2019s pen with no backing by gold or by physical cash issued by the US Treasury. Because all of this was happening outside of the US banking system, it was exempt from regulation that would have otherwise prevented it from occurring inside the US banking system.\n\nThe leverage ratio was mostly made on a 1:9 basis (100000 USD creates an additional 900000 USD to banks outside of the US) but not a single dollar was moved and remains as a interbank liability, which should means that the money still remains in the bank of the US, but banks outside of the US still has 9 times leverage thanks to US banks giving it US liquidity.\n\nAccording to Jeffrey Snider first PowerPoint (link of his podcasts and the PowerPoint could be found at the Res section) The origins of the US dollar shortage during the crisis are linked to the expansion since 2000 in banks\u2019 international balance sheets. The outstanding stock of banks\u2019 foreign claims grew from $10 trillion at the beginning of 2000 to $34 trillion by end-2007, a significant expansion even when scaled by global economic activity. The year-on-year growth in foreign claims approached 30% by mid-2007, up from around 10% in 2001.\n\nSo, the world was short on dollars due to over expansion and over lending which led to a shortage of USD/ a liquidity squeeze and the market collapsed fearing the lack of USD at least according to Jeffrey Snider.\n\nThe feds than step in and starts to print juicy USD to satisfy the masses known as QE.  The world was back to track and continues to lend out those Eurodollars like normal to outside of the US, until 2019.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRepo liquidity crisis in late 2019:\n\nWhile the feds have been pumping 100 Bn repo loans to banks in Mar 5 due to high liquidity shortage:\n\nNew York Fed had pumped $100 billion in 1-day repo loans into the trading houses on Wall Street, $8.6 billion short of what the trading houses had sought to borrow. Even at the peak of the repo loan crisis that began on September 17, 2019 and through the end of January 2020, the Fed had never pumped out $100 billion in 1-day repo loans on a single day. Yesterday, the Fed pumped out another $100 billion in 1-day repo loans against demand for $111 billion \u2013 further evidence that Wall Street firms are in need of liquidity.\n\nThe fed has been pumping smaller amounts of repo loans beginning during a crisis between Sep \u2013 Dec 2019, nobody knows what trigger it, but it just happens suddenly:\n\nIn the week of Sept. 16, a lot of cash flowed out of the repo pipes just as more securities were flowing in -- meaning that suddenly there wasn\u2019t enough cash for those who needed it. That mismatch drove overnight repo rates to 10% on Sept. 17, from about 2% the week before. And the feds begins to step in and provide liquidity to the masses again by the Not QE operation.\n\nSeptember 27: at least $75 billion in overnight repos, and at least $30 billion in 14-day repos\n\nSeptember 30 to October 10: at least $75 billion in overnight repos\n\nIn total more than $320 billion of total repo market support from the Fed since Sept. 17, when for the central bank began pumping in daily liquidity after overnight lending rates jumped to almost 10% from nearly 2%.\n\nPic of the total repo operation Sep-Dec 2019: [https://ei.marketwatch.com/Multimedia/2019/12/03/Photos/NS/MW-HW284\\_Bianco\\_20191203143402\\_NS.jpg?uuid=dc0fca12-1603-11ea-90a4-9c8e992d421e](https://ei.marketwatch.com/Multimedia/2019/12/03/Photos/NS/MW-HW284_Bianco_20191203143402_NS.jpg?uuid=dc0fca12-1603-11ea-90a4-9c8e992d421e)\n\nJPMorgan even secretly swapping dollars out for U.S. Treasury instruments, estimates could be high as $250 billion worth.\n\nBut nevertheless, a crisis that people outside of the financial circle never know about was safely avoided and while there could be a crisis in the future, 2019 is safe for now, the crisis may come one day but not that fast\u2026. Until the beer virus suddenly rams through the door.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe beer virus:\n\nIn an interconnected world where money, cargo and people travel across continents more frequent than ever. The beer virus has suddenly created the First Global Supply-Chain Crisis and causes an unprecedent demand and supply shock that no one knows what would happen.\n\nPicture of the economic impact of the beer virus to countries: [https://promarket.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CORONAVIRUS2.jpg](https://promarket.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CORONAVIRUS2.jpg)\n\nThe fed suddenly went into panic mode, the 2008 crisis was caused by many debts (including debts from real estate) and not being repaid, imagine what would happen on a global scale when everything suddenly comes to a halt?\n\nA 50-rate cut comes but the market still drops down, the banks are in extreme panic and there are massive bonds buying everyday but the buying was already started since Dec 2019. This shows that there might be some problems the big banks/feds may know about, but they seems to be hiding about it.\n\nRemember the Eurodollar that was being used by everyone and was leveraged around 9x ratio? Even if there is a small liquidity squeeze, a chain reaction would occur and bring the global financial system down. So, I would not surprise a 75 point rate comes, but the virus is causing a supply chain problem and it seems that the point cut is unlikely to save the market unless the Fed starts to QE again since the repo market is already facing liquidity problems again, with 116 Bn shortage on Mar 5 and the Fed is just pumping 100 Bn.\n\nSo keep an eye on the repo market, the more liqudity shortage is has the more possibly the banks would need to sell its assets for cash causing a further market decline (see Short intro about the repo market)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDeutsche bank the new Lehman Brothers?\n\nWhen most banks stock prices climbs up above or at least remains at around 2008 levels, Deutsche bank stock price in 2008 is 24.39 and now is just 7.59 with a market cap of only 15.86 Bn. Considering banks like BOA has a market cap around 220 Bn, the fourth largest bank in Europe  had total assets of 1.541 trillion dollars and total liabilities of 1.469 trillion dollars but with just a pathetic net income of 341 Mil in 2018 and only 15.86 Bn market capital should show you that there is high probability of it to go bust.\n\nBut the problem is Deutsche bank could be the new Lehman Brothers because it has 49 trillion dollars in exposure to derivatives, it puts Deutsche Bank in the same league as the bank holding companies of U.S. juggernauts JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, which logged in at $48 trillion, $47 trillion and $42 trillion, respectively, at the end of December 2018 according to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Furthermore, Deutsche Bank is heavily interconnected financially to JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America as well as other mega banks in Europe.\n\nThe negative interest rate have made banks in Europe unable to generate profits and some debt defaults like 2-4% rate would already send the bank to bankruptcy combine with a potential USD shortage and the beer virus spreading in Europe causing havoc, Deutsche bank could become the new Lehman brothers and with its high exposures to derivatives should ring some warning sounds to all of us.\n\nA graph of its connection with other banks: [https://wallstreetonparade.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Systemic-Risk-Among-Deutsche-Bank-and-Global-Systemically-Important-Banks.jpg](https://wallstreetonparade.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Systemic-Risk-Among-Deutsche-Bank-and-Global-Systemically-Important-Banks.jpg)\n\nConclusion:\n\nI would highly recommend to pay attention to recent news since there are so many factors that any of it could easily make the whole modern financial system collapse and also remember that we are also facing a supply chain event that there is no historical precedent.

I see that my post doesn't have any critical mistakes, but simply something went missing.\n\nSo there is the Libor market which is the largest middle man in the world and there is also a global swap network for central banks, currently it seems there are some problems with Libor too, anyway I think I don't want to read more about Libor and other stuff, since is sort of out of the subject? I can't find something about Libor and the liquidity shortage on USD\n\nThe point of the whole post is that there is already some cracks in the financial system in late 2019, if it wasn't for the beer virus people the liquidity crisis would mostly be forgotten and the market would be unlikely to drop for like 1-2 years . Since trump doesn't want the market to go bust .\n\nBut the beer virus suddenly happened and the Fed are printing those juicy USD again+ we are all in crisis mode, so the post just focus on repo since the subject focusing here was the potential future and the history about USD liquidity shortage.\n\nAfter all, only the US Fed could print USD and other banks can't make USD out of thin air especially if you already leverage 9x from your original USD.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-04/libor-plunges-most-since-2008-as-rate-catches-up-to-fed-cut-bets](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-04/libor-plunges-most-since-2008-as-rate-catches-up-to-fed-cut-bets)\n\n[https://www.cfr.org/article/central-bank-currency-swaps-tracker#!/#intro](https://www.cfr.org/article/central-bank-currency-swaps-tracker#!/#intro)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2: If you see the chart, Deutsche bank has most exposure to Chinese banks,HSBC and BOA. As a person in HK I would not recommend you to short HSBC since there are so many elderly in here buy HSBC like a cult.\n\nSo short BOA,JP morgan, Citi and wells fargo? \n\nRead more about Deutsche bank here : [https://wallstreetonparade.com/2020/03/two-charts-explain-why-wall-street-banks-are-under-so-much-selling-pressure/](https://wallstreetonparade.com/2020/03/two-charts-explain-why-wall-street-banks-are-under-so-much-selling-pressure/) \n\nEdit 3:So someone asked me the music here it is [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vb-bH\\_W1BfY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vb-bH_W1BfY) , be warned is weeb music", "created_utc": 1583606761.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fezfqi/the_ultimate_collapse_of_the_modern_financial/", "is_self": true}
