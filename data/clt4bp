Let's do this.\n\nToday we're looking at the company Digital Turbine (APPS).\n\nHow they looking the last week? Up 8.1%\n\nHow they looking the three months? Up 42.5%\n\nHow about the last year? Up 281.28%\n\nThis company is a juggernaut and I love their vision.\n\nYou must think to yourself, \u201dBut wait, sure the price must be too high for me to buy now?\" \n\nNope. The current price sits at $5.64. But let\u2019s examine some options.\n\nIf we load up on the $5 strike price for 8/16 ($0.68), I\u2019m anticipating a +10% move after earnings and this should get you around 50% profit for every dollar you spend.\n\nPersonally, I like the 9/20 expiration at the $5 strike. It\u2019s only $0.88 with better liquidity and better bid/ask.\n\nThe profitability will be less on a big jump following earnings but it will also give this time to run a little. And, in the off chance the the stock price dips or remains flat, you will have plenty of time to hold and watch it gain traction.\n\nWhat do they do?\n\n\u201cToday's app discovery ecosystem is broken. Digital Turbine's mobile delivery platform makes it easier than ever for people to discover new apps, for operators and OEMs to build new revenue streams, and for advertisers to reach users at scale.\u201d\n\nThis is the truth. When\u2019s the last time you went into the app store and found a cool game or other app? Almost all the cool apps I\u2019ve found are through word of mouth or through some other round about way.\n\nThis company is a 2-way street. There\u2019s millions of consumers out there looking for cool new applications for their phone. There\u2019s so many new companies looking to get their apps into the hands of their target audience and this company is here to bridge a much needed gap.\n\nThis company boasts 1,579,307,295 Sponsored app installs on over 160 million devices.\n\nIs this a sure fire bet? Just as sure as I was diagnosed with Aspergers. I\u2019m a tip-toe walking, obsessive, socially unaware, dude unable to detect irony.\n\nLets get this bread, gang", "created_utc": 1564898864, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/clt4bp/monday_earnings_play_bring_money/", "is_self": true}
