I was thinking why do most people that make a lot of money lose it soon after? 2 weeks ago I turned $400 into $13k with BA calls and lost it all the following week. \n\nHow to make money- wait for an opportunity to buy fds rather than buying random fds and hoping that it will go your way. For example, based on the recent news I realized that Boeing will moon in the very short term. So I brought a bunch of fds On Boeing and made a lot of money.\n\nHow to not lose money- when people make a lot of money they have the tendency to make more money.  This tendency is the reason people lose it all. You DONT have to trade every single day. When you make a lot of money, wait for opportunities to buy fds instead of buying Fds every single day. Right after I sold my BA calls I went all in on Baba puts and lost 40% of my money. The day I sold my puts I bought bunch of spy puts 5 min later. And lost close 80% of the remaining money. The next day I bought bunch of FB Fds and lost all of the remaining money.\n\n( I am not a pro trader and this is what I learned trading options for the past 6 months)", "created_utc": 1567310588, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cy5f69/how_to_make_money_and_not_lose_it_only_for_people/", "is_self": true}
