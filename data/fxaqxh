Your savior VIX is bleeding out and Theta gang right now is circling your dying corpes\n\nYou all need FEAR in order to even get a CHANCE on your OTM SPY puts.  And Im talking about EXTREME fear to get those stupid March 18 selloff numbers but lets take a look on how this all happened\n\nCoronavirus - February... shit started and escalated to beginning of march.  We went from USA #1 to holy fuck everything is shut down and we all are DEAD in two weeks.  this kinda shock is gonna shoot up FEAR to ungodly levels.  Fear of the unknown, on deaths, on how long things will be shut down, on the curve blah blah.\n\nThen comes acceptance by the end of March.  We have accepted that we will have a lot of people dying and a lot of unemployed motherfuckers and that businesses are completely shut down.  It aint fear when we hear all that bad news shit, its just like hearing your mom with stage 4 cancer just died.  You already know that shit was gonna happen - that fear is gone and you are in acceptance\n\nAnd then comes April - Hope.  Jpow and Trump got the brrrrr going at max speeds.  Faudi now saying curve flattening... and you all wonder why its going up??  Fear is going down being replaced by Hope\n\nLets break down the gay bear argument points -\n\n1) UnEmPloyMent! - no shit its gonna be in the millions when a company is completely shut down.  But a ton of these fuckers are FURLOUGHED as well.   Hearing crazy high unemployment does NOT boost fear, it just confirms companies are shut down completely\n\n2) DeFaUlTs - Duh of course people are going to default if everythings shut down.  This doesnt change shit.  This is like saying water is wet.  The problem you all missing out on is that unlike in 2008, lenders are figuring out workarounds to push out the time and not force mass bankruptcies.  The main reason they have this ability is because of the brrrrrrr.  We had no cash left in 2008 but we have a fucking printing press in 2020.\n\n3) DeaThs!! - People are gonna die.  Its expected, there is no FEAR of the unknown anymore.  Everyone is not saying its a FLU anymore and getting surprised with mega deaths.  In fact, 1K death a day is like a normal day, that isn't going to increase any fear.  Cases are going to shoot up and that is meaningless because of how the virus goes undetected.  So unless the virus mutates into a 1 day killer for all age groups, the fear here is gone and its now just containment mode.\n\n4) EarNings!! - See point 1.  See point 2.  People are expecting god awful earnings and pulled guidance.  You thing its a fucking surprise now? the real surprise would be a company meeting expectations.  And that leads to the last point\n\n...shorting the SPY - this is the stupidest fucking thing you can do.  AMZN, MSFT, WMT, COST tons of big dicks are in there thriving in this environment.  They will all fucking kill expectations this ER season.  Spy wont even have a chance to go down if those big digs are supporting everyone up. You all fucked up shorting SPY and not shorting individual stocks\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsoo TLDR.  Bears are fucked.  Either market goes up or stays flat / small dips and theta kills your puts.
