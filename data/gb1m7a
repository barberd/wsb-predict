Screwed me well.\n\nCost basis - 50\\* 1000 = $50,000\n\nCurrent value - 50\\* 100 = $5000\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPosition - TSLA 850 C - May 1st - Purchased at $10 each.\n\nIf Elon can send in a rebuttal tweet it would be great.... Elong where are you my GOD of the day?\n\nAny ideas ?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uur1lk4f30w41.png?width=1816&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6705b367dc3454f09a901a857c1aea12ceb4f8c", "created_utc": 1588272330.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gb1m7a/tsla_loss_porn_post_earnings_purchase_90/", "is_self": true}
