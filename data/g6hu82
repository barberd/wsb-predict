Of course, this was done to let in some more of the quality DDs and enjoyable shitposts that kept getting rejected.   However, this was all done with an implied promise (see: Daily Discussion 4/20 or so) that *we as a community would spend some more time VOTING* on the new submissions that come through.\n \n \nJust like in real life (remember that thing?),  it does no good to complain about the quality of what we're getting if we don't use our own power to VOTE.  Mods asked us to spend more time in the \"New\" tab and sort out the wheat from the shit.  Let's please take some time to tell the actual retards still submitting \"DD\" on oil tankers to kindly Fuck Off.\n\n\n\n*  **TLDR: spend more time voting on posts in the \"New\" tab because the Mods said so.**\n\n\nedit: holy shit how do you format on here", "created_utc": 1587624242.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6hu82/the_democratization_of_wsb_is_failing_heres_how/", "is_self": true}
