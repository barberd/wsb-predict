I'll then wait for the tech market to bottom out (rip bulls lmao xddd) \n\nOnce everything is low I'll buy back an equal equity in NVDA, AMD, and TSM. Why these stock you ask? 3 reasons.\n\n- It will help to diversify my one company portfolio\n\n- All three of these companies simply do not have any competition, in the short term at least, 6-8 months.\n\n- I have a surface level knowledge about the tech industry, that makes me feel I'm educated enough to risk what little money I have investing.\n\nThank you Robin hood for letting me invest before I can drive to my job on my own!", "created_utc": 1566614336, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cunu2p/my_plays_for_the_week_of_august_26th/", "is_self": true}
