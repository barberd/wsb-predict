Dropped it into NCHL shares at a nice cool low of $15.  Watched it skyrocket to damn near $30, and my diamond hands held strong... till it tanked.  So I sold off my shares at around $21.  Goddamn diamond hands got me again.\n\nMeanwhile, I\u2019m an idiot.  After I sold my shares, i thought I hadn\u2019t sold my shares.  So I shorted 4800 shares at a stupid number on accident.  And I went back to work...\n\nThe fuckin dust settles after hours and I look at my positions and I\u2019m holding a fuck ton of shorts  because I have idiot monkey hands.  I\u2019m holding tens of thousands in shorts.  I shit a brick.  Buy to cover.  And I\u2019m up $2,600.  \n\nAnyhow.  Fuck me.  Sometimes retards win.\n\nEdit: NCLH", "created_utc": 1591841095.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h0puhe/serious_monkeyhand_wins_today/", "is_self": true}
