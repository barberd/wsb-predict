I've made a very small profit just swing trading cheap stocks and bitcoin from time to time on Robinhood. Now I want to play with the big boys and I'm ready to blow up my whole account with options. I was thinking about buying MSFT calls since earnings are coming out tomorrow, although I have done zero research and have no idea if this is a good idea or not. What do you guys think?? MSFT calls good idea or am I fucking retarded? \n\nAlso, if anybody can point me to where I can learn more about trading in general, some of the research and strats I should be using to mitigate risk, that would be cool too. And please don't tell me to invest in index funds or open a 2% ally savings account, I want to see gains like bitcoin in 2017.", "created_utc": 1563468569, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ceuzr3/i_have_no_idea_what_im_doing_crucify_me/", "is_self": true}
