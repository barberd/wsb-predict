We\u2019re gonna be swimming in the trendies and fat booty Becky bitches. I base this whole play on the inevitable death March of bald Sith Lord Bezos. Instead of betting on Amazon to do well, we bet on all their competitors to go out of business. Literally can\u2019t go TITS UP! \n\n$JCP is a wounded deer limping through the woods just waiting for some cameo bro to send a 5.56 thru it\u2019s fucking skull. Holiday revenue is being reported as down, the retail-polcalypse is upon us, and e-commerce is grinding brick and mortar to make its bread. \n\nLiterally haven\u2019t been inside a JCP in a decade, the population of BOOMERS going in there to spend $200 for a comforter set and $50 toaster are dying left and right. It\u2019s the time to rise up and light this mummified corpse on fire!", "created_utc": 1577106451, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eekedg/22120_jcp_1_puts/", "is_self": true}
