What i'm curious to know is how would i go about calculating the probable levels UGAZ will be at this year for the peak of nat gas demand so i can have a reasonable expectation of payoff in this trade. I'm afraid UGAZ will reverse split, and it seems like these reverse splits are arbitrarily decided by the issuing banks at any time.. which is gay.", "created_utc": 1563735074, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cg2j4v/calling_smarter_ones_calculating_buying_power_of/", "is_self": true}
