I was checking out my options on Robinhood for XOP.  XOP is down almost 5% so I thought I'd be making some money on my $15 put strike.\n\nI go in to check and the put option prices are sitting at .56 for March 6.  Didn't look right so I look on TD Ameritrade and they were showing as .70/.72.\n\nI'm not sure if you sold what price they would settle on, but hope for some good fills, I guess.  Or verify your option prices elsewhere if they look out of place.", "created_utc": 1583262899, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fczq5v/dont_trust_the_option_chain_prices_on_robinhood/", "is_self": true}
