{"id": "cqih7t", "title": "DD: Buy GO calls", "selftext": "So GO closes at 37.59 yesterday, has a great AH earnings report for its very first one since IPO and goes up 12%, everyone everywhere fluffing them up as a great long term buy. Now it's somehow down to 38 after hours today after a market dip of 3%. Unless an IPOs first earnings report smashing expectations has somehow been priced in for a month, which makes no fucking sense, this feels way underpriced for now.\n\nThey don't buy shit from China so they don't have to worry about Trump tweets. And yes, retail is hurting, but it's hurting because people can buy the same shit for the same price or less online without leaving home, and they can't do that with stores like GO - not only because they're grocery and buying groceries on a place like Amazon is like shitting your wallet down a toilet, but they are far cheaper than any other options and will stay that way. People love getting deals and stretching their dollar, or perhaps put another way, they don't like the thought of pissing money away if they can avoid it by overpaying for shit, and the earnings report proved all that. When I had discovered this place when a new location popped up near me, a few years back, the first time in there I couldn't not look at every single thing in the store awestruck on the pricing. They had 5 lb blocks of white cheddar Velveeta for $8 when 1 lb is like $7-$8 at other places. CHEESE George, CHEEE^(EEESE!)\n\nMacy's on the other hand blows, as their ER proved, because they're trying to sell you $50 shit for $100-$200 when you can easily find it for $50 online. Perhaps great when the wealthy made up 1%, but now it's like 0.1% and the rest of people aren't havin' it. Oh right, you can go to their closeouts and look through racks of random shit for 2 hours and hope to find that $50 online item there for $49.95, I forgot. Plus people in general are shying away from department stores because they could just shop online and have an extra hour of not aimlessly walking around a department store to do things like absolutely nothing with. That's partly why JC's Pennies.\n\nSo GO calls make sense to me. I did this shit with OLLI just yesterday for the same sort of reason after it inexplicably went down 5% the day before, and sold at 49% profit on a pretty modest play (the YOLO play would've been 82.50 calls for 350%+ gain).\n\nMaybe not buy calls for 8/16 unless you feel extra YOLOrific because who tf knows what crazy shit is happening tomorrow and Friday, but 8/23 or further out to give time for investors to get a clue.\n\nDisclaimer: The aforementioned OLLI trade was my first ever, 2nd ever was an APPL put mid-day today expecting the China tariff news yesterday would wash away today on a down market, got away from it with a 3% gain after that didn't happen, and this marks #3 and a strangle on SPY for next Weds as #4 giving this ridic volatility, so we'll see. I am on the spectrum and have had success investing in other areas, and have observed this place and options for about a year before diving into it. I'm basically Warren Buffett.", "created_utc": 1565828971, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cqih7t/dd_buy_go_calls/", "is_self": true}
