Olczak believes that this device also has the scientific capability to one day move Philip Morris past nicotine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s beyond combustion, beyond tobacco, and beyond nicotine,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen the FOX Business host asked how long it would take to completely switch away from combustibles, Olczak replied, \u201cI wish we will achieve it before I retire. So I still have a few years to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow that we're gearing up where I\u2019m located most of the resources there are a full alignment of all our employees our board staffing. We have a right wing into our sales to achieve something that, you know, 15 or so years ago would be would be just a dream,\u201d he explained.\n\n\nWhy aren\u2019t you shorting Big Tobacco?", "created_utc": 1558616894, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bs2qmd/philip_morris_going_totally_smokeless_looks_to/", "is_self": true}
