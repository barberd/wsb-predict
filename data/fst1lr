You're not even on the level of a degenerate gambler who takes out a loan on his house to keep gambling, because at least that poor guy doesn't delude himself into believing that there's even the possibility that he can predict what cards will be dealt.\n\nBut you? You retards astound me. Some of you actually believe you AREN'T just betting on a coin flip. This sub is the blind leading the blind on steroids.\n\nThe point of the corona virus scare is to give the government power to quarantine you and lock down cities at a whim. Japan, particularly TOKYO, the densest city in the world, has had corona virus for 4 months now with no quarantines or lockdowns or \"muh work from home\" and they only have 54 deaths. This is part of a larger \"agenda\" for world governments to control the world. Is this nefarious? Maybe. Is it illuminati level stuff? Perhaps. Or maybe it's just necessary action to take in a world where the population will hit 10-15 billion within 30 years. Perhaps this is all necessary, perhaps not.\n\nFor the people to accept quarantine, they're going to need to be hit hard, but not so hard that there's rioting and looting and murder. This quarantine has already turned most people's lives upside down. Mass unemployment and a complete shift in quality of life seemingly overnight. People are hurting at it's starting to show, and they cannot take much more of this bullshit,.\n\nSo, that's enough then, that's going to be all the pain that is coming. Low IQ people, which is most people as well as you guys, have already accepted quarantine with open arms. \"Please save us big government! We know you would NEVER lie to us to hide a blatant and unconstitutional erosion of our freedoms!\".\n\nThey've got what they wanted already. Quarantine is HERE TO STAY and it is FOREVER going forward. You lost they won. If they were to really crash the market now with Fed manipulation, people might actually start a revolution... No need for that, because as I said they've already GOTTEN what they want.\n\nSo buy calls. The stock market is going to moon harder than ever over the next couple of months, because it'll \"prove\" how effective quarantine was and that if we all \"work together\" by giving up our rights, we can overcome anything and all our monies will be A-OKAY if we trust Mr. Government!!", "created_utc": 1585717077.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fst1lr/why_youre_all_dumb_and_gay_and_what_to_do_next/", "is_self": true}
