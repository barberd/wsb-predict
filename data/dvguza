Now it shot up over 35 pts past 3 days, including 21 pts yesterday.   I think pretty good gamble put bets for 11/15 weekly.   Looking for 10-12 pts quick drop this week.   What you guys think??", "created_utc": 1573594575, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dvguza/ttd_after_earnings_late_run_up_and_pumping_going/", "is_self": true}
