{"id": "fo6wxx", "title": "The case for RGR, the bear market TSLA?", "selftext": "This is one of the most anecdotal trades ever, but also possibly the best positioned stock for the foreseeable climate, and I stumbled upon in just by chance. It's still under the radar, but won't be for very long.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI went Friday to look at a gun, a model I've been putting off for a rainy day. Well, as soon as I got to Academy, I saw the counter was packed. A lot of their inventory was gone, and almost all the ammo.  They said orders were being delayed by two weeks. So I went to two local gun shops a couple miles away.  Both packed. The energy in these places were palpable.  You could tell the owners & employees were swamped. They kept saying this was the craziest they've ever seen it, in different ways, every place I went.  So I perused 5 local shops total, and 3 big retailers between Friday and Saturday: Academy, Sportsman W-house, Bass Pro.  I finally got the one I was looking for, but half the reason I kept looking was to see if everywhere was the same thing.  Biggest surprise.. ammo.  Every single place was low on ammo. Most ar rifles were gone, saw a lot of people buying pistols. But I kid you not, every single one of the EIGHT places had the same exhausted story from the guys behind the glass. Academy and Bass both said they were giving two-week timeframes for backorder. And a story I heard in one of the local shops, a guy said he just got back from TX where the stores were being bought up, but didn't think it would be like that here. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nOf course I was thinking of RGR stock, as they're really the only pure play right now on just firearms.\n\nSo I got home and started looking for stories across the country, in local stations about gun stores.. and found these, among others:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nhttps://dailygazette.com/article/2020/03/21/local-gun-sales-soar-as-virus-fears-mount\n\nhttps://www.thelondoneconomic.com/news/world-news/in-pics-americans-are-panic-buying-guns/16/03/    <-----Twitter Posts From Everywhere\n\nhttps://indyeastend.com/news-opinion/covid-19/covid-19-spikes-gun-sales/\n\nhttps://www.enterprisenews.com/news/20200322/middleboro-lakeville-stores-gun-ammo-sales-soar-amid-coronavirus-crisis\n\nhttps://www.texarkanagazette.com/news/local/story/2020/mar/23/outbreak-drives-increased-firearm-ammo-sales/821741/\n\nhttps://44news.wevv.com/nationwide-run-guns-amid-coronavirus-stock/\n\nhttps://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2020/03/18/purchases-firearms-ammo-surge-amid-covid-19-fears/2865796001/\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**ALSO**, the online sports retailers and online independent gunshops are showing sold out of almost all their inventory, especially rifles. Along with 'delay' banners \nacross most of their sites.\n \n\nAnd this:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/fXUbo3Q\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/JkHTM4u\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nIt's real, it's national and it's perhaps the biggest buying trend outside of toilet paper, only no one realizes it's happening yet. And the trend is going to have serious lasting power. Ruger is not only good quality for a decent price, but it's one of the most popular guns for first time buyers. Perfect for this specific environment, new buyers and people who just want stuff that works. They have the best capacity for ramping up production, compared to other smaller manufacturers. If stores need to order, they know they can order Ruger. It's also the only pureplay. S&W got acquired by AOBC, and there are no other liquid instruments to express with, adding to the possible bottleneck of speculators into RGR. Very importantly, Ruger has no debt. They are well equity capitalized. They fit the perfect profile for a stock that can withstand a shock in which more indebted companies are having trouble right now. They're one of the only and perhaps from what I've seen with my own eyes, the most.. positively exposed product company for experiencing a windfall in revenue right now, and for the foreseeable months ahead.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nHere's why the trade structure makes sense. They just reported earnings Feb 19th, but that covered the period 9/31-12/31, and the report was lackluster so the stock didn't get to an elevated level already.  All the gun sales started to ramp up early January, and then into February, before going completely bonkers in March, which ends in 7 days. Not only is this quarter going to be a blowout, but the guidance going for Q2 is going to be extremely elevated and in-turn, the 2020 yearly outlook as well. Try finding that kind of concentrated sales growth with already established gross and net margins on a non-debt balance sheet anywhere in the market right now. Nearly impossible.  Most those other thematic trades don't have this kind of real world, concentrated healthy outlook, and actually make profit doing so.  So the next earnings report is 5/20, and the earliest expiry that encapsulates it is 17_Jul, and the next contract after that, 16_Oct, encapsulates two earnings reports. So without going into all the details of why this trade makes the most sense to me for a safe, longer-term, higher amount trade, but still with a nice return, the trade is: \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSelling 17jul 50p/35p credit vertical spread @ Cr +6.30\n\nusing proceeds to buy:\n\n16oct 50c     @ -5.80\n\n17apr 52.5c     @ -0.75  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe only question is timing entry of this trade. With limit daily moves in the indexes, I'd rather enter on a large down day.  But it is possible that on a down market, it strongly outperforms, as it did yesterday.  Another thing to keep in mind, it's not a component of the S&P index, giving it more freedom to vary from SPY. \n\n&nbsp;", "created_utc": 1585063507.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fo6wxx/the_case_for_rgr_the_bear_market_tsla/", "is_self": true}
