{"id": "dlvnlf", "title": "Buy SPY puts Wednesday", "selftext": "No economic data coming out Wednesday so algos will drive things up. But Thursday a bunch of data points will be posted, they'll probably be in line with the last set of data points that came out and SPY will drop. Some good earnings now, especially the bank sector, has allowed us to test ATH again but US consumer strength is the main thing holding our markets up. Friday 10am the consumer sentiment index will be posted. If that number is weak along with Thursday's data then we'll have the Friday that bears have been dreaming of for months now and we could kiss goodbye to SPY 300 for a long time.
