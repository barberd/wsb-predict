{"id": "fooq85", "title": "I just realized a hilarious blunder I made while stoned yesterday", "selftext": "So I\u2019m new to this whole options thing right. Ive always had money in regular stonks, but they were too boring for me so for kicks I\u2019m a degenerate sports gambler. (Idk that I\u2019ll ever go back to sports betting after learning about how much more money is on the table here,,, unless I run out of money first lolol) I\u2019ve been a member of this sub for about a year now because y\u2019all are the funniest people on the internet (no cap). However most of the technical shit y\u2019all said I had no clue about, I just would swing by this sub on occasion for some Lolz\n\nAnyway so they canceled sports for this stupid fucking beer flu right? And I\u2019m like FUCK, I need some money on something A$AP. So I start learning what the fuck all this shit y\u2019all are talking about is. \n\nAlso \nSIDEBAR FOR ANNOYING ADVICE SEEKERS:\nI\u2019ve been learning through google, not being a fucking annoying little bitch in here asking \u201cwhat should I do\u201d every two seconds because fuck being that guy. ITS NOT THAT HARD. Fucking seriously. Some of y\u2019all are asking questions that take 2 fucking seconds to google. I\u2019m glad this sub bans that shit. Even people new to this like me know some of the shit y\u2019all are saying is retarted (not the good kind) \n\nSo like I said I\u2019ve always tossed some money around in stocks so I figured I had a pretty good handle on this thing. Those Greek fucks were a little confusing at first but I thought I was starting to put the pieces together. \n\nAfter a bunch of initial L\u2019s, mostly Uber and Lyft Puts, I decided to take a slightly updated approach.\n\nI took $GME 4/17 3.50p \n\nLonger term than I had been doing (weeklies), not as aggressive as I had been going for in terms of price change of the underlying stock. And a company that is surely going to get outpaced by the competition and kicked in the dick by beer flu...... right!?!?!?  \n\nSo first this mother fucking stock has been everywhere under the sun these past few days. Which is throwing me the fuck off already, what\u2019s this things deal? \n\nBut then on top of that I got high..... \n\nI was planning to hangout, kickback, maybe drive my girlfriend and her boyfriend to the movies or something, not worry about my options.... but then I saw it.... I saw someone talking about a GME short squeeze... a fucking what now? I yelled as I typed into google. Is GME about to lay a bunt down the 3rd base line?\n\nAnyway, scared shitless I began to look into hedging, minimizing risk, paranoid off my ass, I\u2019m pretty sure I blacked out. \n\nAnd so this morning, not really remembering the full extinct of yesterday\u2019s stoned panicked frenzy. I check my acct and realized I\u2019m also stuck with....  \n$GME 7/15 $7c \n\nIn conclusion \nNot looking for sympathy or advice; this money is just profits from sports gambling I put towards this because I need to gamble on SOMETHING right now.  Not even quite sure yet if I may have stumbled into a good position or not; or what the fuck this short squeeze actually means, besides maybe bigly green for GME on Thursday. I\u2019ve still gotta hit the ol google machine after I finish typing this. \n\nFeel free to roast me, as this post is essentially chum in the waters. But this is just a skill I\u2019m trying to learn with some money that won\u2019t kill me if I lose rn so I figure I\u2019d share my dumbass move here. felt the need to tell y\u2019all about this time I went full retard, and to remind you all to never go full retard. \n\nI would post position but I really don\u2019t think anyone cares about my few hundred dollars in GameStop options, this story is far more for the lulz. Hope you enjoyed. And also  let\u2019s hope some sort of weird matrix happens where both positions hit. Thanks for coming to my ted talk.\n\nTL;DR \nNew at options, got high, went full retard.\nGME 4/17 3.50p \nGME 7/15 7c", "created_utc": 1585135734.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fooq85/i_just_realized_a_hilarious_blunder_i_made_while/", "is_self": true}
