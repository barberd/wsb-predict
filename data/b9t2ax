{"id": "b9t2ax", "title": "SOL earnings on Monday", "selftext": "ReneSola seems to have been at the bottom of the barrel for the past couple years, flying undervalued and under the radar while having a pretty good past 18 months behind the scenes. I'm guessing their earnings tomorrow \\*can't\\* be worse than their price already is - it's like there is no sentiment on the company because nobody is paying attention to the company, institutions have pulled money out with no real reasoning except that they had no strong reasoning to keep it in, and from this position, I'd bet \\*any\\* news is good news. Not confident enough to guarantee anything so don't consider my opinion advice, know that my goal here isn't to guide your decisions. I'm just trying to put eyes on a company that seems underlooked, not trying to get you to use my eyes in place of your own.", "created_utc": 1554480416, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b9t2ax/sol_earnings_on_monday/", "is_self": true}
