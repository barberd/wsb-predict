Last time Trump tweeted about the economy being at ATH was when China said that tariffs were rolling back and progress was being made on trade, even though mango man later said he did not agree to that (recession happened?? No).\nThis morning (same morning of his speech at the Economic Club of New York) he tweeted \u201cEconomy is BOOMING. Seems set to have yet another record day\u201d. Do you really believe he will fuck everything up and say something bad about the trade deal? Are you really waiting for that? Instead of following the trend and earning you are just waiting for some wrong comment about the trade deal from Trump?\nJust follow the uptrend and if he says something fucked up, change your position and follow the downtrend!!\nCure your autism with some reason. \ud83d\udc3b jesus was never real.", "created_utc": 1573565919, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dva399/how_are_bears_real/", "is_self": true}
