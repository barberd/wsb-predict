If you are playing these 3x ETF's right now, you're a fucking retard. These fucking things aren't backed by anything and are ready to go bankrupt.\n\nThey are slowly unwinding them to ZERO as you can clearly see.\n\n***STAY AWAY!***\n\n***Edit:*** The exact same situation today with many others including 'twins' of the regular gold miners\n\nNUGT, Gold Miners 3x Bull: -15%\n\nDUST, Gold Miners 3x Bear: -10%\n\nThese things are FUCKED\n\n***Edit 2:*** If you want to play the Gold Miners, use GDX instead. I know it's not as flashy, but the ETF is solid , extremely liquid, and options spreads are very reasonable (meaning you will be able to find a buyer when you actually want to)\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1584653182.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fli6i4/warning_to_3x_etf_shareholders_and_options/", "is_self": true}
