{"id": "gm9ies", "title": "Why $STNG Isn't A Meme And Will Actually Bring In Your 10 Banger", "selftext": "# Intro\n\nI am sure most of us are already aware but rates for storing crude oil on tankeres recently skyrocketed from their $25,000 a day average rate in 2019 to securing some vessels at $250,000 a day for VLCC (Very Large Crude Carrier).\n\nAfter the fall out of negative oil, storage rates for tankers has soared over 200% and companies are making substantial amounts of money while currently trading below their NAV (Net Asset Value). This creates an opportunity in purchasing shares of highly undervalued tanker companies such as Scorpio Tankers (STNG) to potentially see over 100% returns within the next year.\n\n# Oil Glut Overview\n\nThere are many speculators who look to invest in commodities without having to take physical ownership of whatever they are trading, so they look to the futures market. When trading futures, investors have to understand that it is a binding contract between the buyer and seller legally binding the buyer to take physical possession of 1,000 barrels of oil by expiration date per contract. Normally, you can just sell to another buyer before expiration date so you don\u2019t have to take physical possession. The issue arose when there were no more buyers and there were only speculators left holding oil contracts, forcing them to get rid of the contracts no matter the cost, hence negative oil.\n\n# Tanker Rates:\n\nIn an [interview with Robert Bugbee](https://www.tradewindsnews.com/tankers/tanker-rates-one-spot-voyage-makes-the-whole-year-in-red-hot-market/2-1-801368), President of Scorpio Tankers,\n\n>If an MR can get $30,000 per day on a spot voyage, it covers its costs for a year\u2026 If an LR2 gets $150,000 or $160,000 per day, it\u2019s the same\u2026 you could lay the ship up, earn zero for the next ten months, and still make a profit on the ship.

Of course these rates are cyclical and will not hold, that being said even if rates went to $0 by mid summer, the rates for Q2 have been so high that it'd still be one of their highest revenue years in their recent history.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Source: Scorpio Tankers ](https://preview.redd.it/rv3se9222lz41.png?width=1268&format=png&auto=webp&s=c305c367dcd42265132bb34a4b627b06db45016b)\n\nUnfortunately, rates are already coming down to about $55,000 for an LR2 but we have to keep in mind that 2019 YTD average was $14,000, we are still making over 300% more than 2019. To put this into perspective, Scorpio estimated if TCE rates can maintain over $40,000 then each share would be producing about $37 when $STNG is currently trading at $16.86.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Source: Scorpio Tankers](https://preview.redd.it/7cpga2c32lz41.png?width=529&format=png&auto=webp&s=babb1a7bf9c4af8ff7e7d057c5fffcfd537d53d3)\n\n# Scorpio Tankers:\n\nIt is very important to point out that Scorpio is in the business of the product market (AKA Refined or clean).\n\n[ Source: Scorpio Tankers](https://preview.redd.it/28j2oih42lz41.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=f065d59d537914e08607798e039e138899c7c28a)\n\nThey currently possess not only the largest fleet in the industry but also the largest clean tanker fleet which will become very important in the coming years.\n\n[ Source: Scorpio Tankers](https://preview.redd.it/vmria5s52lz41.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=ceb6c51491047dbd9499c90a44b5596022d25b3a)\n\nScorpio Tankers currently command the biggest, most competitive, and youngest fleet in the whole market and on top of all of that, their fleet is one of the largest scrubber invested fleets. The scrubbers allow for a significant cash flow benefit driven by the fuel savings given the current MGO-HSFO price spread.\n\nAs their non scrubber competitors are forced to switch their fuel to the more expensive VLSFO, STNG can continue to burn the less expensive HSFO and can see an annual cash flow benefit of over $100 million dollars.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Source: Scorpio Tankers](https://preview.redd.it/gumqof972lz41.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ca7bb611f12750382353bef1a7d5719c799ee13)\n\nNow that you have an understanding of Scorpio's fleet, lets take a look back at the fleet chart. If you take a quick look at the chart we can see the crude market is very crowded while the product market only has a handful of competitors. The key aspect the market is missing here is basic supply and demand, the demand for refined products and exports have been growing while the supply of tankers exporting refined products is decreasing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Source: Scorpio Tankers](https://preview.redd.it/pubsuwn82lz41.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=19ce71d5176b105c68c5bb1467e85b0f8a473cf6)\n\nNot only is demand growing but so is production, specifically Saudi Arabian production. Saudi Arabia was known for exporting exclusively crude oil and ironically had to import it's refined products until their recent refinery developments. Their production has been ramping up tremendously and have been seeing exports grow every year since 2013.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Source: Scorpio Tankers](https://preview.redd.it/aeu5nim92lz41.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=eca0b542b133e5497de7f07e352559db3cf9f951)\n\nThere is also incredible regional displacements and imbalances of refined products which will require product exports further increasing demand and rates. The storage glut may have reached it's peak but  that still does not change the fact that the unwinding of the storage will not be a swift process. In order to get back to the storage levels before the crisis we would have to be burning more than we did in 2019 and that is without the lack of flights, manufacturing, gasoline purchases, etc.\n\n# Supply and Orderbook\n\nTo understand the falling supply levels, you need to understand the difference between crude and product. Crude oil is very difficult to contaminate and has neglible effects when it is compared to products. Products are your vegatable oils, diesels, gasolines, and things with precise measurements and quality control so product tankers are coated with a special material that allows for easier cleaning and reduces contamination. An issue arises when the coating starts to dissolve and become less effective and usually normal tankers are scrapped after 25 years, but due to the nature of the product market and risk many key clients only employ vessels 15 years or younger.\n\n[Source: Scorpio Tankers](https://preview.redd.it/fmj50smb2lz41.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=014d8963beadadf8456819cf0cc33ffdf3fd5790)\n\nAccording to the 2020 orderbook, new vessels are at their all time lows. Until 2018, the number of vessels aging out at 15 years old had never exceeded new deliveries for a given year and the gap continues to widen as deliveries become more scarce.\n\nCompanies must also consider IMO 2030/2050 when deciding whether or not to order more tankers. With new unknown regulations coming in the next decade, there is a possibility any newly purchased ships may become obsolete depending on what regulations are announced. Companies must look to be more conservative until details start to become more clear, further widening the supply and demand gap.\n\n[Source: Scorpio Tankers](https://preview.redd.it/el00kmoc2lz41.png?width=1181&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2edc5d033522f044341df91437b59c4a7366de4)\n\nIt really is a simple fact of supply and demand, more product tankers are starting to come off the market than new ones coming in and demand is steadily increasing despite the shrinking supply.\n\n# Fundamentals\n\n[Source: Scorpio Tankers](https://preview.redd.it/po099y5e2lz41.png?width=550&format=png&auto=webp&s=6001ae5ac7a6a1d9dda7a5b93ee127a053374330)\n\nSTNG is currently trading at $17.11 as of May 18th, 2020 and have a market cap of about 1B dollars. In the first quarter of 2020, they made $254M which is about 1/4 of their market cap in one quarter. This also doesn\u2019t include the increase of revenue coming Q2 due to the rates or LR2, LR1 and MRs not rising till April.\n\nSTNG currently has a NAV of $34.52 providing a discount of about 56% with its current trading price of $17.11. They are currently sitting on $5.26B worth of assets for a company with a market cap of only $1B and are currently using a large portion of their free cash flow to pay down significant portions of their debt.\n\n# CEO Call Options\n\n>Scorpio Tankers Inc. (NYSE:[STNG](https://www.globenewswire.com/News/Listing?symbol=STNG&exchange=4)) (\u201cScorpio Tankers,\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) announced that the President of the Company, Robert Bugbee, has purchased call options on 315,100 common shares (or 3,151 call option contracts) of the Company with strike price of $15.00 and an expiration of January 2021 for the consideration of $1,963,291.\u201d (Source: [Scorpio Tankers](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/10/1998358/0/en/Scorpio-Tankers-Inc-Announces-Purchase-of-Call-Options-by-President-of-the-Company.html)).\n\nBugbee made this trade on March 11th when STNG\u00a0was trading at $15 most likely costing him about $6.23 per contract. That same trade today would cost about $6.65 per contract and assuming by expiration date STNG\u00a0is somewhere near it\u2019s current NAV we would see above 150% returns. Keep in mind this is purely NAV not accounting future earnings.\n\n# $250 Million Securities Repurchase Program\n\nIn 2015, STNG established a program where they had the ability to buyback shares up to $250 million and they still have the ability to purchase up to $121.6 million worth of its securities. With the recent cash flow increase, from their refinancing and rate spikes, they are well positioned to initiate several large buyback purchases within the year.\n\n>MONACO, May 12, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Scorpio Tankers, Inc. (NYSE: STNG) (the \u201cCompany\u201d) announced today that Scorpio Services Holding Limited (\u201cSSH\u201d), a related party, has purchased 100,000 common shares of the Company at an average price of $17.36 per share in the open market. The Company currently has 58,672,080 common shares outstanding, of which the Scorpio Group of companies, including SSH, owns 2,657,839 or 4.5%.\n\nThey have already used a small portion of that power and are expected to continue to use it the longer we stay under NAV. Keep in mind you can get in at a better price right now than the $17.36 paid.\n\n[Source: Scorpio Tankers](https://preview.redd.it/bj8um22h2lz41.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=0392ea2e57833925d7abb2f612f295d967d91ff2)\n\nUnder these new refinancing agreements, STNG\u2019s Q3 2020 and Q1 2021 debt obligations have been substantially reduced freeing up millions in capital, combined with their $204.2 million unrestricted cash balance this should guarantee their short-medium term survivability.\n\n# Institutional Purchases and Options Volume -\n\nJefferies Investment Advisers LLC increased their holdings by 1.2 million shares and many other funds are increasing their holdings over 100%+. Smart money is starting to pile in while retail is starting to pile out as the stock has been getting hammered over and over in the short term. Smart money is shaking small money away so they can get in cheap and ride this baby to the next super cycle.\n\nThe open interest on $STNG 1/15/2021 is 2.3 million most of which is on the $30 and $35 strike price, coincidentally right about NAV. By purchasing a $30 strike for January 2021 at about $2.5, if we see STNG at $40 anytime before expiration thats an easy 4x with 8 months worth of theta to exit.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThere are a lot of words and you probably skipped all of them\n\n$STNG 1/15/2021 $30 and $35 high risk\n\n$STNG 1/15/2021 $15 medium risk\n\n$STNG shares, risk free", "created_utc": 1589833813.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gm9ies/why_stng_isnt_a_meme_and_will_actually_bring_in/", "is_self": true}
