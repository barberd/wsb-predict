That is an implied share price of 75.15 aprox.. the current price of GrubHub is 70.70 on RH with market cap of 6.4B and a lower than average volume today (July 1st after close / July 2nd before open). The state of coronavirus in the EU and US is the counterpoint to my argument, as it could foreshadow some turbulence.\n\nTLDR/Conclusion: right now GrubHub could be a good buy, and moreso GrubHub's options could be especially active in the coming days and the price catches up to GrubHubs implied value being 14% higher than it's current value; For example, I bought calls at a strike price of and around $70 and they expire on the 17th. \n\nRead about the acquisition here:\n\n[MarketWatch Article](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/grubhubs-acquisition-by-just-eat-takeawaycom-creates-global-restaurant-delivery-giant-2020-06-10)\n\n[Barron's Article](https://www.barrons.com/articles/grubhub-is-being-bought-by-just-eat-takeaway-51591834466)\n\n[NY Times Article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/technology/uber-grubhub-just-eat.html)\n\nEdited: For Clarity", "created_utc": 1593683042.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hju37f/grub_acquisition_analysis_for_the_autists_dd_july/", "is_self": true}
