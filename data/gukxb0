{"id": "gukxb0", "title": "Taking a second look at $ITCI", "selftext": "After reading a previous post about $ITCI, I decided to dive into all of the data and break down all the technical jargon in an attempt to better understand the opportunity here. This is my first attempt at writing up my DD.\n\n**Positions:**\n\n**$ITCI Stock**\n\nPotential options:\n\n**$ITCI 6/19 $25c**\n\n**$ITCI 7/17 $25c**\n\n**Also a TL;DR at the bottom**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**WHAT is $ITCI?**\n\n$ITCI is Intra-Cellular Therapies, a biopharmaceutical company based in New York most known for its recently FDA-approved drug lumateperone (CAPLYTA), offering a unique take on schizophrenia treatment with very minimal side effects.\n\n**WHY are we looking at $ITCI?**\n\nThey have imminent data releases regarding large clinical trials that are expected to show positive results. One data release set for Q2, another set for mid-year 2020.\n\n**HOW do we profit from this?**\n\nHistorically, $ITCI has had large price spikes when positive data is released. Data release is imminent, likely beginning in June. Longer term outlook, if trial data is positive, further FDA approval and marketable drugs will provide ITCI with a much larger market in which to make money.\n\nLet's dive in.\n\nITCI has just recently had their drug, lumateperone (labeled CAPLYTA), approved by FDA for use at the end of 2019 after very positive clinical trials. This drug is used to treat schizophrenia, and compared to existing treatments, is novel in that the side effects are much more minimal. CAPLYTA sales/marketing began at the end of March, reporting \\~$880,000 in sales in just the last one or two weeks of Q1 (mainly to supply wholesalers). It's still early, but results from the clinical trials and the initial physician and patient reception has been positive.\n\nHowever, what we're looking at for the price spike is not the success of CAPLYTA, but rather the results of not one, but two upcoming data releases.\n\nThe first data release is regarding a clinical trial using lumateperone for treatment in bipolar disorder, which if successful, would greatly expand the market for ITCI's drug. This data release date per the most recent earnings call is \u201cmid-year 2020\u201d, however, another autist [makes the case for a June release here](https://medium.com/@codyenexile/another-itci-spike-incoming-diligence-done-8d625ff29754). The results of this trial are assumed to be positive because similar results were found in previous trials, [mentioned here](https://ir.intracellulartherapies.com/news-releases/news-release-details/intra-cellular-therapies-announces-positive-top-line-results-0).  This trial is Phase 3, which is the last step before FDA approval is granted.\n\nThe second release is regarding ITI-214, a separate treatment targeting patients with chronic systolic heart failure. This treatment acts as a PDE-1 inhibitor, which has shown positive results in heart treatment [example](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5513860/)\n\n[example 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6023290/).\n\nTI-214 has completed Phase 1-2 clinical trials and is awaiting results data \u201clater this quarter\u201d per the Q1 2020 earnings call this May (so, June 2020 release). Positive data from this trial would be very bullish for ITCI, as it could potentially open a whole new market for them - cardiac treatment in addition to psychoactive treatment.\n\n**ADDITIONAL PROS AND CONS:**\n\n**Pros:**\n\n1. Per the earnings call, the recent COVID events have not impeded the clinical trials. The launch of the CAPLYTA drug has also been successful in spite of COVID, thanks to telemedicine and online capability. In addition, patients have not stopped seeking treatment for mental conditions and physicians have not stopped providing care.\n\n2. Some large institutional investors, including BlackRock, have recently [increased their stake in ITCI](https://www.tickerreport.com/banking-finance/5649746/blackrock-inc-buys-527274-shares-of-intra-cellular-therapies-inc-nasdaqitci.html)\n\n3. In general, institutions have put in [$156M in Q2 2020 alone](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ITCI/institutional-ownership/), largest being Fidelity and BlackRock. This is much much larger than any other quarter so far\n\n4. Recent analyst price targets for ITCI have been positive, ranging from $26, to $35, to $50+.\n\n5. A competitor in schizophrenia treatment, Minerva Neurosciences ($NERV), recently reported disappointing Phase 3 trial results of their own, easing pressure on upcoming competitive threats.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n1. Despite reporting \\~$450 million in cash/cash equivalents and investment on the last earnings call, ITCI continues to burn money and is not yet in a position to reap big profits from CAPLYTA. Will need to keep an eye on financials if taking a long position.\n\n2. Although approved by the FDA and showing positive clinical trial results, CAPLYTA is very early and there are little real-world results to show for it as of now. Success of this drug is necessary for ITCI to stay relevant.\n\n3. Insider selling may be [a concern](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/ITCI/insider). There has also been very recent [insider buying though](https://newsfilter.io/articles/4-form-ac9be466332a794a156140ff7d3f1e06),I don't know enough about this shit to form an opinion so I'm putting it in Cons because brainlet.\n\n\n**//--TL;DR--//**\n\n**The Good:** history of price spikes on positive data, drug recently approved by FDA, next data releases imminent and likely to be positive based on past results\n\n**The Bad:** company has $450 mil cash but isn't making money yet; drug released and approved only recently, little data available on sales outlook and patient reception. Questionable insider buys/sells?\n\n**The Ugly:** look in the mirror\n\n\n**Positions: $ITCI Stock** (for the longer hold)\n\n**$ITCI 6/19 $25c** (banking on June data releases)\n\n**$ITCI 7/17 $25c** (coverage in case data is released late June or early July)", "created_utc": 1591019207.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gukxb0/taking_a_second_look_at_itci/", "is_self": true}
