{"id": "h990t1", "title": "Interesting Week Ahead", "selftext": "For the upcoming week, it seems like the general consensus is that the market will be red. The reasons behind this are the obvious grim economic fundamentals (i.e. unemployment rate, reduced spending, expected low Q2 earning, gdp, struggles in the Main Street) confirmed by Powell and the rise in Covid19 numbers in various states and even in different parts of Asia. Logically speaking, it only makes sense that the market will go down, if not tank. \n\nHowever, this is an interesting week based on what I have seen during the last three months. During these months, there were also many obvious indicators that everyone could see coming from miles away. Some of the examples that I still recall are the GDP report week and unemployment rate report weeks after the shutdown and massive furloughs and firing and, based on these indicators, many people bet against the market. However, interestingly, whenever people bet with sound and foreseeable indicators, the market reacted in an opposite direction. There were also some moments when the negative news did affect the market negatively (Trump's trade war declaration against China, Buffet selling off his stocks, Fauci's grim covid19 forecast during the senate hearing). However, the negative effects from these events were short lived as the market shrugged them off within few days. \n\nSo, for me, the interesting question is how will the market react this time? We are all betting that the market will turn red based on fairly obvious indicators that we have been expecting. Will the market shrug them off again just because these were obvious and many have been anticipating already, or will it be different this time?\n\nTruly interesting and potentially ominous week that we have ahead.", "created_utc": 1592195757.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h990t1/interesting_week_ahead/", "is_self": true}
