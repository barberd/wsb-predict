Spare a Jigglypuff \ud83d\udc96 crown DLC \ud83d\udc9f or an update patch. \ud83d\udc8c\n\nThe Serious DD:\n\nI think there's a tic on my foot. \u274c\u274c I was and remain high as a kite \ud83d\ude0e\ud83c\udf41\n\nI was cutting my toe nails like one does every quarter when I noticed a weird red bump on my toe!!! I clipped off some of the nail and I swear I saw \ud83d\udc41 a raised bump with little legs and I freaked out \u2620\n\n\nFirst, I tore off as much of the nail as I could with the nail clippers. \ud83c\udf19 Then I saw the bump!!! I tried holding a piece of toilet\ud83d\udebd paper \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3 (free my boi Sherpa Shkreli in Tibet) covered in 90% isopropyl alcohol against what I could see of the red bump for like 10sec. \u23f0\n\nI was like 30% sure there was a tic. I wouldn't go all-in, more like $20 max. Anyway, I tore off the externalmost (measuring from where I imagine the tic head would be) 85% of this red bump, possibly with legs, on my skin.\n\nI'm wearing old ass glasses because my insurance only covers glasses or contacts so my eyesight was/remains subpur \ud83d\ude0e (relevant soon)\n\nI thought Bernie was too old immediately after the heart attack, but now I'm like whatever, let's talk about socialism baby get riggity rekt I want Season 4 on Hulu, I'll take a man prone to dying of a heart attack and having some PC socialist replacement VP who will pay for me to get this tic on my toe seen by a medical professional.\n\nI'n too dumb to know if I have a diseased and/or pest-carrying toe. I don't want to spend 3hrs reading about it. I want to spend one getting my toe looked at by a slutty psych major turned PA with big, fake tits. One hour is better than three. Long Bernie Sanders. Dicks Out For Bernie.\n\ntl;dr Long marijuana, health care, marijuana health care, and an eventual Bernie Sanders candidacy", "created_utc": 1577591450, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eh12xq/my_employer_doesnt_test_for_marijuana/", "is_self": true}
