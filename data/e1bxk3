{"id": "e1bxk3", "title": "$DIS thank you Mickey.", "selftext": "Hey autists, this throwaway finally old enough to post here. Been making massive tendies in $DIS since before earnings and subs announce. \n\nDisney is massively undervalued from a P/E perspective, or frankly, any way you want to look at it. Disney is worth a Disney plus a Netflix so you do that math. I did and I got 190-200. Plenty of upside left. Just take your free money and keep rolling it forward. \n\nLast week stonk consolidated, affirmed mid 140s. If we look at this week we see HK had pro dem elections. China hasn\u2019t rolled the tanks in... yet. China still wants a deal w Daddy. Frozen 2 is blockbuster and Baby Yoda will be under every Xmas tree. Clever people gonna start extrapolating subs from iOS/Android app downloads even if we don\u2019t get new numbers - and you can be certain these numbers will melt faces. Also the new Star Wars gonna nerdgasm the entire internet. All this means new ATHs for Disney in a really profound sort of way. \n\nLet\u2019s make some Mickey money. \n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/ktSHwsv", "created_utc": 1574662864, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e1bxk3/dis_thank_you_mickey/", "is_self": true}
