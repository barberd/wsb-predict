The bubble has yet to burst.\n\nUp to millions of Americans are sucking the teet of the government thanks to recent stimulus action. \n\nA laid off server in my FB group signed for a brand new car. This guy was not a manager or even a supervisor. How the fuck was he we able to afford it? He can\u2019t afford it. He thinks all deferred liability(car and rent), and pending government checks means that he thinks he is in a financial safe haven. On top of buying a new car, he wants to spend 2k in modifications already. \n\n\nBut the fuck will happen when the government\u2019s teets run dry or can\u2019t keep its udder\u2019s inflated?\n\nHe and many millions of retarded Americans will be fuktus. The government can\u2019t keep deferring payments. And nor will they cut nearly enough checks beyond a month or two of runway.   \n\nPoint is, the government has stalled out the true economic hurricane for these people. When the government runs out of options, these people will be swimming in a world of shit. Late rent late car payments. Defaulting left and right. \n\nThere are countless retards like this walking blindfolded on eggshells in America. \n\n\nTLDR: 4/17 SPY PUTS", "created_utc": 1584852405.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmu7n6/reminder_the_real_bubble_has_yet_to_burst/", "is_self": true}
