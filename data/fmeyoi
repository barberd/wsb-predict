{"id": "fmeyoi", "title": "[DD] $SBUX is gonna sink!", "selftext": "So I did some diggings by PUTTING myself as a SPY under r/Starbucks and other related posts. \n\n1. Apparently some stores are still asking the baristas to work even Starbucks corporate sent out a notice that employees can staying at home and still get paid for 30 days. The managers twisted the notice and said \u201cthis is for the stores that are already closed. You still need to show up in my store to get paid.\u201d And this happens in different stores.\n\n2. Some DT stores in USA cities are still [busy](https://i.imgur.com/DDE781m.jpg) and [busy](https://imgur.com/gallery/jde4Puo). But people are still [negligent ](https://i.imgur.com/RxduCpm.jpg) there. These violent delights have violent ends. It will only end up with a news saying people catch the beer virus in Starbucks.\n\n3. Some other stores are just dead and continue to be dead. \n[UK example](https://imgur.com/gallery/9DxkG4M)\n[Bleeding on money](https://imgur.com/gallery/HNSlOon) \n\n4. I ran into a no drive-through Starbucks in my town yesterday and the barista told me that they are very slow while some other store nearby are already closed. (And after that, last night Starbucks ask all stores to be drive-through only in Canada). I drove and checked some other stores in the other busy places. It is only grab & go and drive-through. The business is pathetic. 3 employees inside and definitely too many of them for such business.\n[Empty af](https://imgur.com/gallery/S5l5Tgy)\n\nI asked the baristas personally \u201chow is the business\u201d and they all responded \u201cvery slow and I am expecting them to be closed down before long\u201d.\n\n5. I am going to check the downtown area today around 3-4pm since Google map says it is the busiest time for those Starbucks stores on Saturday. Will come back and update.\n\nTLDR: ALL in $SBUX 4/17 50p. Plus their puts are still cheap compared to the others.", "created_utc": 1584797318.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmeyoi/dd_sbux_is_gonna_sink/", "is_self": true}
