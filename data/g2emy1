All they can do is keep them around being fed while more supply keeps pilling up.\n\nCan trade options on futures for live cattle under the ticker LE.\n\n**TLDR - Live Cattle piling up with nowhere to go, LE 80p Jun/20**\n\nP.S. I'm a complete N00b to Cattle Futures, so this should be considered for entertainment purposes only.", "created_utc": 1587042742.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2emy1/meat_plants_shattering_with_live_cattle_having/", "is_self": true}
