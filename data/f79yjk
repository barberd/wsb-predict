Obviously as I am a fucking autistic I bought a couple of hundreds on it.\n\nI also put it into the v6 of the spreedsheet and it says is on a dip, all parameters on green so probably is a really good moment to buy. Just putting this on my fav subreddit so that all of you fucking autistic can buy it before it propably goes to the moon.\n\nIf any one has something to say, please denate below, I want you to tell me how genious/retarded I am, (the correct one is the second one). \n\nLove you retards\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f.", "created_utc": 1582285651, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f79yjk/ally_to_the_moon/", "is_self": true}
