That\u2019s Not Even the Worst-Case Scenario.\u201d\n\n[https://www.barrons.com/articles/high-yield-bond-default-says-citigroup-not-worst-case-scenario-51586186298](https://www.barrons.com/articles/high-yield-bond-default-says-citigroup-not-worst-case-scenario-51586186298)\n\nOriginally, I was going warn you autists that we are going into earnings season at high multiples based on street revisions for the E in forward P/E (due to coronavirus). Then I realized as long as there is a bigger retard able and willing to hold the bag none of this matters.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/si5o0yii81s41.png?width=273&format=png&auto=webp&s=427b44a6365f22560fd758959e690007f79a9e95\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIll preface by saying I agree with most of what the FED is doing to address the pandemic. They are providing **liquidity** to a stressed system and on balance it is beneficial. The caveats are that I doubt they will act appropriately coming out of this crisis and the FED is now brazenly altering capital markets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BUYING CORPORATE DEBT & EQUITIES**\n\nFor the first time, on March 23, 2020, the FED announced it would be buying investment grade corporate debt in the primary and secondary markets. 18 days later the FED said it will also buy high yield (junk) debt though ETFs. What\u2019s next in unlimited QE? Equites. I was ok with buying treasuries, skeptical about buying investment grade corporates and scared that they are buying high yield debt. The analogy like watching someone prescribed oxy moving on to heroin and then fentanyl. It\u2019s a slippery slope and while I think it is unlikely the FED will buy Equity ETFs (Japan proved there were no benefits) so far its clear they are unrestrained.\n\n[https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200323b.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200323b.htm)\n\n[https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200409a.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200409a.htm)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**RISK AND REWARD**\n\nImagine you are responsible (doubt it) and bought safe AAA bonds yielding 3% where as scumbag Steve bought BB bonds yielding 6%. Steve makes more money but when a downturn comes my bonds will exist while steve\u2019s may not. Crisis hits and now the FED steps in and buys steve\u2019s junk bond and anything else his company issues. I earned less money than steve for the same risk. Risks are now rewarded so I lever up: buy into high yield and leveraged debt and sell CDS on all BB and higher bonds until they reach 0. The AAA company is no cuck either and will take advantage of this by levering up its balance sheet to enhance earnings. All of this seems kind of like 2008 except now the government bodies encourage this behavior.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I THOUGHT THE FED WASN\u2019T ABLE TO BUY CORPORATE BONDS/EQUITIES**\n\nHave no fear Jerome Powell J.D. is here. The federal reserve is not supposed to lose money nor can it buy corporate bonds or equities. But what if the US Government sets up a trust (SPV) that buys corporate bonds, equities and 5 Brooklyn Bridges. Well the FED now is buying government assets, perfect! How about losses? No problem, you see the trust is backed by the US government and they can issue new debt (that the fed also buys) or tax their future. Sensational!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1d6m7pes61s41.png?width=267&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9bef2faf482c321652d3cd7e228c8a91d0da4c5\n\n**FED INDEPENDENCE**\n\nBut wait wouldn\u2019t that meant the US Government is also complicit with this scheme? Yes.\n\nLet\u2019s be honest with ourselves the US Federal Reserve cannot be independent. Board members are appointed by the president and voted on by the Senate. The Fed claiming to be independent is like saying the HR of my company has my best interest in mind. These esteemed academics have other less obvious considerations as well. \u201cI can\u2019t be the headline on why the stock market crashed\u201d. \u201cI have a pension that will lose value if markets fall\u201d. \u201cThe easier decision has less career risk\u201d. This is speculation of course but it is what I would thinking about.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pdxauey871s41.png?width=371&format=png&auto=webp&s=e115dd561e90079aaad245cca8d9b749a667a45d\n\n**TLDR:** FED IS TELLING YOU TO GEAR THE FUCK UP. MAX OUT YOUR MARGIN TO BUY EQUITIES, LEVERAGED AND HIGH YIELD DEBT. WRITE CDS TILL IT GOES TO 0. BUY AS MANY HOMES AS YOU CAN ON MORTGAGE. SPY C 5/15 5000.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1586543166.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fylhna/the_fed_is_independent_and_not_a_degenerate/", "is_self": true}
