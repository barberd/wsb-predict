VZO also indicates bullishness in the near term. \n\nA peak and then fall will come as SPY hits upper projection bands, is overbought, and demand index falls below zero. So, watch out for this in your future analysis. Likely coming in next week\u2019s end or soon thereafter. Or donnie will pull out his tweet cannon and Jpow will drop kick gay bears to space. GL\n\nEdit: I thought I could skirt the retards with technicals. Lol\n\nEdit 2: I should mention that you should keep up to date on your technicals rather than stick to a price target. Either way, 293 my target (Fib Retrace); 350 jpow target GL\n\nEdit 3: Constructive criticism is always welcome.", "created_utc": 1586564420.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fysjeq/bullish_in_the_short_term/", "is_self": true}
