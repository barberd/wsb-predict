Here are some prime longer term opportunities (~3 months) for huge payoffs beyond just buying random SPY and QQQ FD puts\n\nThe main impact of a viral outbreak will be approximately 10%-20% of patients requiring hospital care.\u00a0 Most of these will be old or medically vulnerable people.\u00a0\n\nNow, everyone knows that US hospitals are ludicrously overpriced and this is only manageable by the average US citizen through healthcare insurance.\n\nHow healthcare insurance works is that the policy buyer pays expenses out of pocket up until a certain level called the deductable.\u00a0 So the hospital bills the healthcare insurance agency based upon pre-defined rates for certain types of care, the healthcare insurance will pay for a certain percentage, typically 80% of costs above the annual deductable.\n\nSo what happens when an unprecedented number of people get sick and require hospital care above the deductable?\u00a0 The health insurance companies will have to pay money out their ass to cover all the bills.\u00a0 An epidemic of this scale has not been priced into their models.  This means that US healthcare companies are about to take a huge hit, especially those with high exposure to old or medically vulnerable demographics.  Thankfully there are government insurance programs specifically geared towards these demographics: Medicare and, to a lesser extent,  Medicaid. So we have a handy way to figure out which companies are going to get fucked the hardest. \n\nWhat puts to buy:\nHUM 5/15 300P - Humana is a huge provider of Medicare (75% of revenue!) which means they are highly exposed to the most vulnerable segment of the population that will require the most care in this outbreak.\u00a0 They are going to smashed into oblivion by the hospital bills from waves of dying senior citizens.\n\nCNC 6/20 50P - Centene corporation is also heavily involved in Medicare and Medicaid plans (66% of revenue) so they have high exposure to vulnerable individuals.   They've also been focused on growth and mergers which makes them vulnerable financially  \n\nUNH 6/20 250P - United Healthcare Group has 80% of its revenues coming from healthcare insurance and are the biggest provider by far.  Backup in case the government decides to bail out Medicare/Medicaid providers\n\nMy positions: about $11k cost basis of 5/15 HUM, 6/20 UNH, 6/20 CNC puts at various strikes\n\nTL;DR buy 5/15 HUM 300P, 6/20 UNH 250P, and CNC 6/20 50P", "created_utc": 1583246926, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcvlri/healthcare_insurance_companies/", "is_self": true}
