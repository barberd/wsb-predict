{"id": "foe71c", "title": "$OXY", "selftext": "Virus will be over one way or the other in 3-9 months. Saudi/OPEC versus Russia oil trade war will end in the coming months as both nations have had their economies damaged by the virus and require massive stimulus so they cannot squander both their currency &amp; oil reserves needlessly on a prolonged price war. Energy stocks had been battered prior to collapse and weren\u2019t overvalued compared to tech stocks, so when energy stocks lost 90% of their value they were still at a relative discount compared to other sectors. Even worst case scenario economy/productivity/trade/travel only rises back to 70%-90% by year\u2019s end, you assume $OXY will retract gains in its stock price : (1) jointly as economic activity normalizes and quarantined areas are lifted in phases as $OXY was trading above $40 approximate one month ago before virus hit; (2) OXY raises dividends again as business normalizes and it is able; and (3) OPEC/Russia end the price war and cut production to increase prices. You have Icahn increasing his position, while Buffet also holds a position in $OXY. Long the market. Trust in man. I\u2019ve bought September 2020 and January 2021 calls at a $10 strike. Godspeed.\n\nEDIT: I take a long term macro realpolitik analysis in my trading. Energy (much like Boeing, auto, etc.) is a vital national security interest. I believe this stock is poised for rebound based on the factors above, but I also hold a firm belief that worst case scenario: (1) a lifeline will be thrown to US energy through loan restructuring: and/or (2) $OXY will be prime for takeover by a rival which will also increase the price. Worst case and only if needed I believe it likely $OXY will be able to restructure any debts to longer repayment terms, but I guess my detractors believe cruise services are more vital to national security than energy independence as we enter into this new post-globalism era where vital supply chains/resources (e.g. energy, pharma/med manufacturing, etc.) are protected for national security interests.", "created_utc": 1585087308.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/foe71c/oxy/", "is_self": true}
