{"id": "gr9pzb", "title": "Sell TLT and SPY puts both as a trade pair ?", "selftext": "I feel like I should buy puts on both TLT and Spy right now. there any possibility that TLT dumps and Spy dumps together? We have seen a lot of weird shit lately so it wouldn\u2019t be surprising, just having a hard time playing the same stocks now when the good  growth stocks hit new ATH territory and now it doesn\u2019t look like we have many entries left. The banks and real estate, and maybe some value stocks can be played. Today the run on value stocks started and It\u2019s either we are in for a massive bull market that will take us to new ATH in a lot of value stocks, and TLT does go back down or we have a big pullback coming. Either way wouldn\u2019t one of the more likely outcomes happen causing one of them to dump enough to cover the other? Or is there a better way to strangle the market and bonds together?", "created_utc": 1590541355.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gr9pzb/sell_tlt_and_spy_puts_both_as_a_trade_pair/", "is_self": true}
