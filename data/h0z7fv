States reopening, improved economic data, printer go brrrr, blah, blah you all know. You all also know degenerates, like myself, have been populating RH faster than a group of homeless people getting into an abandoned car, its an absolute soup kitchen in there. Everyone\u2019s been drowning themselves in calls and buying up stock and big money is very aware of that fact and they\u2019re about to take your money like taking candy from a retard as you all panic sell and pray to our lord and savior JPow for forgiveness. Stonks needed a pullback, period. Tech has been overbought more than the only hot corner street hooker and she needs a break from all the pumping. So relax, pop a Xanax and if you have calls that don\u2019t expire in June then as Aaron Rodgers says, \u201cR-E-L-A-X\u201d. I ain\u2019t fucking selling.", "created_utc": 1591881718.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h0z7fv/its_all_just_a_fugazi_so_everyone_relax/", "is_self": true}
