Hope the formatting works\n\nRevenue\nThe bar is low.....expecting only 59.7B revenue vs 51B last year.(72.38B last quarter). \n\nPrediction: They easily beat on revenue.\n\nAWS\nAnalysts are expecting 7.7B, last quarter was 7.4B...this will smashed by at least 2B.\nMSFT grew cloud by 41% to 9.6B....if AMZN is close to a 40% gain, it puts AWS over 10B (7.4B last quarter)\n\nPrediction: Absolutly kills it in cloud\n\nDOD deal\n10B DOD cloud deal up for grabs..AMZN is the only company with DOD DISA L6 security level. MSFT is expecting to get it..but has not received it yet. \nPrediction: Could go either way. The government seems to wants MSFT but without clearance AMZN gets it\n\nEPS\nAnalyst expect 4.72 eps vs 6.04,5.75,5.07 last 3 quarter. Costs will be up, but also revenue up...this will be close to expected.\n\nOutlook\nAMZN finally announce they are out of china but will still sell there..they were taking a loss on this market. AMZN is the cloud leader and the market is sky rocketing, we saw this from MSFT. Even though msft is catching up..there is still plenty of money for both companies. Things look good\n\nWhat about the stock\nAs with always..Bad earnings or good earnings...AMZN stock could go either direction.\n\nRSI &gt; 70, overbought but that didn't matter for MSFT\n\nThe $1925 straddle is priced for a 4% move. AMZN shouldnt move below $1809 or above $2002.\n\nLast quarter Amazon rose sharply into earnings(+2.8% day of)..but lost it after the ER..basically flat overall.", "created_utc": 1556206552, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bha1pr/amzn_earnings_dd/", "is_self": true}
