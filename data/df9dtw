We've got to find some way to figure out which are the next Chinese companies that are going to be banned or vice versa.\n\nMaybe you're a foreign exchange student just starting month two of his China semester and you see someone dumping a tank full of chemicals in the drainage ditch behind your 20 story shared-room dorm...what is the name of the company on the side of that tank?\n\nMaybe you're from San Fransisco and you overheard a Chinese guy at the McDonald's on Mission Street saying, \"blah blah IBM AI,\" -- what was on his TShirt?  If it was written in Chinese, and you don't read Chinese can you describe the lettering some how?  Was it up-down-sideways upside down \"7\" or more of a box with a strike through it?\n\nFuck, maybe you're a Chinese Redditor and you just know some shit - like maybe you're sitting there in Beijing and you notice a bunch of Coca Cola trucks getting pulled over by police mysteriously on your commute home.  That would be good for us to know.\n\nAny little pieces of information like that would be good to know. I'm looking for leading indicators and special knowledge from areas where the mainstream media does not typically go, none of this, \"hey they were talking about this on fucking CNBC two days later,\" bullshit - the money is already long gone for that type of thing.\n\nBetter yet, if you are part of the Chinese Communist Politiburo or the Trump Administration and just want to let us know what's going to happen next, that would be great.", "created_utc": 1570581996, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/df9dtw/discussion_does_anyone_live_by_any_chinese/", "is_self": true}
