Can I \"delete\" the collection letters too?", "selftext": "Hi all, I had a negative balance (-$13,567.32 to be exact) on Robinhood so when I heard about TD Ameritrade going 0 commission, I deleted Robinhood so I could have a fresh start.\n\nCouple questions:\n\n1) Will my negative balance automatically carry over to TD?\n2) I've received two collection letters from Robinhood.  Since I deleted the app I don't expect I'll owe anything more.  But in case more letters come, will throwing them out automatically cancel the debt?\n3) If I reinstall Robinhood, can I start at 0 again if I sign up with a different email address and username?\n\nThanks in advance.", "created_utc": 1570385876, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/de70ym/deleted_robinhood_after_td_went_free_trades_can_i/", "is_self": true}
