The younger generations don't have a stake in the success of society. We don't care about it.\n\nWe loose nothing if it fails, we're already at bottom, and most of us don't want to be alive anyways.\n\nYes, there will be some comment about some nerd who's doing well, probably because he performed fellatio. That's not the point - the point is the **AVERAGE** person used to have a great life on an **AVERAGE** salary.\n\nThat is no longer the case, the **AVERAGE** person with an **AVERAGE** salary today, has a shitty life, and that's why we gamble.\n\nIf I loose everything, I'm not much worse off than I am now; and there's never been a better time in history to be rich.\n\nWe're not greedy, we just want the carrot we were promised after going through your bullshit scam schooling system for 20 years.", "created_utc": 1582869263, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/faq3od/an_open_letter_to_boomers_from_bloomberg/", "is_self": true}
