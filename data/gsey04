{"id": "gsey04", "title": "$CLDR: High as a Cloud", "selftext": "TL;Dr\n\nWhy Cloudera will have some of the sexiest and bullish earnings of any cloud company we have seen. \n\n\nCloudera is a similar company to $Net and $Box  both of which saw huge run ups to earnings. The fact that Cloudera is a cloud company alone is enough to have a huge push as earnings approach. In addition Cloudera has minimal exposure to small businesses and actually has many huge customers. Some of the more known ones are, Intel, HelloFresh, U.S. Census Bureau, Hilton, and Bank of America. \n\nNow what exactly does Cloudera do? Cloudera is aiming to helps organizations and enterprises with how they use and manage their data through their cloud based service. Their cloud service provides real time analytics that are perfect for the for large companies. \nThey provide a software platform for data engineering, data warehousing, machine learning and analytics that runs in the cloud. With that being said let\u2019s look at their numbers and why they will beat their .01 EPS expectation and the 204.65M of revenue. Before that though it\u2019s also important to look at their pre-crash trading price which sat between $11-$12. Currently trading just below 10 this stock still has room to recover and it\u2019s earnings blast will send it to new highs.\n\n\nLast quarter CLDR reported an EPS of .04, which beat by over 200%. They posted a revenue of 211m, which is more then their expected this quarter. As we have seen so far, this quarter has heavily favored cloud companies especially ones with little small business exposure in terms of earnings and it is very likely the same thing will go for CLDR. In addition their revenue has continued to increase over the last 4 quarters.\n\nQ1 2020- Revenue 188 M\n\nQ2 2020- Revenue 196 M\n\nQ3 2020 - Revenue 198 M\n\nQ4 2020- Revenue- 211 M\n\nAs you can see this company has sustained a very consistent revenue increase which makes it even more likely they will continue this in a quarter where cloud data and analytics becomes all that much more important. \n\n\nHowever possibly the best numbers are that Cloudera has only ever missed revenue or EPS once in company history. This illustrates their sustained growth and promise and it is likely that will continue through this quarter.\n\n11c or 10c 6/19\n\nDon\u2019t miss another cloud play like you did with $Box", "created_utc": 1590700355.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gsey04/cldr_high_as_a_cloud/", "is_self": true}
