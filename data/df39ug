{"id": "df39ug", "title": "Long on VRAY", "selftext": "Source: I am a medical physicist (someone who uses/QAs radiation oncology machines).\n\n\nVRAY or ViewRAY has an interesting strategic position as 1 of 2 groups selling a  radiotherapy x-ray delivery machine (called a Linac) combined with a MRI (MRI-Linac or MRL). The other company is Elekta (EKTAY), who is selling a machine with a stronger MRI magnet then ViewRAY. The Elekta Machine is fundamentally better in many ways, and also more expensive (at $10M per unit).\n\n\nThe reason I think VRAY is a good buy is because when the technology matures and we actually know the true value of these machines, VRAY has a simple advantage: their machines are smaller. Old linacs are replaced by new ones all the time, but a radiation shielding study needs to be done to make sure you're not irradiating the public too much. Building the rooms (called linac vaults) are typically 30-50% the cost of the actual machine (potentially even more for an MRL because you need to shield for the MRI, not just the Linac), For technical reasons, less radiation escapes from a MRL then a conventional linac so no vault in America (the largest and most advanced market for radiotherapy per capita) will require additional shielding for either VRAY or Elekta MRLs.\n\n\nThe problem is, an Elekta MRL (called Unity) can't fit inside any currently existing linac vaults. The ViewRAY MRL (called MRIdian) can. The largest market in America for radiotherapy is not large academic institutions, its large hospital groups serving many, many small rural clinics. \n\n\nI see that the stock dropped a ton recently, mostly due to investor BS and a class action suit against them. They're physicists, not financiers. I'm buying now at ~$2.70 and targeting $9-$10 long.", "created_utc": 1570555933, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/df39ug/long_on_vray/", "is_self": true}
