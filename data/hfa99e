{"id": "hfa99e", "title": "Comparing the current situation to the start of June", "selftext": "At the start of this month, SPY was pretty much the same exact level that we are at right now.\n\nAt the start of June, people were hyped about reopenings, strongly decreasing covid infection rates even though people finally could go outside, the expectation of rapidly decreasing unemployment and some Q1 results that were far better than expected. It was the perfect time for the SPY to continue it's climb.\n\nRight now, we are getting flooded by news of massive covid spikes, new quarantene rulings, biden most likely winning the presidency according to polls, possible lockdowns, Cramer telling people to sell (yes this is important for a lot of people, he led a lot of boomers up the bullrun), cruise lines delaying new travels, and last weeks continuing unemployment was horrible stuff. Q2 results arent in sight quite yet, so even IF they should exceed expectations, they wont have an effect for the couple next weeks. Tech stocks reached ATH, so it's hard to imagine they will be able to continue to carry the bullrun alone.\n\nSo my question is, what would be indicators or arguments for a positive sentiment or for the SPY to go up again? I like to get both sides, and right now only thing i can think of is a positive bank stress test, but that is quite lightweight compared to the other sentiments.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: Sentiment and news bad compared to start of June imo, what makes you think stonks go up next weeks**", "created_utc": 1593035332.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hfa99e/comparing_the_current_situation_to_the_start_of/", "is_self": true}
