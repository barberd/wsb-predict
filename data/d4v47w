{"id": "d4v47w", "title": "GE Power Conversion Sold!", "selftext": "But to an unknown buyer! They were advertising a turn key 1500V input shipping container that would make setting up a 2.8 MW Solar farm a breeze. Couple it with FSLR series 6 panels and you are making a modest 4-6% guaranteed for 30 years with a PPA. So I was looking at property that could support such an endeavor, because you could make a fuck ton of money selling people 3% nearly guaranteed yields and scalping the rest, but now I\u2019ve got to figure out another easy inverter solution. \n\nTL;DR anyone know who might have bought? GE is the best at buying high and selling low, and their former power conversion business is about to blossom as utilities start getting hardons for solar.", "created_utc": 1568604475, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d4v47w/ge_power_conversion_sold/", "is_self": true}
