This is especially important for Japan as their recovery is largely export-led.\n\nMy thesis is that the Bank of Japan, won't let traders buying into the Yen to appreciate it too much, because it will significantly hamper Japan's economic recovery (which has only been tepid, at best). Any increase in the value of the Yen, I expect, will be met by a Bank of Japan that continues to aggressively sell the Yen to buy largely U.S. Dollar-denominated assets. \n\nMy proposed play is to take advantage of the recent appreciation in the Yen and short it relative to the U.S. Dollar. However, I would probably want to wait until the Chinese retaliation is announced, since that volatility should drive traders to the Yen. \n\nWhat do you guys think?", "created_utc": 1557711316, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bnwy9w/short_the_japanese_yen/", "is_self": true}
