The CEO revealed that they are working with the US government. At the moment only large cap companies like MMM are known to be doing so. Being a small cap company the revenue from PPE (personal protective equipment) is going to increase OMI's value substantially.\n2. The market showed interest immediately after the Cramer show. Stock price went up 23.6% in AH immediately after interview.\n3. This company has distribution centers in the US and Europe for exporting medical supplies.\n4. Manufacturing done in America! No supply chain issues. Other competitors who manufacture in China saw their production shut down due to the Lunar New Year and beyond due to the virus.\n\n**The Company**\n\nOwens and Minor ($OMI) is a global manufacturing and distribution medical supply company with offices in the US and Europe. They make masks and gloves and other crap that helps in the beer flu crisis. Their CEO, Ed Pesicka, originally an executive from Thermal Fisher, joined Owens and Minor about a year ago. He's been fixing the customer service which bled the company for years. Restructuring the company for the past 9-10 months back to industry standard. It beat EPS in the last 3 quarters. Ed Pesicka is getting results.\n\n**Meeting Demand**\n\nEd sees mask demand in NYC rise from 20k to 200k-300k per week in just one hospital. The company has ramped up production to meet demand in medical protective gear. From January to end of February there was an increase of 50 million mask production per month. They are **working closely with the FEMA, the white house team, and HHS**.\n\nThere will be a substantial increase in future demand. CDC guidance on masks is expected to [change](https://twitter.com/DrMattMcCarthy/status/1243891663162019841) in next 10 days. Americans will be advised to wear masks in everyday life. Current recommendation is for high-risk groups only.\n\n**Exporting**\n\nThey seem to be in a position to sell masks to Europe as well as they have distribution centers there. Trump keeps saying we can sell ventilators to Europe. Why not sell other flu gear as well?\n\n60+ of their distribution centers are located in the US, with 11 in [Europe](https://www.owens-minor.com/our-solutions/distribution-and-warehousing/). Logistics already in place for exporting.\n\n**Comparing with other corona virus stocks**\n\nThe advantage of OMI over other similar stocks like APT is that we know they're working with the US government. Like MMM, but with a much smaller market cap. The revenue from the increased demand will make this stock undervalued.\n\n**Possible Future Catalysts**\n\n1. Change in CDC guidance. Americans wearing masks everyday.\n2. Name called by Mike Pence just like MMM! There will be a much more significant effect due to the market cap size.\n3. Earnings in two months. Expect it to beat EPS by a large margin due to the January to February ramp up with a very good guidance.\n\n**Magical Technical**\n\n1. This stock has not gone parabolic like the others like APT, CODX have. Still cheap!\n2. Blew away several resistance levels in AH after interview with Cramer - $6, $6.5, $7. Bounced off at $7.8\n3. Break out above resistance at $7.8, HUGE gap up to about $17. Now at 6.81.\n4. Comparing how much other small cap virus stocks have performed, this will jump to $15-$20 and falls back to about $10 (like the others). The size of the gap also suggests a jump of that size.\n\nTL:DR - $10 calls, ticker OMI.", "created_utc": 1585475815.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fr3jk0/owens_and_minors_medical_ppe_working_with_the_us/", "is_self": true}
