The stock is a time bomb about to go off faster than a lonely backpack on a park bench.\n\nNFLX loses BILLIONS in cash every year and doesn\u2019t seem to be stopping anytime soon.\n\nNot only that but for the first time in history the sales growth is slowing down. \n\nThey are getting actual viable competition as well now compared to that depressed unknown high schooler HULU. DIS and AAPL are going to smash Netflix and take over the streaming industry.\n\nDIS has a monthly cost of only $7.00 while the full version of NFLX costs fookin $16.00. Who ain\u2019t going to switch to DIS and get that sweet deal.\n\nThe only reason NFLX got where it is, is because of there move against Blockbuster. I tell you what though, AAPL and DIS are definitely going to beat NFLX\u2019s ass this time.\n\nShort NFLX.", "created_utc": 1579454490, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eqz4sr/nflx_is_insanely_overpriced/", "is_self": true}
