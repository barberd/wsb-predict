{"id": "e65gaz", "title": "WSB ETF $TONKS (Return since inception)", "selftext": "u/TheGlennDavid finally put together an etf that includes all the dumb shit people talk about in this sub everyday.\n\n[Here's a link to his post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e60d4q/wsb_etf_tonks_a_look_at_what_you_talked_about/)\n\nSince I'm bored as fuck and have access to m1 finance I figured I'd throw these tickers into a portfolio to see how well they've been doing.\n\nSince inception the $TONKS ETF has returned 17.22%\n\nInception was May 10, 2019. *aka* the day $UBERs valuation cut in half. To be fair -50% is better than every one of your Robinhood all time graphs.\n\nFor reference, in this same period $SPY has returned 8.38%\n\nHere's the math for those of you who can't read yet\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|ETF|May 10th|December 3rd|Return|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|$SPY|$285.62|$309.55|8.38%|\n|$TONKS|$100|$117.22|17.22%|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt costs about 90k to create an ETF so if anyone here hasn't yolo'd that money into PTON calls yet, I'd park my retirement account in $TONKS for the memes.\n\nDisclaimer 1: We haven't seen $TONKS during a downturn but since stonks only go up I think it's safe\n\nDisclaimer 2: 17.22% will not buy a yacht, coke, or hookers.
