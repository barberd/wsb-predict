These were all realized within a few hours after the market closed. There's still Saturday and Sunday for more potential news, and at this rate, it doesn't look too pleasing. \n\nThere may have been a pump from Powell initially around 30 minutes prior to market closure, but that failed. Then, there was the last 15 minutes were you all held your cocks before you began your long $ROPE into Monday, you greedy shits. I am a greedy shit as well, and yes, I held my puts like a god damn champion. Why? Every hair on my body screams red, and no you retards, it's not a sunburn.\n\nEveryone holding their ballsack puts like myself, prepare yourself for a tough ass day on Monday. My predictions lie within the opening day being green, but end of the day being red. People were cock pumped to the heavens with hope due that 15 minute rally, and it will continue until lunch. \n\nFor the entire past week, we have noticed a general trend regardless of it opening red or green (That one day where Donald Pump decided to pump, but failed). The trend goes into a sharp drop with a rise until lunch where power hour shits on everyone and the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b wins again. All of this shit happened the past week and the previous Thursday and Friday.\n\nIF YOU HAVE NEWS ABOUT THE CORONAVIRUS, POST THAT SHIT HERE.\n\nLittle shits, \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b will win. Bulls, go away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b will smash next week so hard, even the coronavirus will be jelly.", "created_utc": 1582946531, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fb6hzo/post_for_by/", "is_self": true}
