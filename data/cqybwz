{"id": "cqybwz", "title": "LOW (DD): An earnings play", "selftext": "TL;DR: The technicals show the Lowe's will go up on earnings (pre-market next Wednesday). Trade accordingly. \n\n---\n\nThis is purely a technical play. Though even without much knowledge about the fundamentals, the country is thriving economically, and people are building things. There's your DD based on fundamentals. Now for the technicals...\n\nRefer to [this chart](https://imgur.com/a/3BHfj6b) for the following points: \n\n* RSI suggests that Lowe's is over-sold and is due for a price increase\n\n* Look at that ascending channel. I don't even have to draw lines because it's so clear. It's been trading in a nice channel for like 5 years. The channel suggests we will rise in price. \n\n* Look at the 50-day (the blue line). It's bottoming out. The last few times it's bottomed, price has increased 30 points in the following months. \n\n\n\n\n\n[Implied vol](https://imgur.com/a/8Vr71ct) is high. So options are expensive. Those with decent sized accounts can sell puts. \n\nI don't recommend a long term play, but a play of 3 months looks like it would be a winner. Still, in this unpredictable environment, I'm a guy who likes to get in and get out. That's what I'd be doing.", "created_utc": 1565913836, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cqybwz/low_dd_an_earnings_play/", "is_self": true}
