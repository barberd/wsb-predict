Their customer stickey-nes is SUPER high.  They send you flowers when your pet dies for fucks sake.  Once people who are holed up at home, get their 50lb bag of dog food shipped to their house with a hand written note.  They will NEVER leave.  I guarantee you, Chewy posts massive new customer numbers and growth.  THEY CANT EVEN SHIP those bags of fucking 60$/lb Becky dog food fast enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn March 2012, the company estimated a total yearly revenue of $26 million.\n\n2014 to 2015, sales grew from $205 million to $423 million.\n\nAs of 2019 the company was valued at $10.2 billion\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4/17 35$ Calls.  Y'all.  Earnings in April.  \n\n\nOK, maybe comparing them to APRN is a bad idea, but you get the idea. Doggo food delivered home.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1584646180.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flg319/dd_on_chwy_aprn_for_dogs/", "is_self": true}
