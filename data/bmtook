There is no reason to panic over the trade war, **worst case**  a made in China amazon USB cord will cost $5 instead of $4, or a bed bath and beyond WOK will cost $15 instead of $11.99.  That should be chump change.  Most of the China exports are consumer goods anyway.  Price elasticity is a factor, but consumer goods will never cause a financial burden for people. it\u2019s not like the prices of people\u2019s cars or homes will go up and cause an actual recession.\n\nThe country will wake up tomorrow and shit will still be great.  Companies with heavy manufacturing operations in China will get hit *in time* and raise the prices leading to lower sales, but that\u2019s only a long-term and perhaps temporary impact.  Again, it will take a long time to realize the impact of heightened tariffs... and that assumes a deal can\u2019t be worked out (when obviously it can as talks are still occurring).\n\nChina tech companies that don\u2019t operate in the US like BABA / BIDU / etc aren\u2019t going to get hit by a fucking tariff, because they don\u2019t export goods.  Gaming companies with operations in Vegas / Macau won\u2019t get hit either, at least not immediately.  If a slow-drip happens and in a few years China is reeling, then obviously you will see lower numbers there but their country will still function as usual.  \n\nPeople are overreacting to this shit, the main selloff happened Tuesday accounting for negative public sentiment.  buy every subsequent dip... the baby boomers are too ducking stupid to realize this and are going to look like fools for having weak hands because they bought into the doom and gloom  \u201cJoe the beta Financial Planner\u201d spewed to take their money out of the market.", "created_utc": 1557461015, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bmtook/y2k_all_over_again/", "is_self": true}
