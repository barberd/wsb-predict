{"id": "fxlhif", "title": "Reconsidering the bullish case", "selftext": "I know that this is a McDonald's, but I think we should be very clear about what the market is and how we are dealing with it. I lost 3/4 of my portfolio on the bet that the market would collapse again. In retrospect, it wasn't a bad move-- I was simply placed too much as a wager (90% of my portfolio). I am a researcher in economics (specifically tax policy) and have a fair amount of financial knowledge and even I got suckered in.\n\nWe should understand the enemy we are betting with/against:\n\n1. A good proportion of institutional investors and retail investors are in denial about the realistic length of recovery. We know that this proportion is large enough to move the market with low/moderate volume, while the smart money is either cash or holding (meaning large downside potential if they get spooked).\n2. The market does price things in, including deaths and unemployment. The fact that the market plummeted when one person got coronavirus in the US indicated that they priced in the costs of the pandemic. The market does not care how many people are dying *right now*. It cares about when people will go back to work so that companies can buy back stock using company profits.\n\nThe bullish case currently:\n\n1. Markets are irrational and oversensitive to good news -- take advantage of this. Ride the wave. Profit off of the market's stupidity for now.\n2. Countries all over the world are investing in equities again, meaning this isn't a US-centric issue. Everyone wants in while the market is \"cheap.\"\n3. The financial system is flush with cash. The Fed is not directly buying equities. But the government is collaborating with investors, pensions, and everyone else to ensure that there is enough cash for investments. Where does this cash invariably go? It stops defaults and is used to buy stocks. So, brrrr is a real thing-- but JPow is (probably) not buying SeaWorld stock. It is that there is so much liquidity that investors are essentially pressing the \"fuck it\" button and buying SeaWorld. Now, every seller has a buyer. Equity has a genuine demand. Reassess whether this is still true on a weekly basis. Does the market react to negativity or does it seem to shake it off?\n\nWhen do we become bearish?\n\n1. When \"brrrrr\" ceases to matter. What would this entail? I have no answer. What happens when the system is flush with cash at all times where investors are hungry to buy something with extremely cheap money. The market collapsed because everyone wanted to sell and few people wanted to buy. I seriously ask what would do this? Personally, I don't know.\n2. An area becomes reinfected the moment it tries to re-open. This would confirm that the quarantine would last for months more, meaning that stock buybacks, dividends, and other things that give equity inherent value are gone.\n3. The market somehow comes to its senses and buying stagnates at a certain price point below the all-time highs.\n4. Another black swan event comes and gives investors a perfect excuse to abandon their positions.\n\nEven though history might rhyme, we are living in unprecedented times with a government acting in a textbook Keynesian way. That second wave of sell-offs would have probably occurred if the central bank was slow and liquidity was even slightly lacking, but that is speculation.\n\ntl;dr:\n\nIf there is never a significant downturn that is more than 10%, the history books will remember this point as a time when monetary policy successfully prevented a long-term financial crisis. If there is, it will be remembered as the time when the FED had infinite money and still failed. Be skeptical of both narratives because *we simply don't know*.", "created_utc": 1586405081.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxlhif/reconsidering_the_bullish_case/", "is_self": true}
