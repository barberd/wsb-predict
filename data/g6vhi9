{"id": "g6vhi9", "title": "NYCB", "selftext": "New York Community Bank - NYCB - has about $53B AUM with half that in NYC rent-stabilized multifamily commercial mortgages. The rent stabilized tenants are first to be hit by high unemployment. 30% of tenants in USA didn't pay rent in April. Slumlords here in NYC are not too big into the whole cash reserves thing. This, combined with the devastating reform of rent control laws in June, make NYCB look like a big clusterfuck in the mid-term. They have earnings on April 29, I am currently holding bear spread. I can't guarantee that the shit will hit the fan this quarter because we only have one month of missed rent so far, but I feel pretty sure that one of the next 3 quarters is gonna be a biggie. NOTE - big deal - NYCB claims they have a LTV of about 53% across their rent stabilized loans, but these properties are all severely devalued after June rent laws. The numbers haven't caught up yet because there were not that many sales in the meantime.\n\nTL;DR NYCB P $10 5/15\n\nLinks:\n\n30% of tenants missed rent:  [https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/09/business/americans-rent-payment-trnd/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/09/business/americans-rent-payment-trnd/index.html)\n\nNYCB Q4 2019:  [https://s22.q4cdn.com/437978920/files/NYCB-Q4-2019-Earnings-Release.pdf](https://s22.q4cdn.com/437978920/files/NYCB-Q4-2019-Earnings-Release.pdf)", "created_utc": 1587677749.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6vhi9/nycb/", "is_self": true}
