Knowing that AMZN earnings are going to be released in just a few days, I went to googling and found that Amazon's had unprecedented growth in recent months because of beer flu. I don't know anything about options trading, which is precisely why I wanted to trade AMZN options before earnings come out.\n\nI figure that it's gonna go to the moon after earnings come out in 3 days, so I should use my entire 30k worth of life savings to buy AMZN calls, with the strike price being at the current stock price ($2400). What do you fellow autists think? Will post pics of before and after if I'm still alive", "created_utc": 1587474496.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5ewf8/amzn_calls_before_earnings/", "is_self": true}
