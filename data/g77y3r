Not your faults, but nothing is trading logically anymore. \n\nMasterCard earnings came out this morning and were egregious. With analysts not being able to revise their earnings bc of lack of corporate guidance most stocks are missing big. So what are these people using as their expectations? Zero sales? I don\u2019t get how you can get fucked so hard on your quarter and still have the price go up. \n\nI gave in yesterday and bought Visa calls. They\u2019ll probably get a bump from the MA sympathy and increase when their shit earnings come out too. \n\nV $182c 5/22", "created_utc": 1587733206.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g77y3r/ma_shit_earnings_stock_reacts_appropriately_by/", "is_self": true}
