{"id": "dxbdwa", "title": "Correction Lotto Tickets: Shittiest Stock Challenge", "selftext": "This thread is for all the salty bears out there who are just salivating for the end of the melt up. **The challenge is to find the most overvalued stock(s) on the market for the shittiest underlying company.** Some helpful criteria:\n\n1. High price-to-equity ratio \\[This won't work for many unprofitable companies, you can use price-to-sales as a proxy for a bullshit 'growth' stock\\].\n2. High debt-to-EBIDTA \\[Add around 1 to your total for companies with significant [add-backs](https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2019/07/23/1563872966000/Ebitda-add-backs-are-so-hot-right-now/)\\]\n3. Poor credit rating \\[BB all the way down to our CCC's\\]. Even better if the trend is downgrades.\n4. Profits? No, get the fuck outta here. The more cash burn, the better.\n5. Sensitivity to cyclical downturns or unexpected risk in a single sector.\n6. Terrible business model/viable competition.\n7. Insane hype.\n\nWinner gets 10,000 meaningless bonus points and, of course, free tendies for being right.\n\nOur first submission is our good friend **$ROKU**. With shares headed to $160, a price-to-sales ratio of *over 18*, consistent unprofitability, and many viable competitors, our good old pal will probably have serious trouble maintaining its roughly $18.5 billion market cap when waters get a little choppy. The only problem here is that our friend has *no debt*, which is a sad rarity among shit stocks.", "created_utc": 1573932566, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dxbdwa/correction_lotto_tickets_shittiest_stock_challenge/", "is_self": true}
