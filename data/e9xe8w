I don't even know how to trade anymore in these end times?  I guess impeachment talks?  Long $DJT Short $dems I guess? \n\nThese are confusing days man... Are we just gonna rally forever then?  The trade deal is done so is this a forever rally now?  Man. \n\nRight now I just have all my money in SPCE puts anyway so none of this even applies to me anyway but still.  Why SPCE puts you ask?  Well IDK either.  Seemed like a good idea at the time, and here we are a few days later with some worthless puts, maybe lotto tickets?  idk man.  \n\nYou're loved.
