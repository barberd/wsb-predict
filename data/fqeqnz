I work in asset management but this is a good note on what\u2019s been happening in MBS:\n\nBeen in the mortgage industry since 1985. Today will end the craziest week I\u2019ve ever experienced.\n \nHere\u2019s a recap of what\u2019s occurred:\n \nMortgage investors are so spooked out by cities and businesses shutting and the thought of 20% unemployment that they completely abandoned the mortgage market. Mortgage rates went skyrocketing from an all-time low into the mid 4\u2019s in just a few days.\n\nThe Fed said, \u201cdon\u2019t worry\u2026 we will buy all the mortgages like we did in 2008.\u201d Rates then came crashing back down into the low to mid 3\u2019s\u2026.in one incredible day.\n\nFannie and Freddie announced they would allow borrowers to reduce or defer up to 12 mortgage payments with no credit hit. They obviously don\u2019t want a foreclosure or short sale crisis like 2008. Call your mortgage company for details.\nFannie and Freddie acknowledged that appraisers may be freaked out going into stranger\u2019s homes so they made it so they don\u2019t necessarily have to physically inspect the property. They now allow for desktop and drive-by appraisals on some transactions. Mostly owner occupied purchases but some second homes and investment homes too.\n\nThe IRS extended the tax deadline to July 15 but then shut down their offices making tax transcripts very challenging to obtain. Lenders must now use alternatives.\n\nTitle companies tried to slip in a waiver to give themselves an out for virus issues. Lenders said \u201cuh, no,\u201d but provided other ways to protect the collateral.\n\nFannie and Freddie told lenders to start being way more cautious. Confirm employment on, or very near, the day of funding, don\u2019t trust dated documents, make 100% sure the borrower has the ability to repay the loan for the next few years and make sure again at closing. Do not fund loans where you have any doubt even if that means denying loans on closing day.\n\nCongress gave Americans $2 trillion in relief to help get us through the coming weeks or months. \n\nThe jumbo loan market completely melted down. Those loans will be very hard to get going forward and will take way longer to close. Those loans are not backed by the government. Talk to your lender about alternatives.\n\nThe non QM market (bank statement loans and alternative doc loans) completely melted down and those loans have nearly all disappeared going forward. Those loans are not backed by the government.\nNearly every down payment assistance program in the nation was suspended. CalHFA in California was just suspended.\n\nLots of lenders had to make very difficult decline calls to crying borrowers this week\u2026some who were at the closing table ready to sign. Just awful.\n\nFHA and VA loans are struggling for survival. They will make it but with massive changes. Some lenders shut them down. Some Lenders raised credit scores and raised interest rates to limit risk. Congress may need to step in and rumor is they will. \n\nMost lenders raised they credit rating requirement to 640+.\n\nNot all lenders will make it through this. Some may not make it through next week. Quicken, the nation\u2019s biggest lender, is rumored to have alerted the government that they may need help to survive.\n \nLet\u2019s hope next week is way less eventful, and less stressful, than this one.\n\nHang in there. Be patient. Make take a few months but there\u2019s light at the end of this tunnel.\n\n\nTL;DR: By popular demand... the residential mortgage industry is basically declaring broke people toxic. Don\u2019t be an idiot and short residential real estate, puts on commercial real estate.", "created_utc": 1585376278.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqeqnz/note_on_the_dislocation_in_the_mortgage_backed/", "is_self": true}
