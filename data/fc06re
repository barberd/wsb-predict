They are also usually older people.\n\nDavita makes its money by performing dialysis chronically for patients, fewer patients = less revenue.  It has had a 35% increase in its share price over the last year.\n\nIf it loses 8-10% of patients this year and possibly next year earnings will definitely take a hit.\n\nTLDR: DVA 67.5p 4/17 and 7/17\nFresenius is also a possibility but puts are more expensive and it\u2019s business is more diversified in dialysis equipment manufacturing.\n\nWould post screenshot but order was just placed so it\u2019s not in effect yet", "created_utc": 1583094925, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fc06re/dialysis_industry_at_risk_from_coronavirus/", "is_self": true}
