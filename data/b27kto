The Good Friday Agreement which ended most of the hostilities in North Ireland of the 1900s, or arguably longer, guarantees that their can never be a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. It also ensures that Northern Ireland will remain British unless a popular referendum of the predominantly loyalist population changes this to reunite with Ireland. If Britain goes through with Brexit the EU requires a hard border between Britain and the EU, which would be the Northern Irish border, bringing the foundation of the GFA into question. Additionally, old tensions between Irish Nationalists and Loyalists are rising with the importance of the DUP (unionist party) in the British Parliament\u2019s majority alliance and the recent announcement that a British soldier will be tried for his role in the Bloody Sunday murders. (Source for new tensions: lurking on r/ireland)\n\nOverall, I could see Brexit working out three ways for Northern Ireland\u2019s economy:\n\n1. Britain could decide to cede Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland and go through with brexit without them. This is definitely the least likely scenario and would only occur if Britain really wanted to leave and couldn\u2019t negotiate a way to do so with NI. The changes required to NI businesses would cause a lot of restructuring and uncertainty causing short term losses. Long term, it would probably benefit the companies to remain in the EU.\n\n2. Britain gives up on Brexit. Not unlikely, but would have to come about with a change in the political leadership of the country to the left which could also cause short term losses. Again, it is probably beneficial long term for the companies to remain in the EU. Losses would be due to the political changes or contested elections and not due to staying in the EU.\n\n3. They could not make a decision for a long time, or worst case (for them) go through with brexit while keeping NI which would cause a tremendous amount of political and social tension and upheaval. Either of these options would increase uncertainty and exacerbate current problems. Companies would obviously be hurt in any political debates that came up regarding the future of the GFA and NI.\n\nDisclaimers:\nI am not Irish or British\nI am not a good investor\nI was not sober when I wrote this", "created_utc": 1552843786, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b27kto/st_paddys_dd_leverage_your_ira_to_support_the/", "is_self": true}
