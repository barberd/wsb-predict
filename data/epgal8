{"id": "epgal8", "title": "Long CSCO Short HD", "selftext": "This trade is based on CSCO:HD ratio ready to go up. Does it necessarily mean HD will go down? Not exactly, but CSCO will at least go up more than HD. If you want play this with options, you can try long CSCO calls and short HD calls. There are many ways to trade long short, and I think I will employ more of these trades since the broad market is somewhat extended. I am personally long CSCO and short HD with a ratio of 6 to 4.", "created_utc": 1579161246, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/epgal8/long_csco_short_hd/", "is_self": true}
