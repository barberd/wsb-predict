{"id": "c8dc4u", "title": "Golf stocks?", "selftext": "I love to golf, but I've never owned golf stocks because they're not exciting. Until now. Take Callaway (ELY) for example. Jana (a highly-successful activist hedge fund) recently disclosed a 9.5% stake in Callaway, saying that its undervalued and they plan to discuss strategic initiatives. I'm not surprised by this position for a number of reasons:\n\n\\- Golf participation and interest has increased YoY since the first time in 2003 according to a recent study. Further, the National Golf Federation estimated that 2.6 million beginners played for the first time last year, which is a historic high. I am an avid golfer and I can see it happening.\n\n\\- Callaway also owns a 14% stake in Top Golf, which is growing rapidly. Top Golf is super-fun and is transforming the sport a bit to make it accessible for people who are otherwise disinterested in traditional golf. Not to mention that its valued as high as $6B (ELY has a market cap of $1.62B).\n\n\\- From a technical perspective, ELY is 29% off its 52 week high, and looking back to their August earnings report last year, they experienced a 15% pop immediately after and a further 10% run up after an earnings blowout.\n\nELY looks like its settling out after some recent profit-taking from the Jana announcement and I think its poised for a nice run up to earnings. What do you guys think? What am I missing?", "created_utc": 1562094511, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c8dc4u/golf_stocks/", "is_self": true}
