{"id": "bbbo5t", "title": "$CHGG DD BULLISH", "selftext": "Chegg recently served copyright claims to textsheet and litanswers, two sites that were stealing their answers and giving them away for free. Since they shut these sites down I\u2019ve noticed more people in my school using chegg. Clearly my isolated experience applies nationwide meaning that cheggs user base has prob grown by at least 10%. On top of this their recent dip makes it a good time to buy, their earnings call on the 29th will show this is true. Options on chegg are low volume but I think the stock will rose by 10-15% by the end of April so maybe just holding to the stock is enough.
