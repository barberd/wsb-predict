I did exactly what the comment did. I downloaded robinhood and selected 5K even though my bank account didn\u2019t have it. It went through amazingly!!! I was negative 5K on BOA and the money was on  my robinhood. \n\nI invested in AMD and selected random stocks to invest in based on upvoted comments. In just two week I made 400$. Don\u2019t forget robinhood gold. It increased my gains. So I had 10k to play with. I made 10,400 bucks. Transferred it back to my account and I was 425$ in profit. I did all of this while playing XBL. I can\u2019t wait to play with 200K", "created_utc": 1557511620, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bn1lzp/thank_you/", "is_self": true}
