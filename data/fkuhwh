{"id": "fkuhwh", "title": "GameStop is totally screwed", "selftext": "If you haven't noticed, non-critical businesses are closing their doors, sometimes by choice and sometimes by force.  Unfortunately for sweaty neckbeards, GameStop is not a critical business and will soon be forced to shut.\n\nQuarantines are already causing record numbers of people to play videogames, but GameStop is unlikely to benefit due to their business model.  While you can get new releases shipped to you from GameStop, you can get them from any other online store too.  Vintage and used games are sold for a hefty markup in store, but they do not have an efficient method of ordering them online to be delivered. On top of that many services are offering old titles for download, like on the Switch.\n\nWhen you look at the month for GameStop, they are down only 12%, and the week, only 4%.  Now look at the year: -70%.  They were screwed long before Coronavirus but it will be the death of them, with Reggie or not.\n\nTldr GME 4/17 $3.5P and 1/15/21 $1P (they goin bankrupt)", "created_utc": 1584556276.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkuhwh/gamestop_is_totally_screwed/", "is_self": true}
