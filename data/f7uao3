This poor, autistic man let his full retard shine at the peak of bitcoin in 2017.", "selftext": "Many moons ago, there i was. Sitting at my desk in a room with 3 other guys. We were the IT helpdesk team for a small company. While im not going to give you their real names, i will however tell you the nick names we came up for each other. Yes, these are the real names we came up with. There was Juicy J, Helpdesk manager. Semen Boner, Helpdesk analyst. Jam Jam, another analyst who actually became my best friend even after he left the company. And last but most definitely least, Kendoll, me. \n\nIf you dont know, being stuck in a room with 3 other autist for 8 hours a day does something to you. Its like your brainwaves collide with each other and sync up and vibrate on the same spectrum. Its quite magical. \n\nIn our down time we like to research ways to make hella bands over night so we wouldn\u2019t have to go to work the next day. Well one day semen called out to us and asked \u201cyou guys ever here of this cryptocurrency shit\u201d. None of us have, so he went on to tell the mystical tale of bitcoin and other alt coins. He told of stories of massive gains and even this new program called bitconnect that got all the gains for you. \n\nWe excitedly and quickly signed up for a trading platform. We used coinbase and binance. With dollar signs in our eyes, we started blindly buying any coin with promising returns... or, well all of them. There were times when we gathered and held arms together in a circle and chanted \u201cTO THE MOON! TO THE MOON!...\u201dThere were also times where our autistic waves combined to craft some never before seen form of retardation. I can tell all the tales, the pump n dumps, the bitconnect, but lets stick with the grand daddy moment. \n\nFast forward to December. Bitcoin is 19k. Prior to hitting 19k i poured my entire savings (just $1500) into many different alt coins. I remember the night i hit my peak. My savings account almost tripled to $3,000+. This was the peak of my entire life. Never have i imagined jacking off to such massive gains. I was in a world of pure bliss. But did i sell at this point? No. I was in the clouds, but i was shooting for the moon. I figured ill make another 10k or so and hop out. \n\nThe next day at work we all told the tale of our gains over night. Myself, semen, and jam jam were giggling and showing off our accounts. Juicy J was sitting in silence, contemplating. I asked him, whats on his mind. He said he got approved for a $10,000 credit card and hes thinking about running the whole thing to buy alt coins. We all looked at him and gave him the look of respect. I remember thinking \u201cGoddamn. This is a move beyond my comprehension. I am nowhere near as skilled as the great Juicy J\u201d\n\nWe gave him the \u201cto the moon chant\u201d and told him things about how you gotta take risks for success, whip the balls out, etc. Whether we influenced him or not, i dont know. But he did it. He purchased a huge variety of alt coins. 10k worth. We were quite impressed. Especially bc this dude has a wife and trying to have a baby. \n\nWell, bitcoin crashed. His 10k turned to less than a thousand. A completely worthless portfolio backed by a maxed out credit card with 24% APR, meaning his interest gets him at around $200 a month. \n\nJuicy J was crushed. He hid it well on the outside but i could detect a poor, broken soul on the inside. His demeanor definitely changed the rest of the time he worked with us. My guess is his wife probably beat him every night after that once she found out. \n\nI still talk to him. To this day hes still paying off the credit card. He got about 20% paid off right now. Hes been denied personal loans for other reasons. So hes still pretty fucked. Oh yea, and he did end up having a child so theres that as well. My hat goes off to you Juicy J. Your a brave man with biggest steel balls ive ever seen in my life. Mad respect my autistic brother. \n\nI figured you fellow autist would enjoy this story.", "created_utc": 1582386863, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7uao3/gather_around_while_i_share_with_you_a_story_of_a/", "is_self": true}
