However, I know that there has to be a couple non-autistic people lurking this sub that might be able to point me into a good direction for DD and websites I can use to help me more with options. \n\nHit me with your best shot.", "created_utc": 1564769742, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cl7s1i/real_question_for_those_who_dont_have_stage_iv/", "is_self": true}
