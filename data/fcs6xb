Now remdisivir will be available at 3 major hospitals in Korea. Previously they've been applying symptomatic therapy for patients with mild symptoms and prescribing Kaletra (HIV drug) for those with more severe symptoms.\n\nI don't personally have any positions in Gilead myself, but if stage 3 clinical trial results come in strong, it looks like Gilead make $$$.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Stage 3 clinical trial was approved in 4 days, not 9 days, after Gilead applies. So, clinical trial results may come in sooner than expected.", "created_utc": 1583227967.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcs6xb/remdisivir_approved_for_stage_3_clinical_trial_in/", "is_self": true}
