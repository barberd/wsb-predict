Going short DUST is one way to play even though it has fallen a lot since April.  I stayed away back then from the options b/c of the crazy premiums but at prices in the 20s they are more reasonable although b/c it is a leveraged etf the IV is still relatively high.\n\nThe JNUG bulls got their lunch eaten back then too - it has since gone through a reverse split.  As for me I have been playing it safe with GDX stock (not options).  Avg cost basis is around $29  - saw a big drawdown when it hit the high teens but it has since reversed and gone back up.  Buying GDX calls also seems safer.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-XskdObsFA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-XskdObsFA) I know this is not a junior gold miner but Barrick Gold CEO saying in the first 1 minute that b/c they are in Africa the company is already used to dealing with viral pandemics (Ebola mostly).  Smaller gold companies may not have the resources or lending connections for gold.\n\nThe fundamentals of gold seem strong given that all central banks are on massive printing sprees.  In dollar terms gold failed to break the $2k ceiling b/c of oversupply in the past (listen to the Barrick CEO who covered this issue).  I am very bullish on gold but want to stay away from GLD b/c of longstanding issues on its physical delivery.  \n\nTLDR: Long GDX - looking to add different ways into my position via options.", "created_utc": 1588885704.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gff9dm/shorting_the_inverse_gold_miner_etfs/", "is_self": true}
