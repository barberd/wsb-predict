{"id": "gzdsb9", "title": "TSLA 6/19 200p Challenge", "selftext": "So like many others, I YOLO'd into Covid, starting with a 10k portfolio (down 40k) on 2/24 with 10 UAL 4/17 70p's at 2.38, sold 2/27 for 10.30 per, and continuing to roll through hundreds of trades (GE, GM, INDA, SEAS, TSLA, BRZU, LVS, SYF, CAKE, COF etc.) to 3/19, reaching a peak return of \\~189k from a low in Feb (took out about 30k, so a total gain of 172k), or 19 trading days. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mtz0k2xhms351.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=71ee2441f89eeebc6c96cf12f9ba6e89d49c2214\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/337469zyks351.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=6022377f5b93bde8a18f0feab41793051cf1c30c\n\nBetween averaging down and diamond hands, I would end up holding the entire balance in TSLA 6/19 200p's, losing money on UUP calls (shoutout SV), BYND puts, and UBER puts along the way to rock bottom. With diamond hands and several dip purchases I held the 6/19 200p's through TSLA earnings at which point the original cost on 3/19 of \\~$23 were sold off entirely at .75 per on 4/30. Some time with tanker gang, theta gang, and using and losing the stimulus check to buy a 6/19 WING $125p would bring it down further to a new rock bottom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8dlondmcls351.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=aca7832c0edffe7488c22e0cf14d972d9651db23\n\nRather than loathe myself for the rest of my life and regret not purchasing multiple discounted properties across Europe or SHOP calls and retire but remaining convinced the 2nd leg down was coming and that TSLA was due to revisit the Oct 2019 lows on poor guidance and a 2nd wave of CV and peak deaths and fully committed to bear gang, I'm going to attempt to climb my way back out, and get back to the high high's by TSLA 6/19 200p expiry. And as long as REITs and bankrupt companies are going up 20%-50% per day and printer goes brrr (my roth was similarly devastated by TSLA 6/19 200p's, but I do hold a single NKLA share, so), there seems no better time to go full YOLO and fight for what's right - J Powell to be nominated Time Man of the Year (somehow there are no odds listed for either J Powell or George Floyd but odds for BoJo) and win YOLO hearts and minds with reckless short expiry OTM calls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5udfka77ms351.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d8d0275eddeeb6ae7b850d5fedcbc32ecc157d2\n\nTo get there, I need to average approximately 40% daily returns each day from here to 6/19 - today was an 88% day, so I'm well ahead of progress - tough going against the PDT limits, but should clear that hurdle this week. Will post trades and update when I've lost everything and maxed out my CCs to double down and lost those too.\n\nTldr - loss porn, am retard, will attempt to yolo my way back by 6/19, TSLA 6/19 200p Challenge", "created_utc": 1591668779.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gzdsb9/tsla_619_200p_challenge/", "is_self": true}
