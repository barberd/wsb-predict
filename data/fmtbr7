And its still getting worse.\n\nWell, I have a solution to minimize the impact on yourself, and ensure that you are still here in a few months to make tendies:\n\n**Get the virus now.**\n\n***Hear me out,***\n\n\\-The biggest issue we currently face is that a finite number of equipment exists to support critical cases of COVID-19. At current rates, critical cases will outnumber availability in just a couple weeks (or less).\n\n\\-Italy experienced a healthcare system collapse, leaving people unable to get the help they needed, and essentially forcing providers to chooses who lives and dies. This is clearly shitty.\n\n\\-Most young people have mild symptoms, but there is still a possibility of your immune system essentially killing you (cytokine storm).\n\n\\-It is unconfirmed, but most likely the case that after recovery, you will have antibodies giving you solid (short term at minimum) immunity. You can go back to living as if it didn't happen. Wanna lick the subway pole or an escalator rail? Go ahead.\n\n\\-If you die from it now, you probably would have died from it in even shittier circumstances shortly down the road.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, huge 4D chess lifehack: get it over with before shit really hits the fan and you and your loved ones die suffering without proper medical care. Put premiums may be pretty low when everyone else is a corpse of lung-hacking vegetable.\n\n**TL;DR: Get the coronavirus now, recover before the healthcare system collapses, and reap the rewards of (probable) immunity while others die in the street.**\n\n[https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/20/819038431/do-you-get-immunity-after-recovering-from-a-case-of-coronavirus](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/20/819038431/do-you-get-immunity-after-recovering-from-a-case-of-coronavirus)\n\nEdit: Read the fucking flair pls, thank you.
