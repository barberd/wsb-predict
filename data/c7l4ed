Bought my first call option for SPY - 295.5 with 7/5 expiration at $1.18 at like 3:50pm Friday. \n\nDo I sell these puppies at open? Do I wait for some action Monday morning? What\u2019re you goons doing to lose as much $$ as possible with your calls tomorrow morning?\n\nIf anyone cares I also have some AMD options with 7/5 expiration at a 31.5 strike. Am I going to the moon here? This was option #2 cuz YOLO and that Lindsey Lohan White shit had me rambunctious.", "created_utc": 1561937044, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c7l4ed/spy_autists_sell_at_open/", "is_self": true}
