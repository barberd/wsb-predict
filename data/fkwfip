I had followed WSB for the past few months, but wanted to be responsible with the money. So I bought 100 shares of AMC at $7.05 (now trading at $2.47). After trading hours I started reading up on this thing called the coronavirus and found  evidence from highly reputable scientists about this causing a global pandemic.\n\nMany people on another forum I read started thinking this virus would cause a global recession and that it would adversely affect the travel, tourism, restaurant and entertainment industries. I found the scientific research credible and thought the conclusions of these posters logical. Someone on that forum had a large position in $RCL and I decided to sell my $AMC shares and follow his lead. I put the entire 1k into $RCL 80p when it was trading at $91. That day I made more than 60% profit and sold my position. It was an incredible rush and I felt ecstatic! I took a week off trading but continued reading up on the coronavirus. \n\nI eventually decided to buy $SPY 240p when it was trading at $310 and quickly sold those puts for 50% profit. Once again the rush I felt was incredible. I currently have $1100 cash and $4200 worth of options in the account. I've certainly sold too early at times, but I've still made an absolute killing!\n\nOne might assume that I've had a terrific time, and I have, but I can't overstate how much stress this experience has caused me. There's been plenty of days where my unrealized profits drop by $500 and I feel absolutely dreadful, countless nights of waking up at 3 am to check the futures, and my heart rate is through the roof every weekday 9-4. I simply don't think I can take this anymore. If this is what making money trading options feels like (for me) then I can't imagine how losing money feels. It's worth noting that I have Bipolar Disorder 2 and am much more sensitive to positive and negative emotions than the average person.\n\nFriday will be my last day trading, no matter what happens. I will sell off all my positions (except for a couple EEM puts that have a market value of $660) and try to avoid this subreddit. I would like to thank every single one of you for your information, camaraderie, and exquisite sense of humour. You've truly brightened my past few weeks, but my mental health is more important to me than money. \n\nIf you're struggling with mental health or gambling issues, I'm here for you.", "created_utc": 1584562959.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkwfip/i_dont_have_the_stomach_for_this/", "is_self": true}
