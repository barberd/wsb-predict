{"id": "ewi94k", "title": "darkhorse short of the day: DXJ (Japan etf)", "selftext": "I've been looking at a lot of charts for the DXJ.  There are cracks starting to appear in this etf.  It's tightly tracking the FXI, but DXJ is actually highly priced compared to the FXI because of the massive selldown in the FXI (China).  The Nikkei is up 1% now.  I plan to short DXJ in the morning.  This is only for gamblers.  \n\nI am bullish NFLX, AMZN, GLD, GBTC (bitcoin).  NFLX (people are going to watch shows and not travel).  AMZN (people aren't going to shops with the virus out there).", "created_utc": 1580442249, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ewi94k/darkhorse_short_of_the_day_dxj_japan_etf/", "is_self": true}
