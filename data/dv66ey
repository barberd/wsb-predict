[$3000 PROFIT!!]", "selftext": "THIS IS NOT ILLEGAL AS I AM NOT ENCOURaging YOU TO CAUSE SERIOUS DEBT YOU CANNOT PAY OFF TO YOUR BROKER. 5,000 is not serious debt, you will have that money at some time so you are not scamming the broker (RH). you are just hoping u get the unsettled funds (5k) sooner than later and u were trying to pay the whole time (good faith LAW)  \n\nthe cancelled deposit from TD Bank is the $4,600 I borrowed: https://i.imgur.com/lPMnSVI.png ($2000 profit)\n\nanother picture from yesterday too: https://i.imgur.com/0kJslxT.png ($1000 profit)\n\nproof I borrowed money as robinhood graph for day is fucked up: https://i.imgur.com/6eeCqOV.png\n\n\u200b\n\nHERE IS WHAT GRAPH SHUD LOOK LIKE: https://i.imgur.com/syiWYGE.png\n\n\u200b\n\nfor some reason the week one is the only one that shows right. the day shows as if i lost $4,600 today from cancelling my 4600 deposit into robinhood.\n\nTLDR: ~~Yesterday and today~~ (awhile ago) I deposited (TD bank to RH) $4,600 into robinhood. Robinhood gives me $4,600 instant deposit which I use to buy Uber puts and make $3,000 total yesterday and today. I refund $4,600 instant money by cancelling the deposit to transfer money from my bank to robinhood. Honestly thought my homies were gonna send me $4,600 that day but they didn\u2019t. They flip flopped about sending me money which is the only reason i did this in the first place with unsettled funds. When I realized my homies were liars, I cancelled and felt bad RH helped me get $3000 free money I didn\u2019t really earn myself", "created_utc": 1573540634, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dv66ey/robinhood_5000_free_money_glitch_not_illegal_3000/", "is_self": true}
