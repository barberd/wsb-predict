I've now switched to a short position. I'm no expert, but my hunch is that this is a sort of mass hysteria. \n\nAs far as car manufacturers go, their market cap is second only to Toyota. This seems absurd to me. I get it though, they're a tech company. They have a great public perception and a massive head start on a charging network. \n\nI don't think their self-driving AI is *that* advanced though. And if data is the issue, any big manufacturer can easily equip their new models with cameras and collect way more data real fast.\n\nI say all of this as a huge Tesla fan. And if I make tindys on this I'll probably use it to pay off my Cybertruck. Good luck out there.", "created_utc": 1580467165, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ewmmvz/bank_of_america_on_tesla/", "is_self": true}
