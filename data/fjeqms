Long term I\u2019d suspect success but thats like forever forever and fast money is really the only money on this sub.\n\nI know what your thinking, \u201cvaccines take at least a year\u201d and that your right ... under normal circumstances.\n\nIf Beer Flu 2019 is following the due course of panic and its log plots, it may come to level for which:\n\n1) The FDA has the ability/need to expedite the vaccine timelines, although how much is questionable\n\n2) There will be a patient base for which vaccines can be tested (unlike the lack of SARS patients that invalidated attempt to trial the slowly-developed SARS Vax)\n\n\nThere a lot of companies, many with tried and true reputations that are eyeing a vaccine that:\n\n1) will be bought by a vast majority of the US and international public\n\n2) will be bought, continuously, for the US Gov Stockpile\n\nBut even though only one is likely to succeed fully, I\u2019m guessing that getting anywhere close in this race will bump up prices before a swift payday.\n\nNo doubt generally market shifts will mess with it but 2-3 months from now, thoughts on:\n\nMRNA  $50   5/1\n\nCould be too autistic lmk\n\nTL;DR:\n\nIf Beer Flu gets bad, FDA will open glorious biotech vax floodgates and Tendies will flow.", "created_utc": 1584331254.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjeqms/long_beer_flu_vaccine_modernainovio/", "is_self": true}
