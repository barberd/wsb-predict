A ton of brand new Chanel, Gucci, LV, etc bags being sold in troves. Why? Because BLM klan went out there in early June to clear out those shelves via forced entry. EBay is the one platform that all these retards went to sell their stolen goods off at high prices. The same goes for Nike products and along of Footwear brands. These idiots practically stole whatever they could and most of these things aren\u2019t in their right sizes so it becomes more $$$ to sell via EBay. EBay is going to report some fat ass guidance!", "created_utc": 1593363665.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hhhxtp/ebay_calls/", "is_self": true}
