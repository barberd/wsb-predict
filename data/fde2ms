{"id": "fde2ms", "title": "AEO - American Eagle Puts DD", "selftext": "It might be too late to post this due to Urban outfitters moving down, but since 2012  AEO has moved down 5 out of 7 Q4 earnings with an average move of 8.02%,  and although past movements don't guarantee future movements the odds seem to be in favor of puts. since to odds of success are about 71% I placed 71% of my Robinhood cash in $12 3/6 puts at an average price of .3. Also out of 28 quarters, they've moved down on 19  quarters with an average move of 7.7% or inverse this and buy calls.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/an21hbun5ok41.png?width=658&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9a1783cffc8273a7ecc6145fb00ad8c125c97c5", "created_utc": 1583333526, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fde2ms/aeo_american_eagle_puts_dd/", "is_self": true}
