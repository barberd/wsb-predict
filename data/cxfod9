Cameramen forget which channel they are on and leave space for graphics and then zoom around like retards to fix it.

The top news thing on the right breaks down and stays broken for like 5 mins. It's like they don't have enough money or some shit\n\nThe guys who animate their ads like the ETF stuff are way too good for what they are doing though", "created_utc": 1567164895, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cxfod9/bloomberg_tv_is_too_embarrassing_to_watch/", "is_self": true}
