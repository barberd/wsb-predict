Maybe half of you Cracker Jacks in this sub have seen 1, and you snowflakes won\u2019t shut the fuck up about  how it was almost like the Great Depression.  Well I\u2019ve got news for ya, Daddy-O, IT WASN\u2019T!\n\nYou think you\u2019re hot shit driving your Terslas, bumping Yeezy, owning SPCE calls, dabbing a vape.  My wife has a big butt too, like you kids these days like \u2018em, but that\u2019s the only thing I can find in common with you punks.\n\nOh I\u2019m gonna have so much fun sitting in my recliner, smokes rolled up in my sleeve, hair slicked back like we did it in the early \u201860s, watching all you Johnny-come-latelies fall for the dead cat bounce that we\u2019ll be seeing soon, right before the next cliff dive.  It happens every time just like this, with the inverted yield curve, copper prices, euphoria, but we still get you kids\u2019 money every damn time, don\u2019t we??? Heh heh.  Stealing from our own grandkids :)  Oh look at me, I\u2019m a millenial in a gang and we call ourselves Theta, and think we\u2019re market makers YOLO!\n\nTime for my prunes and nap.  Do your DD, see you at S&amp;P 1900, and stay the fuck off my lawn!!", "created_utc": 1582803498, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/faatrt/fwd_ok_millenial/", "is_self": true}
