For the truly special people in the room (I know their is one of you), when an iPhone sends a text to another iPhone, the sender's text is blue.  When an iPhone sends to a non-iPhone, *the sender's text is green.*  Now I knew the kids were sensitive to this, just like they're all triggered by the site of cracked class (Remember when Cybertruck first debuted and $TSLA DIPPED the next day?).  My Gen-Z GF was actually furious about this when I tried an android phone last year.    \n    \nBut I had no idea EVERYONE was this indoctrinated.  Even 40-somethings who probably couldn't set up an Instagram account if they're life depended on it know that \"green text bad, blue good\".  \n    \nThere is no fighting Tim Apple.  400 by 2021.", "created_utc": 1578325817, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ekvux9/also_shitpost_a_little_aapl_made_green_the_color/", "is_self": true}
