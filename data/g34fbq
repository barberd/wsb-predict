{"id": "g34fbq", "title": "DD - OXY in trouble", "selftext": "Occidental Petroleum has been in trouble since buying Anadarko for $57bn.\n\nThe board structured the purchase specifically to avoid a shareholders vote. This required an outside financier (Warren Buffet) to loan OXY the billions necessary for the purchase. He wrote himself a hell of a deal which the board agreed to - 8% premium dividends, payable by cash or equity.\n\nThe bill is coming due for OXY, and they are so strapped for cash with oil crashing that they're paying Buffet back by issuing new shares, diluting the value of existing holders. OXY is also paying a premium for paying his dividend in shares rather than cash [Barrons](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.barrons.com/amp/articles/occidental-petroleum-would-pay-a-bonus-if-dividend-payments-to-warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-are-in-stock-51586179749)\n\nRevised: ~~Buffet has signaled he may sell the shares off.~~ poor source. \n\nOXY still has several billion dollars in bonds outstanding and coming due this summer and near zero cash flow. The equity values are dependent on oil being $50/barrel. The risks on puts are acquisition (unlikely when the other major players are also hurting) or government subsidies, which are unlikely as congress is in recess and the House will be obstinate after Trump bypassed the oversight in the first bailout.\n\nIf oil stays below the $20 mark, I see OXY going to $5 by end of May.\n\nDisclaimer - I have put open through August on OXY for the above reasons.\n\n[Positions](https://i.imgur.com/CPYCOnW.png)", "created_utc": 1587138164.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g34fbq/dd_oxy_in_trouble/", "is_self": true}
