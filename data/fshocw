{"id": "fshocw", "title": "Emotional and Financial toll from this virus may take years to normalize", "selftext": "Fellow geniuses, let me guide you through what many will consider a totally inept analysis of the virus impact.\n\nFirst, I am not a \"permabear\" despite many bearish posts and comments. However, I was already bearish prior to this virus, thinking the party had gone on too long and we needed a correction. It would be nice for   people not to lose money, and everything be great, however I am a realist.\n\n*TL;DR: This virus is here for awhile and that will impact consumer behavior longer than just a few months. Even with a cure or vaccine, the emotional toll of having to deal with the seasonal flu, plus coronavirus, could take years to normalize. The economic impact will be substantial.*\n\n**'This virus is going to be with us'**\n\n>I'm hopeful that we'll get through  this *first wave* and, and have some time to prepare for the *second wave*.  I'm hopeful that the private sector in its ingenuity and working with the government, NIH, will develop a vaccine that ultimately will change the impact of this virus. \n\n>But for the next ***24 months***, you know, we're all in this together, and the most important thing  that we can do  is twofold: the American public fully embracing the  social distancing that we requested to protect the vulnerable; and secondly, to operationalize the bread and butter of public health, you know, early case identification, isolation, contact tracing, so that this outbreak does not get the upper hand, as it has, unfortunately, in New York City, in northern New Jersey, and now New Orleans.- CDC  Director\n\n[CDC Director - This Virus Will Be With Us](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/31/824155179/cdc-director-on-models-for-the-months-to-come-this-virus-is-going-to-be-with-us)\n\nThis is not going away after the first wave. We will have a second wave,  and  most likely another after that. We all know the flu by itself kills tens of thousands annually, even with a vaccine available for years.\n\nPeople are used to the Flu, it has been with us for a long time. But it still kills many people worldwide each year. Now, imagine adding a new virus that we are all scared of to every flu season. If you did not get it   during the first wave, you probably don't want to get it in the second or third. *This fear will greatly impact many people's behavior*. How they travel, spend, etc, and this will impact the economy for an extended length of time.\n\n**One in three Americans say a household member has been laid off or had their pay cut**\n\n>Fully a third of Americans have someone in their household who\u2019s been  laid off or lost pay. The economic and humanitarian damage here is    incredibly widespread, even more than the unemployment claims data suggests. \n\n>The Google Trends data  is especially alarming right now, because searches for \u201cfile for unemployment\u201d are far, far higher than they were in the depths of the  Great Recession.\n\n>Two economists, the University of Minnesota\u2019s Aaron Sojourner and Yale\u2019s Paul Goldsmith-Pinkham, have [built a model for predicting unemployment claims](https://www.epi.org/blog/coronavirus-record-breaking-spike-in-ui-claims/) based on news reports. Their [initial model](https://www.epi.org/blog/coronavirus-record-breaking-spike-in-ui-claims/) nearly nailed the 3.3 million number, predicting 3.4 million new claims. They [now project 4.7 million new claims](https://twitter.com/paulgp/status/1243204614125649924) for the week ending March 27, a huge spike from an already record number.\n\n[Vox - Economic Number](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/3/30/21184401/coronavirus-covid-19-economy-charts)\n\nEven with government checks and recovery money, many of these companies and jobs won't come back. Weak businesses, the small mom and pop types, who  were already struggling, won't make it through this. *Unemployment will remain elevated longer than some anticipate.*\n\nWe had already seen a shift to many people working for themselves, also known as the gig economy. Many of these people are either already unemployed or will remain underemployed for months, if not years. This   includes everyone from subcontractors, to your self employed business owners.\n\nMultiple articles have popped up about different industries that are seeing an impact. Here are a few  mentioned recently:\n\n* Ridesharing (Uber, Lift, Scooters, Bikes)\n* Restaurants (Chains, Bars, mom and pop, food trucks)\n* Wedding Industry (Venues, Caterers, Photographers, Florists)\n* Gambling (Casinos, Online, Vegas)\n* Sports (Local indoor fields, gyms, rinks, youth sports, local leagues, races)\n* Travel (Hotels, Airbnb, Airlines, Airports, Planners, Cruises, Tours, Cities)\n* Oil (Certain States, companies, WTI)\n* Retail (Malls, Local Independent Stores, some chains)\n* Motion Picture (Studios, Labor, Theater)\n* Home Services (Landscapers, Small Construction, Builders)\n* Personal Services (Barbers, Spas, Salons, Pet Care, Child Care, Nannies, Home Health Aids)\n* Real Estate (2nd homes, Rentals, Realtors)\n* Music & Arts (Concerts, Galleries, Venues)\n* Auto (local dealers, new cars, big 3)\n\n**34% GDP Plunge**\n\n>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. expects the U.S. economy to experience a far deeper slump than previously anticipated as the coronavirus pandemic hammers  businesses, causing a wave of mass unemployment.\n\n>The  world\u2019s largest  economy will shrink an annualized ***34%***   in the second  quarter, compared with an earlier estimate of 24%, economists led by Jan Hatzius wrote in a report. Unemployment will soar to *15%* by mid-year, up from a  previous forecast of 9%, they wrote.\n\n>The economists, however, now expect a  stronger recovery in the third quarter, with gross domestic product  expanding 19%.\u201cOur estimates imply that a bit more than half of the  near-term output  decline is made up by year-end,\u201d they wrote. While  there\u2019s a risk of   longer-term fallout on income and spending, the  aggressive action by the Federal Reserve and the government should  help to contain this.\n\n[Goldman Sees Deeper Plunge](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sees-even-deeper-u-080522193.html)\n\n34% is just a massive impact. They do expect a strong recovery (as do  many)  but it still won't immediately make up for the total hit we will  take. One can't help but wonder how much of this won't go away, and how  long  it will take to get back on track.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWe will get out of this and life will return to normal. However, those calling bottoms, and talking V shape recovery in only a month or so may be shortsighted. People will spend less going forward, impacting all   areas of the economy. The emotional and financial toll of this virus may take years to fully normalize.\n\nPosition: Overall outlook for the next few months or so is bearish, despite the irrational exuberance of the bulls this past week.\n\n*Disclaimer: This is just a random opinion from some average guy locked in his house drinking copious amounts of coffee. Do your own DD and form your own  opinion.*\n\n*I did not dig into lots of other areas in this post. Other things to look at or consider; EM, China data, Oil, Europe, Debt, Future World  Virus  Spread, etc..*", "created_utc": 1585677379.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fshocw/emotional_and_financial_toll_from_this_virus_may/", "is_self": true}
