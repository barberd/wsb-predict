I just bought them yesterday morning and some this morning and im up a little thus far.  Everyone keeps saying \"they're gonna expire worthless\" and \"its an awful bet\"  but theyre drastically outpacing every analyst estimates, the overall market, and generally straight up with no pullbacks.  The past couple days its showed weakness, and I expect profit taking going into the New year.  \n\nId like to say I am long term Bullish obviously, Im just in this for the pullback.  Should they fall close to their respective support areas, I will go long then.  I am hoping for a pullback going into ER and to collect the Premium then dump it all before ER.  The only way I dont sell into ER is if they have only slightly pulled back and its not at a floor.  I find it highly unlilely they wont experience a significant pullback based on previous chart patterns where they tend to sky rocket then fall harshly and rebound.  \n\nAs well, their respective financial positions do not really support their valuations.  In a dream scenario, they pullback significantly running into ER and then long into ER, or straddle atleast.  Playing it by ear and might sell monday if it shoots to new ATH but as of now Im holding until further news.  I also have a small stock positon in TVIX that ill prolly sell soon.  Im not a bear, I am nearly positive there will not be a recession, and if there is an overcorrection I will gladly start accumulating but for now the plan is this.  \n\nGodspeed, fellow autists.  \n\nAlso, whats the best WSB shirt(s)?  Saw a bunch on some website and might sport my autism if I make some tendies.  Whats your suggestions?", "created_utc": 1577500893, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/egkyy3/currently_all_in_on_amd_and_tsla_puts_expiring/", "is_self": true}
