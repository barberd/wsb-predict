{"id": "gac87f", "title": "Remdisivir probably doesn't work from current study results", "selftext": "So what's up, I'm not expert but I do have a university background that includes research processes, pharmacology, and statistics. \n\nSo the purpose of this study http://investors.gilead.com/node/36871/pdf was to examine whether a 5 versus 10 day course of remdesivir was preferable. It wasn't whether it was effective, it wasn't whether it was safe, simply comparing the 5 and 10 day course of treatment.\n\nSo for any drug you expect what's called a dose-response curve, which includes things like ed50, ld50, etc., and the more of a substance a person is given, the more of a response up until it's an effective dose, and if you keep going it's lethal.\n\nAnyhoo, the one major finding that can be taken from this paper as released isn't that remdesivir helped anyone, it isn't that remdesivir was safe or effective, it was that the longer a patient was on remdesivir the worse they did.\n\nQuoth the paper,\n> \u201cThese data are encouraging as they indicate that patients who received a shorter, 5-day course of remdesivir experienced similar clinical\nimprovement as patients who received a 10-day treatment course,\u201d said Aruna Subramanian, MD, Clinical Professor of Medicine, Chief,\nImmunocompromised Host Infectious Diseases, Stanford University School of Medicine, and one of the lead investigators of the study. \u201cWhile\nadditional data are still needed, these results help to bring a clearer understanding of how treatment with remdesivir may be optimized, **if proven safe\nand effective.\u201d**\n\nBasically in almost any circumstance you would not expect less treatment to yield a larger and better effect, other than if there was some sort of floor or ceiling effect. Instead the most probable explanation is that remdesivir doesn't work.\n\nThey're trying to pre-emptively spin that one niggling fact.\n\nedit: otherwise this study was not controlled, blinded, or compared in any way, and wasn't actually really a research study as most people would understand it. There are blinded and controlled studies, but those results would be unknown because they're blinded.\n\nedit 2:  To make it clear, similar outcome = substantially worse for the 10 day group.\n\nedit: they lay out their figures poorly, but deaths were actually 8% in the 5 day, and 11% in the 10 day. Way higher. All the figures are laid out in a really confusing way\n\nClinical recovery 129 (65) 106 (54) 0.17\nDischarge 120 (60) 103 (52) 0.44\nDeath 16 (8) 21 (11) 0.70\nSafety\nAny adverse event (AE) 141 (71) 145 (74) 0.86\nGrade \u22653 study drug-related AE 8 (4) 10 (5) 0.65\nStudy drug-related serious adverse event (SAE) 3 (2) 4 (2) 0.73\nAE leading to discontinuation 9 (5) 20 (10) 0.07\n\nThe last numbers seem to be p values, which if so means nothing was significant in this study, as p < .05 is the minimal standard for anything. So **5 day remdesivir** condition shows a better recovery rate and a better death rate than the **10 day** condition. The difference is non significant, therefore \"similar\".\n\nThis is a POOR study result that is masquerading as a home run.\n\nlast edit: I made a joke earlier that by \"positive results\" they meant they HAD results. The reason why I made that joke is because that's what positive means in a statistical or scientific context. \n\nI think I was dead on. They have positive results. They're just pretty bad.", "created_utc": 1588176395.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gac87f/remdisivir_probably_doesnt_work_from_current/", "is_self": true}
