{"id": "dq8yp2", "title": "Can option prices ever go negative? A ramble.", "selftext": "Random Friday thought experiment. Can option premiums ever go negative? \n\nAt first, this sounds crazy. Why would an option market maker *pay you* to write you an option contract that you would be long and they would be required to deliver on if assigned? \n\nTL;DR at bottom. \n\nAnd it is crazy but it doesn't mean it can't happen. If you are young you may not remember, but back in the day the idea of negative interest rates sounded crazy and impossible too. Pretty much every economist and journalist that was asked about negative rates (and even if they weren't asked) went around confidently saying *no one would ever pay someone to lend to them money!* Well that was wrong. It happened. It's happening. \n \n&gt; In finance, an option is a contract which gives the buyer (the owner or holder of the option) the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset or instrument at a specified strike price prior to or on a specified date, depending on the form of the option. (source wikipedia). \n\nThe important part of the options is not the retail side, where you buy a shitty little option from your phone. The important part is what's going on behind the scenes, where serious professional market makers (\"MMs\") are having an arms race as they compete. They are all trying to develop better technology and leverage their bank rolls in creative ways in order to hedge their book risk more effectively than all the other guys (who are just as smart and well-funded).  \n\nThe better an MM can hedge their book risk = the cheaper they can sell an option profitably. And whoever sells the option the cheapest will get the business in the open market.\n\nIf you look at option prices (in IV terms) on the major indexes, option prices are sliding down again and the long term historical trend is downward too (though we are not back at all time lows yet). \n\nAn at the money SPY monthly call or put (Nov 15 expiration) costs less than $3. Less than 1% of SPY. Meaning whoever sells that options loses money (and potentially loses a lot of money) if SPY moves just 1% between now and expiration. \n\n**Why are all these option makers selling equity options so cheap?** \n\nBecause of competition. Because of the way the market is structured. Because of regulation or lack of. And because option market makers have gotten fucking good at hedging (seriously good. Some MM desks at the BB bank level can go the entire year and not have one red day. Not one day where they lose money). \n\nAs MMs get better at hedging, option prices get cheaper. But even if a firm isn't as good at hedging and would rather not sell options so cheap due to risk, there is a business imperative to keep selling options anyway. The dumb loser MM firms can and will still sell cheap options but they will have to raise their VaR and sell options at prices lower than they hedge can effectively. \n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* There's an arms race among MMs to use technology and other financial engineering to get better at hedging option risk. And they are very good\n\n* There's competition at the lowest price that can be hedged effectively so in order to win business and get a sale MMs start undercutting each other pushing prices even lower by raising the book risk they carry\n\n* Options are standard contracts so the lowest price wins.\n\n* In theory this could continue even lower. Options get cheaper and cheaper. Eventually options could become free. And even negative. \n\nHow would this work in reality? Honestly I haven't gotten that far. That would take some thinking. Which is why this the post title is a question. But IN THEORY. IN THEORY. There might be a way.  Maybe with  a combination of things like margin, escrow, dutch auctions and things like, maybe it would only work with europeans or only OTMs. I mean fees are already $0. Maybe fees can go negative.
