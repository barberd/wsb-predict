{"id": "ds9dyc", "title": "Role of King (CANDY CRUSH) in ATVI Q3 Earnings", "selftext": "I'm seeing a lot of optimism about ATVI based on Activision and Blizzard, but I haven't seen any talk about King. \n\nATVI is made up of Activision, Blizzard, and King.\n\nTo my understanding the barometer used by big fish investors/analysts to gauge the health of gaming companies is Monthly Active Users (MAU). Last quarter one of the main reasons ATVI did poorly was due to a decline in MAU. King was responsible for 258 million of ATVI's 327 million MAU. For the past half decade or so, King's MAU has steadily been declining.\n\nI feel pretty good about Activisions Q3 performance and guidance with the  success of CoD Mobile and Modern Warfare. I also feel pretty good about Blizzard with WoW Classic and a decent pipeline announced at Blizzcon. The wildcard in my mind is King.\n\nHave Candy Crush and King's other mobile games been doing well? Is the success of Activision and  Blizzard enough to mitigate the decline of King??\n\nSomething to consider before gambling on Q3 earnings. The success or failure of your Q3 YOLO might be determined more by Candy Crush than CoD or WoW.", "created_utc": 1573005395, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ds9dyc/role_of_king_candy_crush_in_atvi_q3_earnings/", "is_self": true}
