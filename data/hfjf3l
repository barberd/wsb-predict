I'm sure it's been posted already. \n\nFor those that are stupid or have confused the WHO with the grammy award winning rock band, The World Health Organization is nice enough to give us an entire list of every vaccine being developed and how far along they are in clinical trials. \n\nBe careful investing in any of those vaccines beyond the first 3. \nTwo special considerations that I am personally invested in are Dynavax and Pfizer. \nDynavax is continuing to add new companies they are collaborating with for vaccine candidates. Pfizer stock has been beaten to shit and they've made some interesting moves to survive the pandemic. \n\nIf you really want the awful shit protein spike vaccines, go for it. I'm not an expert on virology but they don't sound as promising as a viral vector, RNA, or DNA method. \n\nSARS and MERS are both coronaviruses. It is not guaranteed, but there is a higher chance that the vaccine platforms that worked for SARS and MERS may work for Covid-19. \n\nThat being said, AstraZeneca to the fucking moon. 50C 1/21/22\n\nGood luck artists.", "created_utc": 1593078910.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hfjf3l/updated_vaccine_database_from_the_who/", "is_self": true}
