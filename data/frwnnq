Today was not going to be bloody because the last couple Monday\u2019s were, there needs to be a catalyst. An oil war between Russia and Saudi Arabia collapsing oil prices during a pandemic, for instance, is a good catalyst. \n\nBad news in a time where we expect there to be bad news is not a catalyst, all these discussions about the fed collapsing the RE sector by buying MBS is a theory, not a catalyst. It could be a catalyst if it actually collapses. \n\nThe market is as complex or as simple as you want it to be, it could be going up simply because everyone is short and there\u2019s a lot of institutional buying for portfolio rebalancing, the buying pressure on the small float is driving prices up slowly as we are seeing now. Please use your brain and think through some other possibilities.\n\nBuy puts, but also buy some calls and hedge, don\u2019t buy short expiration with exposure to one side unless you want to get wrekt.\n\nPositions: Spy 5/15 225p", "created_utc": 1585594223.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frwnnq/stocks_dont_just_go_down_cause_you_said_so/", "is_self": true}
