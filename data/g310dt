Chk & WLL are soon to be dead, watchout for the fake spike and blow down later today.\n\nUS alone can't pump oil prices, unlike Stocks the demand has to go up. EU, China, South America & rest of Asia's demand have dropped significantly. \n\nUS have to print billions for the global demand to save the price, which is highly unlikely. Trump can save shale companies at the very best but oil prices will be low for few months.", "created_utc": 1587126354.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g310dt/oil_demand_wont_bounce_back_anytime_soon_18barrel/", "is_self": true}
