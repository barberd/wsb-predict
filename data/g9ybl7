{"id": "g9ybl7", "title": "Options Buying and VIX", "selftext": "I posted this earlier but was removed for some reason. Not sure if this sub is compromised by MM or this sub is manipulating options for MM.\n\nHere is the original post, a lot of people messaged me asking about this post, so posting it again.\n\nI have theory MM regularly crush VIX in order to destroy option values, this more than anything else hurts retail since they see big paper losses in their account and panic.\n\nAs a general rule, you should be buying options when VIX is down since the option is cheaper. And sell options when VIX is higher.\n\nIf you buy an option when VIX is lower, even if underlying move against you but volatility increases the value will increase.\n\nWhen VIX is lower it's a great time to buy OTM options since they are comparatively much cheaper than when VIX is higher.  ATM and ITM options are less effected by IV than OTM.\n\nYou can't compare current VIX to all-time high or low, but relative to last month and last week.\n\nThere is big tech earning, so higher volatility is expected after earnings.\n\nDo you think we will remain very calm for next month? If yes don't buy options (or better sell options). If not you should be buying options.  \n\n\nAlso from past crashes, there is always a second VIX up event. Not saying it will happen but good chance you will glad you have the option when that happens. \n\nCatalyst\n\n1. Oil Glut, it should be here for at least 4-5 months\n2. Earning Seasons\n3.
