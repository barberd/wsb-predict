This is mostly because institutional investors own most of it and the low float causes a lot of volatility. \n\nBut one thing I noticed that I hadn't noticed before is a market cap of 12b. And yeah, pe is high, I know. It just seems it is undervalued based on what it does: targeted ads for like the whole internet. And in a market where we have multiple tech and cloud companies that aren't profitable but are worth 30b+, and TTD is profitable, it seems it's actually a pretty good buy, especially on any selloffs.", "created_utc": 1577381302, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/efy6ca/without_knowing_everything_about_ttd/", "is_self": true}
