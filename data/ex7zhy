{"id": "ex7zhy", "title": "Help a fellow autist", "selftext": "Losses on investment for a dependent\n\nSo I got this app called Robinhood and I lost all my portfolio through a series of bad decisions. I am not sure if I have to report or not. I would like to state that I AM A DEPENDENT and my parents claim me every year. I also file for taxes because I had a part time job. I\u2019ve searched the web and found lots of various answers and I need some legit help/straight forward response. Will I have to tell my parents about my losses? Do keep in mine they are claiming me and I am also filing taxes. \n\nI found this on reddit which is especially scaring me \u201cHe has an even larger Risk... if they are claiming as a dependent they are going need his 8949 and schedule D. They will be instantly flagged when Robinhood reports to IRS and there isn't a matching field in the tax return. That stuff is all automated now.\u201d It\u2019s an old post of someone asking the same question.\n \nSo please if someone here is an expert some straight answers will be appreciated! I\u2019d rather get scolded than have the IRS flag me or my parents.", "created_utc": 1580572254, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ex7zhy/help_a_fellow_autist/", "is_self": true}
