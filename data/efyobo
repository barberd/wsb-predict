{"id": "efyobo", "title": "TSLA... Overvalued?", "selftext": "Is TSLA overvalued? \n\nI don't think so. To me, there are two ways to look at TSLA. One is as a car company. The other is as a car+tech company. Regardless of the way you look at it, it's not overvalued. \n\nI won't get into all the details because I don't think it's necessary. It's possible to value TSLA with a simple comparison. TSLA is already valued more than car companies like Ford. And rightly so. Toyota is worth about 230b, currently about 3 times what TSLA is valued. Toyota got that market cap because their cars are known as quality and dependable, plus they've penetrated a lot of markets. TSLA is more comparable to Toyota because they're earning a reputation of quality and people want their cars, and those that have them are loyal to them. TSLA is attempting to penetrate other markets, especially China. \n\nToyota has about 4.5% China market share. TSLA has well below 1% I believe, but given China being largest and fastest growing EV market, it's pretty safe to assume TSLA will get at least 4.5% market share. \n\nI think TSLA is better compared to a top car company like Toyota than others. That puts it at 3 times higher share price than it's at now. TSLA is doing much more than just cars though, and their potential for so much more is pretty high. So a 3 times higher share price is the low estimate for their share price, $1290 per share. It'll take years but I believe it's more than within reach.\n\nSo $1290 is my low end estimate. My high end estimate is more difficult to estimate. TSLA could extend past cars into tech like software, or even gadgets, who knows. If that happens, sky is the limit and it could even gain an additional 100b+ in market cap. So my top end estimate is $1920. These estimates are years in the future though, not your typical 1 year estimate that analyst firms put out. My one year estimate is at least $520, it'll have multiple earning report beats that push it up.", "created_utc": 1577383621, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/efyobo/tsla_overvalued/", "is_self": true}
