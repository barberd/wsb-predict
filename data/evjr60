I know it\u2019ll take like 10 fun boy replies to get one of you fuckers to offer some helpful words too. \n\nSerious question first: I was talking to another real life reading friend, and telling him this story, and he froze up to say he lost all his money on SPY calls. Dunno how serious he is, but also read earlier about a guy who got sick of SPY going up and call premiums going down, amongst other bullshit. Why does this happen? Just theta?\n\nFunny story: \n1. Last week read about buying calls on stonks that only go up. I\u2019m not that retarded, but seemed better than trading pharma trash, which has been making me some tender tendies. \n2. SPY drops all week. I bought 2/21 monthlies so I hold. Nbd \n3. Fucking virus comes around Friday. One of my friends tells me he bought a bunch of virus related stonks. \n4. Monday I still hold. I get smoked. Friend profits well. \n5. Tuesday the fucking oven opens wide and lets the tendies flow.\n6. I do a limit sell on my calls to preserve the losses I reversed. SPY drops. Sell won\u2019t execute. \n7. RH does that fucking glitch where you cancel a sell and it takes forever to return the contracts to you so you can try again. \n8. I get impatient and refresh the page, RH jumps tabs to \u201cbuy\u201d from \u201csell\u201d\n9. I double my position AND now can\u2019t sell because of PDT. \n10. So far SPY keeps climbing, praying it doesn\u2019t happen down overnight before I can at least sell half of my position back. \n\n11. TLDR - read SPY only goes up, bought before virus, got smoked twice, made back losses, RH glitched when trying to close position before #beargang pops back in, doubles my position instead, praying SPY stays strong. \n\nYeah. Don\u2019t hit refresh on RH and click green buttons without reading the shit above it.", "created_utc": 1580283482, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/evjr60/ill_trade_you_a_yolo_story_for_actual_good_advice/", "is_self": true}
