{"id": "euz7s4", "title": "Consolidated Chinese Market Virus Guide", "selftext": "Ok, so we all know there's the Coronavirus going around. Here's my unsolicited advice:\n\n*What to do right now*\nIf you own any Chinese stock, get out of your position right now. If you have any calls that expire within the next few weeks, I would strongly advise you exit those as well. Protect yourself from further losses immediately. \n\n*What to watch for*\nKeep your eyes and ears peeled for the apex of viral infection. When numbers of infected peak and level off, you may want to consider getting back into the market. \n\n*What to buy right now*\nRight now buying puts on most individual Chinese stocks and indexes should prove to be fruitful. Better to get them now rather than later.\n\n*What to buy later*\nAny stock that was heavily depressed by the news, that you believe is undervalued and will rebound quickly. You may want to also keep an eye on American companies that manufacture in China. If this goes on longer than a week, their production lines will be affected and they will be ripe for buying opportunities later as well.\n\nSome of my favorite stocks at the moment are Chinese. The big three I am most interested in are Luckin' Coffee, NIO and Alibaba. All are in and will continue to be driven into bargain territory this week due to the extended Chinese New Years Holiday and likely even further beyond that.\n\n*What's the buy point*\nThis is hugely speculative, but here are my predictions on the best buying points for my three mentioned stocks above:\n\nLK:\nAttractive - $30\nGet In Now - $24\nMust Buy - $18 and below\n\nNIO:\nAttractive - $3\nBuy Now - $2.50\nThrow Your Money At It - $2 and below\n\nBABA:\nAttractive: $200\nBuy Now: $160\nMortgage your home: $135 and below\n\n*What does all of this mean*\nIt means you have the buying opportunity of the year or possibly even years in these stocks. As long as the virus doesnt kill off too many people, the Chinese economy will bounce back even stronger and your profits will swell along with it. \n\n*Final Thoughts*\nKeep your cool and focus on profiting in these market conditions. Many opportunities are presenting themselves, have the calm sense to realize what they are. I have already eaten losses myself. If you have too, pick yourselves up, pat yourself on the back and get your ass back in the game\n\nBest of luck to all my WSBros and well-wishes to all those who are suffering in China from the direct and indirect effects of the coronavirus.", "created_utc": 1580179291, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/euz7s4/consolidated_chinese_market_virus_guide/", "is_self": true}
