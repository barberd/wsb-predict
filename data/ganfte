{"id": "ganfte", "title": "GDP doesn\u2019t matter", "selftext": "Idk why everyone here (re: bears) think GDP reports directly tie to stock prices, especially in the short run, and especially when an external force is causing a halt in GDP.  It never has been true at a micro or a macro level.  The same way the autistic teams at Goldman place staggering valuations on companies that make no profit or don\u2019t yet have a complete revenue model.  Valuation is the perception of future profit not production.  It all goes back to basic Econ and finance which you probably all failed.\n\nThis \u201crecession\u201d has only impacted cash reserves of a few companies, and no capital flight has occurred. No No contractions in investment dollars, no sell-off and dissolution of institutions.  It did not occur because of bad investments or mismanagement of interest rates.  It is because there is a bad illness going around.\n\nOnly small, inefficient ankle biter companies will go under and Trump sure isn\u2019t going to let a giant business go under.  If you fell asleep during Econ 101, you probably missed the part where small businesses don\u2019t matter to the stock market.  Laid off wage-slaves at Kohl\u2019s don\u2019t matter.  Nonessential roles don\u2019t matter.  Alcoholic restaurant owners don\u2019t matter and neither do the struggling strip clubs they patronize.  Only big companies with lots of capital matter and so do the high income individuals who have mortgages and investment accounts which fund investment in that capital.\n\nBest yet, many companies have basically conducted a forced layoff of ALL non-essential staff.  They can now go through serious restructuring on a massive scale with minimal impact to perceived reputation.  Also, high unemployment means you can replace your bad employees with better ones, especially if they\u2019re remote.  Bring back only the productive employees and completely cut ineffective business segments.  The kicker -  management has ample time to do this math now and do it comprehensively, a rare opportunity.\n\nIt is the market who is correct and it is assuming that corporate profits will be high in the future.  It\u2019s that simple.  Because rich people will still have jobs and titans of industry will still be there and be as efficient as possible.\n\nSource: my degree in economics", "created_utc": 1588214598.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ganfte/gdp_doesnt_matter/", "is_self": true}
