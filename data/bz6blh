The drop from 215 to 90 or so was a full 3 months before the lockup period ended and happened over just about 15 days. After lockup ended it also dropped over 60% but it took almost 6 months for it to slowly decline. \n\nJust curious why the focus on the lockup period ending? If you are banking on that then better buy super long dated puts. Honestly I think the better play here could be to sell far OTM puts since the IV is so high. That at least is the long play it would seem. Short term I would think puts at or before Aug and right around 100 strike. \n\nThoughts?", "created_utc": 1560217142, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bz6blh/everyone_posting_about_bynd_lockup_ending_be/", "is_self": true}
