You'd think the firms would by them.\n\nSo, Is there another option here? Or should I just keep selling until someone hopefully bites? My exp is June 5th.\n\nWorst case I'll have to risk adding a crap ton of money in the brokerage to exercise it, which I dont want to do.", "created_utc": 1590368104.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gq18f1/whats_the_strategy_for_selling_too_deep_in_the/", "is_self": true}
