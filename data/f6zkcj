We're dumb as rocks, armed with margin and options approval levels that nobody in their right minds should grant a 12 year old.\n\nSo, how do we use this? We aggregate our tiny, limp sticks into one large, girthy one, and fly this motherfucker to the moon.\n\nYou see this over and over again across the history of WSB - we've lifted SNAP, PCG, AMD, and many others up from the depths of hell and into meme glory.\n\nHere's your next ticker - OSTK.\n\nLet's make one thing perfectly clear - this is an amazing stock. They have been crushed by Wayfair, to the point where founder and [ex-CEO Patrick Byrne has fallen completely off the rails into deep state conspiracies and crypto nutter-hood.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/09/19/overstocks-former-ceo-sells-off-his-m-stake-saying-hes-worried-about-deep-state/)\n\nThat's not an exaggeration - in late August of last year, Patrick finally released his inner autist and went on an absolutely epic rant during a conference call, then abruptly [submitted his resignation in a, quite frankly, selfless display of insanity and Q-anon levels of paranoia](https://www.deepcapture.com/2019/09/a-message-to-my-former-colleagues-at-overstock/).\n\nHere's where we profit: Patrick still believes in the company. In his memo, he specifically notes his \"war chest\" of safe assets - crypto and commodities, both of which are up substantially, which he is committed to using to support the company via the purchase of stock on the open market.\n\n\"In fact, you will have not just access to capital, you will have access to the friendliest capital imaginable: my own. I have to wait six months for it to be legal, but anytime after March 17, 2020 I can provide a capital injection (if needed) by buying back into Overstock. Please remember that as you watch the global chaos. If you see the US economy cratering please do not lose the sleep you otherwise might: you will have a friend who has sunk (almost) his entire fortune into investments that will soar if a crisis occurs, and who knows your business well, and who appreciates you.\"\n\nMarch 17, 2020. A little under a month away and this crazy motherfucker is buying back in, and buying with conviction. April 03 calls will capture both their next ER, which should show a still-profitable business, and Patrick starting to accumulate stock again.\n\nTL:DR Buy OSTK 04/03 10C, 11C, and/or 12C", "created_utc": 1582232078, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6zkcj/i_had_a_meme_why_you_should_buy_ostk_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
