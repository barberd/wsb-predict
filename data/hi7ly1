One of two outcomes is going to happen imminently.\n\n1) The Fed allows nominal yields to keep rising. This would crash equities and real estate by 90%--it would be worse than the Great Depression. When nominal yields got to only 3% in 2018, the stock market plummeted from 26,500 to 22,500. This was averted only by restarting Q. E. Nowadays, even 1% yields crash the market. We nearly got to 1% yields on Friday--0.90%. Yields could spike any day now. This is why Warren Buffet is staying out of the stock market and hoarding silver.\n\n[look at this graph, mofo!](https://www.reddit.com/user/JPowBrrrr/comments/hi7fgi/jpow_will_to_steal_your_tendies/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\n2) The Fed puts a formal cap on yields, also known as YCC. This would be an admission that 5 trillion in Q. E. hasn't been enough to suppress yields, and that at least 20 trillion more is coming. This means hyperinflation, a crash in the bond market, and monetizing the debt. Stocks would soar in nominal terms, but crash against the price of gold, because hyperinflation would make the gains worthless, as they were in the Zimbabwe or Venezuelan stock-markets.\n\nIn other words, the stock market must crash soon. The only question is whether it will happen in nominal terms or real terms.\n\nI think we all know that the Fed will choose to crash it in real terms, because that is the only politically expedient option. The average Robinhood trader will be marvelling at his 500% gains, and the \"best\" stock market in human history, even though the U. S. dollar is on its way to being carried about in wheelbarrows.\n\nWhichever choice the Fed is going to make, the only way to profit from this crisis and protect yourself is to buy gold, gold miners, silver, and silver miners.\n\nTLDR: Long SLVR, RING, SGDM (and GDX if you're feelin' frisky)", "created_utc": 1593461286.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hi7ly1/jpow_is_gonna_steal_your_tendies_yet_again/", "is_self": true}
