This is a special one-time dividend due to NLOK selling their enterprise assets. The stock is only going to get affected by the massive dump after ex-div. The stock isn't going to drop over 40%.\n\n\nStock stays above $20 or ban\n\nEdit: Well this account got suspended permanently.\"\n\nAnd finnpharma who repeatedly argued even after I supported my position with multiple sources.\n\nAnd all you other dumb mofos that thought you could magically create value out of thin air w/ a dividend. Even after I nicely explained how it works.\n\nNlok closed at 28.42 on friday and opened at 16.71\n\n~12 drop, exactly as I explained.\n\nAlready had someone reply to the post crying about their puts.
