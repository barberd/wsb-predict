He introduced us to this stock and i'm still a believer in its undervaluation no matter how many storm clouds appear. 2020 will likely be microns year again just as 2017 was as memory prices bottom out this year and data center demand reignites.  Currently still sitting on 401 shares of MU at a 51.67 average that I've been selling covered calls on. Overall, these losses in its full culmination stemmed from some ill timed apple calls, 15k+ of FB shares at a 213 avg and MU shares/options. I decided to avg down 5k more at 160 that brought my avg to 199 which I finally sold off when it reached 200 this earnings. Needless to say, I will appreciate diversifying more instead of yoloing shares for earnings when a stock is at ATH and (also maybe size positions better). Thanks for all the humor over the many months WSB even as my account was sliding through the depths of hell in 2018. As a longtime lurker since the beginning of 2018, I decided to add my own recovery post. \n\n![img](x0w9p4q8i9w21)", "created_utc": 1557005664, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bkq3qz/i_have_since_recovered_from_mutoo_and_q2_fb_2018/", "is_self": true}
