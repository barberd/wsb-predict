OBLN Gets Pumped On\u00a0Seekingalpha](https://interactiveswingtrading.com/2019/05/31/fake-news-obln-gets-pumped-on-seekingalpha/)\n\n \n\n[**According to Tanzeel Akhtar\u00a0 of Benzinga**](https://www.benzinga.com/news/19/05/13822763/obalon-closes-above-1-following-questionable-takeover-rumor), the reason for OBLN\u2019s sudden price increase was due to a rumor started on SeekingAlpha which claimed Johnson and Johnson was considering buying OBLN for $8.00 per share.\n\nThe article has since been removed, which raises some red flags. Also, if you go to OBLN\u2019s website and look at their news page, you don\u2019t see anything current. In fact, the last time OBLN reported a material event was almost 1 year ago..\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/EZ9WAiK](https://imgur.com/a/EZ9WAiK)\n\nOBLN manufactures a novel weight loss product, what they call \u201cThe Obalon Balloon System\u201d, an inflatable balloon that stops you from eating.\n\n[Video describing The Obalon Balloon System](https://interactiveswingtrading.com/2019/05/31/fake-news-obln-gets-pumped-on-seekingalpha/)\n\n Honestly, before we watched this video, we thought this whole thing was a complete scam, but after watching it, you can kind of see how it might work\u2013 key word there might. This is America, and if that\u2019s what you wanna do, then that\u2019s what you wanna do. \n\n What is open to debate is whether this rumor is true. Did Johnson and Johnson put in a bid at $8 per share? If they did, why would the OP remove the post? Seems pretty strange don\u2019t you think? As it usually goes with online rumors in the stock market, there was no source, so we can never truly be sure what happened. If anybody can find the original article, please send it to us, we would love to read it. Until the time everyone, enjoy the rest of your day\\[\n\nsource article:  [https://interactiveswingtrading.com/2019/05/31/fake-news-obln-gets-pumped-on-seekingalpha/](https://interactiveswingtrading.com/2019/05/31/fake-news-obln-gets-pumped-on-seekingalpha/)", "created_utc": 1559328707, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bvbe0p/seeking_alpha_article_spreads_rumor_pumps_stock/", "is_self": true}
