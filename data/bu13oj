{"id": "bu13oj", "title": "BYND Analyst Coverage Finally Here", "selftext": "Finally we got BYND analyst coverage. Definitely not as bad as some thought it would be. \n\nJPMorgan initiates coverage on Beyond Meat with an Overweight rating and price target of $97.\n\nJP's bullish rating on Beyond Meat as the quiet period expires stands in contrast to the Neutral-equivalent ratings already doled out by [BAML](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3467035-baml-cautious-beyond-meat) ($85 PT), Credit Suisse ($70 PT), Goldman Sachs ($67 PT) and Jefferies ($85 PT).\n\nThere seems to be just enough runway that crazy dreamers will keep on buying. JPMORGAN: \"We view Beyond\u2019s growth opportunity as extraordinary: We model a Total Addressable Market (TAM) for plant-based meat in 15 years of $100B, up to 100x larger than today\u2019s. And we think Beyond\u2019s sales ultimately could exceed $5B versus $88MM last year ..\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPersonally I thought the analysts would give it a much lower PT, but I don't own calls because of the fundamentals- I own them for the short squeeze. On THAT note, there continues to be no shares available to short (lockup expires in 5+ months) and borrow rates are 55-83% that I have found today.", "created_utc": 1559055888, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bu13oj/bynd_analyst_coverage_finally_here/", "is_self": true}
