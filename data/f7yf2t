Looks like it's gonna do well after earning.  I plan to buy some calls on monday.  \n\nDBX is also doing really good.  I bought 10 calls before earning,  and they were making up for my loss on amd.  Also bought a few more calls after earning because the company is evolving into a profit making company.  Even when the market was dropping like crazy on friday,  DBX still managed to stay up almost 20%. \n\n60c 3/3 / 60c 3/20 might be good calls on ETSY\n27c 4/17 is dang cheap for DBX, i plan to buy some on monday too.  \nHopefully they can cover my msft loss too.", "created_utc": 1582403882, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7yf2t/any_one_buying_etsy_dbx_call_on_mondays/", "is_self": true}
