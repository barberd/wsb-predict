Brazil's president basically makes Trump look like Churchill. He's telling his country that contracting COVID-19 is similar to getting a \"little cold\" and that if he were to get it, he would recover because of his \"athletic background.\" There is one word for why Brazil is truly screwed. You ready?\n\nFavelas.\n\nThat's right, these shanty towns are all over the country and keep people living so close to each other it's basically impossible for 6 feet of separation between anyone. If they continue to ignore the problem, these whole towns could be wiped out. Brazil is treating this pandemic just about as recklessly as they can, and there is no indication that Brazil is preparing.\n\nPositions: EWZ $11p 5/15 and $19p 6/19", "created_utc": 1585252611.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpieo6/brazil_is_still_ignoring_the_pandemic/", "is_self": true}
