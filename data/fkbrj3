This news came this morning, but we've been expecting it for a while now, as Hygienists and Dentists are number 1 and 2 overall at risk professions for COVID-19\n\nThis shut down isn't nationwide yet, but it will be. The main dental suppliers are short of supplies and greatly limiting what we can order. On top of that, they won't have many new incoming orders during this shut down (which could extend past April 16). \n\nThe main suppliers we use are Patterson ($PDCO), Dentsply ($XRAY), and Henry Schein (HSIC).
