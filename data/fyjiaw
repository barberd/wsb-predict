Antibody testing can help us enroll convalescent plasma donors.  \n\nOnce we are past the peaks which should be April and May we can start going from mitigation to containment and tracing if we have widely available rapid testing (test results in less than one hour).\n\nOnce we have plenty of ppe and rapid testing hospitals can start doing elective procedures again by pretesting patients prior to the procedure.  \n\nWork places could do screening and testing prior to coming in also with social distancing and masks until there is a vaccine.  \n\nI don\u2019t think the market goes down unless there is another catastrophic problem that is not amendable to FED and Treasury intervention.
