{"id": "c069sw", "title": "$CBLK and $CRWD", "selftext": "Crowdstrike and Carbon Black sell the same stuff - a modern AV solution they call endpoint security. Crowdstrike is marginally better and the two can largely be interchanged. \n\nCrowdstrike is newer, they have roughly same revenue. Carbon black is glowing slower (20% vs 100%), they recently shifted to cloud SASS model similar to Crowdstrike. \n\nCrowdstrike is doing some serious marketing, Logan airport luggage belts were all plastered with their ads - doesn't seem like the best location to advertise - makes we think their spiked growth is one off and they will grow at lower pace soon. \n\nNow CBLK has market cap 1Bish while CRWD is 10Bish - so like when Icahn bought Lyft thinking if Uber is worth Y, Lyft is worth more than Y/10; I am buying this CBLK simply because it is likely worth more than CRWD/10.", "created_utc": 1560434930, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c069sw/cblk_and_crwd/", "is_self": true}
