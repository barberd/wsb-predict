An oil company already dead before the oil bs? Can't go tits up.\n\nLol. I bought a single leap call for 2022 and this week those $10 is $100+ I rich. Honestly regretted not buying more.\n\nGood news came, if they couldnt get to $1 the SEC would delist them. Then came the bull analysis after they announce restructuring @ $4.52.\n\nMidnight drunk giving yall easy money even if u just want a pump and dump, but this shits going to launch for a while especially with recovering oil markets coming thanks to Pump Trump bailouts...I mean stimulus. Or just day trade on the pump and dumps if u rich\n\nkthxban", "created_utc": 1587715732.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g74iuk/wll_rocket_launch/", "is_self": true}
