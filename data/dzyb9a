Everyone knows this is the current bulk of the American truck buyers. But Everyone does not have the insight I do, having been born, bred, raised, salted, seared, seasoned, basted, and tantalized in the inner shitcircles of techbro startup wonderland. Initially, sales will be lower than expected on the new truck, because they'll be expecting the F-150 killer Elon has hyped.\n\nThe truck is marketed to appear late 2021 / early 2022. So Elon Time Adjustment early 2023. Tech Bros buy in intially, and keep steady growth. 2-3 years out hicks realize they can get more torks per dollar for tractor pull dick measuring contests, and refuiel for free with some gay ass blue panels over their barn. That means they don't have to go to the shitty gas station the sells beer, they can go to the proper liquor store and get their Miller High Life (the Champagne of Beers) for $2 cheaper per twelver. \"Pay fer isself 2 yrs n outtow yer doolie 'lijuh\" they say. By this time autopilot can take you to and from the titty bar 3.5 miles down West Orchard Road towards town safely, so you get proper blitzed on the recently federally mandated marijuana consumption and corn based vodka, support some single moms and columbian coca farmers, and cash in some tendies after hours on Disney-Robinhood-ReasearchInMotion AI powered investing app.\n\n##\u00a0Plays, chronilogically:\n\n**.5-1.0 year: **** strangle $TSLA as gigafactory chinaland pays off and supports pickup and semi truck disappointment and the price stays within 10%. grab now if you're looking for a long position if you're straight and white enough to actually have a real IRA\n\n**1.0-2.0 years:** hype about semi and pickup grows, despite initial criticism of both. autopilot still fucking delayed, but actually showing more rapid improvement compared to previous year. turns out machine learning is in fact exponential. Buy calls 1 year out before this hype ruins it\n\n**2.0-5.0 years:** tesla crazy pickup is actually mainstream and well respected by all classes, regardless of brand prefrences. there's competitor vehicles, but tesla is considered upper tier. Significant autonomy available, tesla rideshare is mildly profitable. reap IRA gains, assess fundamentals, re-evaluate. Realistically, this is the point where beaners will also really start buying into $TSLA, which is important, because they're a big part of the market. Even when they buy used, which a lot do, they float the resale price of the new, and the percieved value. And they love American made pickups. Mexico and Latin America is socialist as fuck too, so they're going to socialize and invest in public electric chargers.
