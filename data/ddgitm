I\u2019m still fairly new to options but I think I have a good understanding. \n\nI have about $25K and I\u2019ve been thinking about playing FB earnings at the end of this month. The past 2 years, the stock moved more than $10 after ER. My plan is to buy 50% put and 50% calls ATM the day before earnings are released. \n\nThis is what I\u2019m thinking inside my little brain...\nIMAGINE this week was earnings week for FB.\nThe 180 call and put strikes are about $2.5 per contract right now. It should drop as the week goes on, right? Or will the IV cause the prices to increase as the week goes on. \n\nAnyway, my plan is to play ATM paying $2.5 for each call and $2.5 for each put contracts expiring this week. I\u2019m too much of a pussy to go full on YOLO. So with $25K, I could buy 50x 180Calls and 50x 180Puts. Say FB beat earning... \n\n- Theta won\u2019t mean anything since I\u2019ll be in the money by then\n- My put contracts will be worthless and I lose $12,500\n- I should break even if FB moves $5.\n(50 call contract x $500 call price) - initial costs of the call and put contract $25,000 = $25,000\n- Any $ it moves after that I\u2019m looking at a profit of $100 per call contract? For example it moves $10 and now FB is trading at $190. My profit would be: \nSince call contract is now $10 ITM it\u2019ll be worth $1000 per contract. \n(50 call contracts x $1000) = $50,000\n($50,000 call profit - $12,500 put loss - $12,500 initial call cost) = $25,000 profit\n\nWhat are your thoughts on FB ER at the end of this month? Think it\u2019ll move $10 or more this time around? You guys think my play is somewhat safe?", "created_utc": 1570237584, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ddgitm/no_balls_of_steel_but_i_still_want_the_tendies/", "is_self": true}
