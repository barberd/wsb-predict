{"id": "g9bdgs", "title": "Questions on Bankruptcy", "selftext": "Hello everyone, hope you had a lovely Monday. I've got some questions about some things regarding bankruptcy. I'm going to use WLL as an example.\n\n1)Okay my first and most important, how long after announcing its going bankrupt will shareholders have before changes to the stock take effect? I notice WLL stated its going bankrupt and you will get 3% of restructured company, but they didnt say exactly when that will happen. \n\n2)The first question kinda leads to the second, what happens to any Long Puts i may have on the stock? Or will I have ample warning time as to an exact date the restructuring will take place? I don't do anything more than Robinhood so no real options i may be obligated to fill or something lol.\n\n3)Any useful strategies for stocks going bankrupt? I was planning on  putting in smart long puts on anything overvalued due to idiots investing and going bankrupt cause oils a train wreck.
