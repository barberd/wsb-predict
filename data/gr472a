{"id": "gr472a", "title": "1+1=?", "selftext": "FACT: Floors opened today\n\nFACT: For some \"complicated\" trades, the pit still exists.\n\nFACT: In the extended hours, certain players can make certain crazy trades. They even have special acronyms for those trades, but I don't wanna confuse us here.\n\nFACT: Some Centralbanks around the world have crazy exposure to US stocks that they do not really like. One example is Switzerland. Here is their latest official \"stock filing\": https://sec.report/Document/0001582202-20-000002/\n\nFACT: Just the Swiss National Bank has 650 millions in XOM Stock, or 809 Millions in BABA stock.\n\nFACT: Some Central Banks held Hertz - like the Swiss National Bank, swiss cheese sauce above\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Centralbanks might fear, that some more companys like Hertz might go down.\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Some Centralbanks might want to \"keep their face\", deleverage their liabilities by selling some stocks they don't like (like xom for the SNB since their population voted crazy green in the last year)\n\nFACT: Centralbank Holdings *could* crash *some* stocks.\n\nHYPOTHESIS: Centralbanks might prefer after hour trades with price lock in options.\n\nQUESTION: Why not tonight?\n\nIF I'M WRONG: I'll eat healthy tomorrow. Maybe even an avocado. I hate those especially.\n\nPOSITION: any spy puts any date\n\n#GayBearsUnite and attack now!", "created_utc": 1590522528.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gr472a/11/", "is_self": true}
