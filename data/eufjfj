{"id": "eufjfj", "title": "I'm accidentally holding options into earnings. AMA", "selftext": "Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. (SKT) is a small-cap REIT that own shitty outlet malls across the United States. It's a lackluster company in a dying industry; its stock price is down 60% over the past five years, and there's a ton of short interest. However, since SKT has not cut its dividend for many years, its dividend yield has climbed steadily, to over 9%. This means that dividend yield ETFs bought a lot of the stock.\n\nIn particular, the S&amp;P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats ETF (SDY), which is dividend-weighted, ended up owning about 22% of the float at the end of last year. However, the index that it tracks has a market cap floor, which SKT fell below. As of 1/31, SDY will have to sell its entire stake in the company. This is a possible catalyst for a big move down in the stock price. In addition, as SDY recalls its loaned-out shares and the market positions for that big move down, many of the shorts will have to cover their positions, creating a possible short squeeze.\n\nThis was my thinking last week when I bought an options position on SKT, seeking to profit from either or both of a short-squeeze run up or a forced selling gap down. IV was pretty high at the time---I'm far from the first person who noticed this trade---but earnings weren't expected until mid-February, and my plan was to sell the position on 2/3 at the earliest. Things looked pretty good at first, as SKT's price sawtoothed up and down and lending costs to short sellers spiked. But then on Friday afternoon three things happened:\n\n1. SKT traded several million shares at the close, possibly related to SDY, or possibly related to its moving from S&amp;P mid-cap funds to small-cap funds;\n2. S&amp;P officially announced that the stock would be removed from the index effective next Friday, as expected; and most crucially\n3. SKT announced its 19Q4 earnings call would be *Monday morning before market open*. Like, tomorrow.\n\nSo yeah, thanks to my own dumb gambling problem, I'm now holding options into an earnings call where they'll probably also announce that some hedge fund bought SDY's 20% stake just to fuck over the shorts like me. The IV crush is gonna be huge, just hoping there's enough price movement that I can come out about even.\n\ntl;dr read the actual story you fucking degenerates", "created_utc": 1580083513, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eufjfj/im_accidentally_holding_options_into_earnings_ama/", "is_self": true}
