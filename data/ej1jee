I just bought 20% portfolio in puts on AMTD because they credited me for trades that didn't go through, giving me 170 dollars! Its insane. I could've lied and said i tried to sell at peak but didn't. Glad they took care of me but still people could lie about when they tried to place a trade. Its like selling when u can see the chart. If everyone is getting credited for there losses due to not being able to sell, then they have lost millions today. \n\nFYI: if you lost money today call or chat with them and they will credit you the difference.
