{"id": "fe7ett", "title": "(DD) Hanesbrands $HBI Tender Machine", "selftext": "All right boys, listen up. This is more for the sake of a I-told-you-so in a few months when Hanes has doubled in price, but to any retard out there with cash left to dispense, I suggest taking a peek at this opportunity and drawing your own conclusion based on how many tenders you believe you can swindle off of this stock fucking mooning. \n\nHanes is the AAPL of underwear. They currently have double the market share of the next leading competitor, and dominate undergarment sales in multiple countries. Hanes owns all of their own factories and production lines, which has allowed them to increase production efficiency by 33% while increasing factory output by 90% at the same fucking time over the span of the last twelve years. I can't make this shit up, I'm regurgitating this right off of morningstar through my expensive ass subscription. Their fair value estimate is at $27 right now, and the stock is trading at fucking $12.40.\n\nThough the fucking killer is, they own Champion. That's right. The brand that teenagers are going fucking insane for, through their collaborations with Supreme, Vetements and Tommy Hilfiger. If those names mean nothing to you, just understand that Champion alone has sold over $2 billion dollars in sales, which is fucking nearly half of their market cap right now. This shit cannot go tits up!\n\nHeres the DD though, buy shares, and just hold them. You heard me. No needing to gamble away your  mommies allowance anymore, when you could park it into the next fucking AAPL (of underwear) \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/cRtPhDh](https://imgur.com/a/cRtPhDh)", "created_utc": 1583465205, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fe7ett/dd_hanesbrands_hbi_tender_machine/", "is_self": true}
