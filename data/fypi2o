{"id": "fypi2o", "title": "2008 VS 2020 IS THE DROP OVER? -SEE CHART", "selftext": "I have a BB attached and it has 3 bands, in 2008 before the big drop there was an initial drop and then a bounce that came up and touched the middle band. Finally we see the big drop and the huge open of the bands. I also used an RSI to show the level we are at vs 2008 as you can see it bounces from the 40 comes down through that and then this is also when the bands open up wider. Based on that it looks like 2020 has more to drop the bands haven't opened up much yet and I see the RSI dropping below 40, I drew a mock representation of the BB opening and the RSI dropping. If we do see the S&P drop a similar % drop like 08 we would see it under 1700. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rdjgaav072s41.png?width=1758&format=png&auto=webp&s=92ff74a5d1562f90dbc4162c390c78d126d34b58", "created_utc": 1586554863.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fypi2o/2008_vs_2020_is_the_drop_over_see_chart/", "is_self": true}
