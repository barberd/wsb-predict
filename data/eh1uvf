Weakness in business, crashing stock, top exec's leaving, insiders selling, massive amounts of people shorting, etc. The list will go on and on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, people are forgetting we are in the December dump season. That's right! Just about all stocks, this year are up 40% causing massive tax bills for anyone cashing out! However, what's the one way to reduce that? That's right dumping your $ACB stocks for $2 to capture their 80% loss from buying early in the year at $10. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHeres where things get interesting. Earlier this week a bald blind guy posts a fake story about a possible partnership with coke. Despite nobody falling for this shit (because how the fuck can the blind guy have filmed the video if he's blind), the stock moved up 9% instantly! \n\nWhy might the stock move that much if the story was so short-lived? That's because the huge hedge funds shorting it were quick to rebuy their shares to avoid a potential short-squeeze if the rumor was prolonged. What this means comes Jan. 1st, that tax year resets so people won't be selling to capture loss and hedge funds can start to take advantage of short squeezing people. That is why it's likely not going any lower and buying it can reap a massive profit when it does pump.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL-DR: Stock is down due to massive short-sellers taking advantage of knowing in this year there are not many stocks to sell for loss-capturing tax purposes. The stock also is easily pumped which can cause a rapid short squeeze. The best thing to do is get into prior to Jan 1st for when the momentum picks up.", "created_utc": 1577595840, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eh1uvf/if_you_are_wanting_free_money_make_sure_you/", "is_self": true}
