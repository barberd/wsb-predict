Negotiated extension with vendors in terms for AP\n3. Immediately applied for all government assistance as well as additional lines of credit\n4. Monitoring AR, especially watching for influx in late/no payments as well as AR ratio\n5. Immediately reverted back to 2019 budgets\n6. Immediately eliminated all non critical expense spending \n\n\nOur sales have leveled at about 50% down. I expect it to get worse.\n\nI couldn\u2019t imagine being a business owner of something completely shutdown such as a gym or restarting, at least we still have minor revenues coming in.\n\nI\u2019d imagine that the vast majority of businesses are going through this.\n\nOne thing I constantly wonder is wtf is going to happen when when all these businesses are taking on LOC\u2019s, extending AP payment terms to the max, cutting massive expenses, etc etc, it makes me question what\u2019s the end result of all this leveraging, I just can\u2019t see how it can end well.\n\nPrior to this we have decent cash savings and operated fairly frugal. I cannot imagine being a business owner right now who had low cash reserves or were overly leveraged, they will be annihilated.\n\nThis shit is going to fucking destroy many businesses. I don\u2019t think people truly realize the negative impact that\u2019s still be had on the economy, we are just at the beginning.\n\n\nSPY $240p 5/15", "created_utc": 1586037565.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fv27mu/business_owner_perspective/", "is_self": true}
