NASA has showed satellite images of massive air pollution reductions caused by an essential halt on not only the economy, but transportation. What causes most air pollution? Oil baby. That rich Saudi gold. \n\nKeep an eye on air pollution levels from NASA satellite images, when pollution normalizes and the global warming is back on, it's a sure fire sign that the oil demand is back up. \n\nI'll say above as if I was intelligent now: the reduction in economic activity shifted the demand curve for oil inwards, reducing price equilibrium. This shift in the demand curve was causes by a market externality, the bat flu. A bi product of the bat flu is a world wide economic shutdown, reducing economic activity and oil demand, while also reducing pollution. Pollution returning to normalized levels is an early indication of increased demand for oil, shifting the demand curve outward, resulting in a higher equilibrium. \n\nTLDR; don't just buy oil calls cuz oil only goes up. But it because of air pollution.", "created_utc": 1586942749.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1oo2c/how_to_get_saudi_rich_on_wti_seriously/", "is_self": true}
