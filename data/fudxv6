Have any of you savants employed such a technique?\n\nIn all seriousness, as degenerate and dumb as everyone here is, I honestly believe you are more informed than the goons in the general public that CNBC caters to. As a \"sophisticated\" market participant myself, I have taken a position in LK selling the 4p/1p 4/17 put spread for a 0.45 credit. Why  buy the $1p you might ask? It's to cap my buying power as a spread, and not need to worry about TD bitching at me about margin requirements. If you want to go naked, by all means do so. The $4p (4/17) is currently selling for around $0.55. It is essentially bankruptcy insurance at this point. Two weeks for a potential \\~12.5% gain with respect to maximum risk?
