{"id": "ewpqwe", "title": "Someone please confirm whether I understand options or I'm just dumb", "selftext": "Okay so there was this really good explanation on how options work by u/Logan_Maransy (thanks) and since I'm new to options trading I just want to know whether I'm correct. Consider the attachment I just got from Yahoo Finance (Strike, Latest, Bid, Ask...). Correct me if I'm wrong, but thos allows me to buy 100 GOOG options for a strike price of $1.475. The date for this option is 7-Feb. The price to buy this is $0.75 per contract (which is now the ask), or $75 total.\n\nSo when GOOG's earnings next week beat all expectations and it increases to, let's say, $1,550, the option is in the money and I can sell it for about the difference between the current price and the strike price (since I do not have $147.500... yet), making me about 100\\*(1,550-1,475)-(100\\*0.75) = $7,425\n\nIf they don't and my options expire, I lost $75. \n\n... right? Or am I missing something?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ap0f4iugp4e41.png?width=1776&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12b54f83404e57b9662a6910165c3dddee48cb2d", "created_utc": 1580483299, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ewpqwe/someone_please_confirm_whether_i_understand/", "is_self": true}
