I\u2019ve confirmed this via the CLI tool of my RH options API with AMD, you\u2019ll see I am able to get the info on the $12 strike which is not disabled, but when I go one option deeper to the $10 strike, an error is thrown:\n\n[RH api](https://imgur.com/a/u6rKuWI)\n[RH app options](https://imgur.com/gallery/PHkRoHt)", "created_utc": 1573136744, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dsyfn8/confirmation_that_current_rh_patch_is_indeed/", "is_self": true}
