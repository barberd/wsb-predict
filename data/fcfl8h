You went on a road trip, and had half a tank left along the drive.\n\nYou pass by a gas station with that half tank but say... \"nah we can make it to the next one.\"\n\nWith half a tank just about anywhere there's always at least a few gas stations.\n\nSo you go on, get to a quarter of a tank... Then say it's time to pull over. You stop at the first gas station and they're closed.\n\nOk, you say, there's another one 2 miles up the road.\n\nNext one... They have no gas.\n\nNow you're getting fucked.\n\nThe last one in town. Nope, power's out.\n\nAt that point you're eating questionable bean burritos from maybel's Mexican grill to make enough farts to get out of town.", "created_utc": 1583170331, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcfl8h/how_i_described_the_rh_outage_to_a_friend/", "is_self": true}
