I\u2019ve been watching the stock for a while and it absolutely tumbled through my price point so said fuck it and picked up some shares. Just last month there were talks about possible acquisition which boosted it quite a bit. Earnings report came out, they narrowly missed estimates but guided hella negative. Am I an idiot for thinking this drop is due to factors that are for the most part temporary? Aside from their debt issue, they seem like a solid growth company and this feels like a great discount buy right now. \n\n\nAlso, why isn\u2019t Wayfair feeling the heat of the tariffs?  \n\n\nSomeone please tear down my optimism.", "created_utc": 1559859705, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bxmv5l/at_home_group_home_down_57_due_to_weather_and/", "is_self": true}
