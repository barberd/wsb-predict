Everyone is sitting at home snapping and scrolling through Facebook. \n\nGoogle is going to get hit because SMALL BUSINESS advertises there. \n\nFacebook on the other hand is where big corporations do their marketing. Scroll through Facebook. There\u2019s tons of ads all by big companies that have the cash and are still spending top dollar to get your business. You\u2019ll see ads like McDonald\u2019s and shit but you won\u2019t see Larry\u2019s Lawn Mowing service on Facebook. Not only that but Facebook just bought some Indian telecom stake at $6B cash. Like these fuckers clearly have cash flow right now. \n\nBig corporations are doing fine on cash and are still buying ads. Small business is absolutely fucked. FB Calls. Goog puts maybe but it\u2019s still tech so who the fuck knows. \n\nI personally loaded up on $1k OTM FD FB Calls.", "created_utc": 1587707670.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g72ybs/cant_cuck_the_zuck_facebook_dd/", "is_self": true}
