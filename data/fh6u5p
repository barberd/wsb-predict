Zillow ($Z) is done for.", "selftext": "I\u2019ve [now made $165k in 3 weeks,](https://imgur.com/gallery/QFFIhEc) and this will be my coup de grace. \n\nMany of you have been [following along with my posts. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/feqfb9/dd_crash_incoming_real_talk/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) I appreciate the support and engagement. \n\nHere\u2019s my final hurrah. Zillow ($Z) is crashing here soon. I\u2019m too tired for my typical TA novella, so here\u2019s the quick and dirty. \n\n1) Their house flipping model was not designed to withstand an economic downturn, much less be profitable in a stable economy (they lose money on every flip)\n\n2) Equity is way overvalued relative to peers or market. The 52 Week low ($29) was only 5 months ago, and it\u2019s currently sitting over $40. Housing market about to get fucked, and Zillow holding the bag. 33% over recent bottom is absurd. The world is burning. \n\n3) In a recession, people will look to refi vs buy, and the market will stagnate. \n\n4) There\u2019s some in depth TA that helps explain it if you go looking. \n\nI\u2019ve taken roughly $80k off the table, and all in (with proof in first link) with the remaining ~$80k on 3/20 $45 Puts and 4/17 $40 Puts. When this dips under $30 I\u2019ll flip for an additional gain over $200k. \n\nBeen a fun and wild ride these last few weeks.
