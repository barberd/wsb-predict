{"id": "fvfitp", "title": "Zoom", "selftext": "*trying again due to reddit seizure \n\nHi friends. I've talked about this in discord a few times over the weekend but wanted to make an actual post to echo the sentiment of folks seeing the Zoom bubble. It's [CEO is a moron](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-04/zoom-ceo-messed-up-as-trolls-invade-a-coronavirus-haven-wsj) but acknowledged the fuck up. The [privacy risks](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/03/thousands-zoom-video-calls-left-exposed-open-web/) are through the roof. [New York already dropped them](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/04/us/nyc-schools-zoom-online-security/index.html). \n\nYou know this, it's all been posted here before. What you may not know is [Zoom has shitty encryption, lied about it, and is handing out encryption keys from China](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/zoom-meetings-weakly-encrypted-and-get-keys-from-china-546038). Even then it may have been posted here I didn't check because I'm retarded.\n\nWhat does this really mean, though? I work in the InfoSec community. My little company is pulling thousands of Zoom contracts for DoD contractors amid privacy concerns. There are strict guidelines for transmission of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) - which encompasses controlled technical information (CTI) and covered defense information (CDI). I, as an InfoSec nerd, cannot allow insecure transmission of stuff that fits into any of the above criteria, so I'm out. Several of my fellow CISO nerds are doing the same and going to Microsoft Teams in GCC or GCC High. Some will have to stay with Zoom because Skype in GCC/High does not support PSTN (telephone shit) currently and presumably won't because PUBLIC is part of the acronym. \n\nIt wouldn't surprise me if the US Gov't, at some point in the distant future because they move at a fucking glacial pace, mandates that contractors cannot use Zoom because of their shitty encryption. Unless Zoom gets their shit together soon, this shit is going down hard. Like somewhere in the 70-90 range in the next few months. Even if they get their shit together, the bad PR combined with people like me pulling out are going to make their Q2 earnings lower, I think.\n\nBut what the fuck do I know I just do security shit I'm not a financial advisor.\n\nZM 5/15 $70-90p, premiums are stupid and that'll change tomorrow I'm sure\n\nPresumably, at least from my direct interactions with stuff, this will mean MSFT will get more money. MSFT is just like the big gay mouse, they're not great companies to bet against and we know MSFT will ultimately land on the other side of this just fine and the stonks go up. The real question is when. LEAPS on MSFT may not be a bad play either.", "created_utc": 1586100550.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fvfitp/zoom/", "is_self": true}
