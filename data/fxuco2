SPY up only 1,4% (atm) and you guys are bullish like psychos??", "selftext": "Ok just trying to open some eyes here on both sides...\n\nMain even of the day is the upset in unemployment by 1.6m (nobody talks about this) because the fed held on a good new ultimate that keeps burden the country even more...\n\nWhat was the impact of that?
