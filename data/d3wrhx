{"id": "d3wrhx", "title": "Countdown to FOMC", "selftext": "The Fed meets on September 18th and they will decide the Federal funds rate.   Currently we have a rate of 200-225 BPS.  A month ago the probabilities of the Federal funds rate after the market was:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n150-175 BPS: 3.8%\n\n175-200 BPS: 96.2%\n\n200-225 BPS (current): 0.0\n\nYesterday (Thursday) this was:\n\n150-175 BPS: 0.0%\n\n175-200 BPS: 87.7%\n\n200-225 BPS  (current): 12.3%\n\nAt the close of today:\n\n150-175 BPS: 0.0%\n\n175-200 BPS: 79.6%\n\n200-225 BPS  (current): 20.4%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't see how they can possibility cut rates if we make new ATH's before September 18th.  TLT got crushed today.  As the long-end of the yield curve increased this week, does that give the Fed permission to not cut?  How does the market react in that even?  \n\nMy trading Thesis (if no news this weekend):\n\nIt will be a great week to look at the technicals.  Seems like we could have set a double-top.  I expect relatively flat week until the 18th.  I'll play hedged positions short /ES (short /ES contracts, long SPX upside calls), particularly if we make ATH's by the 18th.    \n\nThen they eye will be on the trade talks.   No deal/No progress and we retest August lows.  Trade deal, new ATHs.  I have no idea how the markets react to an 'intermediate deal'. \n\nHow are you playing next week?", "created_utc": 1568414040, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d3wrhx/countdown_to_fomc/", "is_self": true}
