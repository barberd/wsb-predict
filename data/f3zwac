I'm hearing valuations of 50B, 100B, etc. Currently it is valued at 5B per the ticker value. \n\nSo lets do some math here.\n\n5B valuation - company has 120M in potential revenue for the 600 customers (250k per ticket).\n\nThey will probably begin flying something after July since they are trying to reserve the first flight for Sir Richard for his 70th birthday, so I'd imagine the 600 pre-ordered customers will have to fly thereafter which should take up the rest of the year. \n\nAt 5B, they are valued at almost 42x their revenue. That's at roughly $30 per share.\n\nThen there's raging bull over there with 750k in options talking about seeing $50 end of this year, that's 8.3B valuation. only 69x their revenue. YEAH 69.\n\nThen we have retard analyst over there telling his relatives to buy up those calls to make them proud on television talking about $60PT. Which is an 82x revenue.\n\nJust think about it. Space tourism is big and all, but SPCE cannot scale like BlueOrigins or SpaceX. The moment these guys IPO, these analysts and fake bulls gonna hop right over like a gold digger.\n\nAnd, even at 5B valuation, let's say a reasonable revenue forward is 20x. That's still 500M in revenue that it has to do. Do the math again, based on the 250k pricetag, that's about 2000 passengers a year. \n\nHow many millionaires you think gonna drop 250k on a couple minute trip in space each year? 2000?", "created_utc": 1581718954, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3zwac/spce_its_just_math/", "is_self": true}
