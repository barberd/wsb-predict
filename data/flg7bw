{"id": "flg7bw", "title": "Poor woman's put on BBBY", "selftext": "BBBY, Bed Bath and Beyond...\n\nBought 4/9 $5 puts for $0.80, and 5/1 $5 puts for $1.20. Last market price was $5.58 as of 3/19   12:20PM PST. \n\nI only had a couple hundred to invest, so I was looking for cheap puts I could buy. Everyone is looking at the restaurants, airlines, etc. so I decided to look into less popular options and think I found one.\n\nI found a Bed Bath and Beyond store and there was an unusual amount of cars parked there. Turns out, the cars were actually for the Target next door... **this was a few years ago.** Curiosity got the best of me, so I looked inside the store to see who shopped there... it's bad sign when there are as many store employees as there are customers in the store.\n\nReasons why I bought puts here:\n\n* I don't know anyone who buys stuff at BBBY, except maybe one person who is very well off. Even then, how often do you buy bedding?! *Does anyone here buy anything from BBBY?*\n* Puts were \"affordable\" for me\n* EPS (trailing 12 mo.) is -6.269 (negative), P/E (trailing 12 mo.) is 0.0x\n* Next earnings date is 4/8, which I expect to be abysmal. Timing of the puts 4/9 is right after, and 5/1 for good measure\n* I think stock prices will drop even more because we are just starting to quarantine\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: *Does anyone here buy anything from BBBY?   If so, could someone tell me what the \"beyond\" part is?*", "created_utc": 1584646577.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flg7bw/poor_womans_put_on_bbby/", "is_self": true}
