Most investors have been going on the premise that coronavirus has been here since around December and there were many, maybe a million or more, asymptomatic cases that never even had to call their doctor, meaning coronavirus was just the flu bro and really a nothingburger.  Guess what... that is now proven false!  **It's not priced in.**\n\nWe are quarantined until there are real therapeutics or a vaccine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* SPY $70 JULY PUTS\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe its good people are in denial so toilet paper goes back on the shelves since people will stop hoarding it, but I think the market will drop another 30% and maybe more after the market goes high enough for big fish to take their new short positions. We have the greatest economy the world has ever seen... without coronavirus.\n\nP.S. the revised R0 of COVID-19 is now 5.7, almost double what it was before this is also not priced in.\n\n**Epidemiologist Source for CDC revision of R0 being 5.7:** [https://twitter.com/DrEricDing/status/1247872359312351232](https://twitter.com/DrEricDing/status/1247872359312351232)\n\nAn R0 of 1 is really bad. 1 person infects 1 person and on it goes until mitigation starts.  Reason even with the wrong infection rate COVID-19 was given it was still worse than the flu's R0 of 1 is because of the complication rate; it's 10% in some areas like Italy.  So 5.7 is much worse because relaxing social distancing or quarantine means 1 person could infect \"5.7\" people before they are showing symptoms.\n\nP.P.S.  Cognitive-bias occurring in the culture, particularly normalcy bias, cognitive-dissonance, as well as a very understandable grief cycle ([https://psychcentral.com/lib/the-5-stages-of-loss-and-grief/](https://psychcentral.com/lib/the-5-stages-of-loss-and-grief/)).\n\nP.P.P.S. oh and before you say, \"B-b-but that's not what the scientists say! It *is* priced in!\" here is an epidemiologist thread on New York's epidemic started by a Europe case in March.  This is without a doubt the worst news yet to come out from COVID-19 stories:  [https://twitter.com/DrEricDing/status/1248075521910607872](https://twitter.com/DrEricDing/status/1248075521910607872)\n\nThis means 1 case was able to infect that many people in a month.  \n\nAnd F U China.", "created_utc": 1586404348.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxlbll/absolutely_not_priced_in_ny_outbreak_originated/", "is_self": true}
