{"id": "bsahvi", "title": "40 Suggestions To New Day Traders", "selftext": "For those of you interested in day/scalp/swing trading, please consider the following 40 suggestions:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) Do not trade after/pre-market on news.  In fact, stay way from trying to trade during this time.\n\n2) Do not try to guess earnings calls and take big positions just prior to close.\n\n3) Do not trade on IPO day.  Most IPOs will gap up extremely fast in the first few minutes and then sell down.  Don't try to chase them.  If you must, set a few limit orders from the IPO price up every $0.50 in a ladder to try to catch the initial orders before they pop.  If you get them, close them out once you get the high. But really, you should just avoid trading on IPO day.  If you really want the stock, let it settle down for a few hours and buy it to hold long.\n\n4) Biotech companies trading for under $5 can often betray you.\n\n5) Set your OCO (One Cancels Others) on all orders.  Entry order, stop market/limit loss, and your plan for exit.\n\n6) The first 15 minutes of the trading day are very volatile.\n\n7) Trying to trade against the overall direction of the market is often disastrous. If SPX is bleeding out, why would you go long on a tech stock?\n\n8) Do not lose more than 1% of your total account value on a single day trade.\n\n9) Be patient in taking your profit but do not get too greedy and lose out on profit.  You're paid to sit and be patient.\n\n10) Call up your broker upon first deposit and request $$500-1000 in free trades and negotiate a lower trading commission.\n\n11) Usually 99% of all information about a stock is already priced into the stock.  Because there are millions of other people out there trading this same equity, the collective knowledge of everyone is built into the price action. Rarely do you have an inside scope that others don't.\n\n12) Trade to make money and not to be right. If you hit your stop loss, move on and don't dwell on it.  Don't hold on to it intraday, weekly, and forever and see it all go away.  You don't know more than everyone else.  As much as you hope, it may not ever recover.\n\n13) Careful buying too many shares on a short term day trade. You may find the market maker plays games with you and makes it hard to get all those shares out by repositioning their orders above/below the bid/ask spread.  Keep an eye on the volume and try to trade stocks in excess of 500k daily volume.  Try to buy and sell using limit orders and not market orders to avoid slippage.  Learn about the 'Sell 1/2' buttons, flatten, reversal, and other advanced trading order buttons to help you adjust your position and get in and out in a timely fashion.\n\n14) It's important to learn about technical analysis, chart patterns, studies, etc.  Also learn/find good scanners.\n\n15) VWAP is important because big firms pay their trades to enter/exit positions close to the VWAP and bonus them based on this.\n\n16) Consider trading with a paper account starting at $20k so you're under the PDT (Pattern Day Trader) rule and have to learn to make some smart trades / swing trades to get over $25k.  Once you're at $25k, try to grow 1-5% per week.  If you can get above $100k in 6 months, move to real money.\n\n17) Learn what the short float is.  Learn about low float.  Learn about short squeeze.\n\n18) Learn about the relationships between options trading volume and their underlying stock.\n\n19) DO NOT TRADE OPTIONS UNTIL YOU HAVE SPENT AT LEAST 6 MONTHS STUDYING THEM.\n\n20) Do not think you have money to lose in your account. The key to building wealth is to preserve it. Don't get into the habit of thinking you can lose a grand because you have 30. You want to win always.\n\n21) Again, always go into a trade with a thesis as to why you're entering the trade, the price you buy at, your stop loss, and your profit taking. Stay true to this. Keep a journal of your trades. If the trade goes bad, study your thesis, learn more, and adjust. Be mechanical and not emotional.\n\n22) Control your emotions. NEVER REVENGE TRADE.\n\n23) Monday and Friday can be weird.\n\n24) Sometimes the best thing to do is sit it out for the day.\n\n25) Sometimes all you need is 1 trade a week.\n\n26) Hope doesn't grow your account.\n\n27) It is better to slowly grow your account to a Portfolio Margin account size ($150k) over a year or two than try to do crazy YOLO shit and blow out your account.  You could have been one of the best traders to ever exist if you just slowed down, relaxed, played it slow, and managed your risk.  This is your business.  This could provide for your family. This could give you freedom. Don't wreck your opportunity by blowing out your life savings.  Turn that life savings into a life of freedom.\n\n28) Do not borrow to trade.\n\n29) Always keep CNBC on in the background while you trade.\n\n30) Sleep well, eat well, de-stress well, and take breaks.\n\n31) If you're under 30 years old and you lose $100k, your life is not over. Stop trading and find another thing to do.  If you really want to get into trading again, it is worth spending a few years learning to be a trader and going back into the game with wisdom and knowledge then to keep throwing money away.\n\n32) If you're under 30 years, make your plan from now until 80.  Long term planning is good. Time is money. Time is power.  Plan where you want to be every 5 years. Set goals. Chase goals.\n\n33) If you like pussy, find pussy that is not crazy. Crazy pussy will make you trade crazy.\n\n34) Faith-based organizations can be grounding and usually have older financial dudes who can help you stay level.\n\n35) Unless you have made over $500k and have 5+ years of experience, DO NOT TALK ABOUT TRADING to your friends and family. You are not an expert. Expert comes with time and when you can show at least 1200%+ return.  Be humble.\n\n36) Do not raid your account to buy nice things.  Live small and within a budget so you can grow that portfolio to monster sizes and use it to grow even more.\n\n37) Get a good CPA / Enrolled Agent to help you with your taxes.  If you avoid paying taxes,  the IRS will goatse you deep.\n\n38) \"Chat With Traders\" videos on youtube is golden. Learn from those who came before you.\n\n39) If you're still reading, remember that only 4% of people who want to day trade make it more than 6 months.  You might just make it.\n\n40) Finally, do not cash out all your savings and quit your job to become a day trader.  You become a day trader after you've successfully day traded consistently for at least 3 years and have a strong and large portfolio that is at least $300k to allow you to trade up to $900k to $1.2m with portfolio margin.", "created_utc": 1558658351, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bsahvi/40_suggestions_to_new_day_traders/", "is_self": true}
