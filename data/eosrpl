They seem to be shuffling people around like a frenetic game of musical chairs.   \n\nThere was a guy named Jay Welker, but he somehow got MeToo'd into retirement because women complained.  Then there was a guy named Dean Junkans, but he, too, retired. \n\nThat left us with David Kowach, running \"WELLS FARGO ADVISORS\" with 1.6T or 1.9T in AUM.  But then I hear that he is also gone, moved over to \"community banking\" instead and leaving a guy named JIM HAYS in charge.  To top it all off there are CIO types named Erik Davidson and Jonathan Weiss, and god only knows what they do. \n\nCan someone provide me with an up-to-date Org Chart for those guys?  And also while you're at it, esplain to me the difference between a \"wirehouse\" and a private bank. \n\nOK, thanks.", "created_utc": 1579041170, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eosrpl/what_is_the_difference_between_a_wirehouse_and_a/", "is_self": true}
