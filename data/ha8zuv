You go for year long expiration, so options expiring from a year now. Then sell an ATM put spread of about 10 points, it will require about 1000 dollars for 1 spread contract. You would generate instantly a 40-50% return on your capital in the form of premium. So why does this work you ask? Because for the last 20 years there have been only 4 negative years in which your max loss is just 1000 dollars but 16/20 years you would make 400-500 dollars each year. This over time has a positive rate of return. Viola income generation from options the safe way.\n\nBut do realize this, this is for income generation purpose only, not compound interest. Do not roll your profits into next years bet because at some point you are going to lose it all. If you use 10k this year, next year use 10k again, and repeat and over time you will win.\n\nGod take me away now.", "created_utc": 1592330067.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ha8zuv/god_has_sent_me_to_help_you/", "is_self": true}
