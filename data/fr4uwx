China faked out virus recovery statistics just to force workers to go back to work so fast, so 90-95% of factories in china are already functioning normally\n2. The virus spread in the US/Europe are way faster and most non-essential/consumer focused businesses/factories are already closed before April.\n\nFirstly, why would China needs to fake out virus stats to force workers to go back to work?\n\nThe answer is rather simple, if they don't export shit to earn profits(foreign currency) they would face high inflation and would be unable to import necessary items such as oil, food which they couldn't make enough to satisfy internal consumption and to sustain its semi-closed economy.\n\nYou may remember that there is African swine fever virus problem back in Aug 2018, which hasn't disappeared till this day and has caused so much havoc to China economy by inflating the price of pork from 10 to 30+ in 2019 and cause the overall inflation rate CPI in china to 5.2% in Feb 2020.

[here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-manufacturin/chinas-factories-reopen-only-to-fire-workers-as-virus-shreds-global-trade-idUSKBN21D0IG)  and  [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-26/the-second-virus-shockwave-is-hitting-china-s-factories-already)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo the government in china is facing a really tough situation with high inflation and low economic growth, this is likely the reason that china only give out news about a stimulus plan, but doesn't have any since the outbreak as pumping money into a high inflated economy would simply make inflation goes wild. [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-27/china-pledges-to-raise-fiscal-deficit-ratio-sell-special-debt)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn conclusion:\n\n1.There are so many migration workers traveling back to the factories which would likely to get shutdown anyway due to lack of orders from the west because of lock downs, so massive lay offs and unemployment\n\n2.Those people traveling across could increase the chance of a second outbreak (duh)\n\n3. China is already in a high inflation rate so they aren't likely to have any stimulus plans since they already have so many debts on building those useless ghost cities that no one is gonna buy!
