This economy is weak af and they should have been raising rates the past 2 years but no. Also dumbass in chief increased the deficit with his stupid ass tax cuts. If this is the beginning of a recession we\u2019re gonna experience a deleveraging. Shits gonna be worse than 2007. Rates have been low way too damn long and everybody is over leveraged. I hope you all have jobs that don\u2019t experience cyclical unemployment. Only advice I got is BUY THE FUCKING DIP! It might take a while to hit the bottom but we\u2019ll hit it eventually. Buy and hold or get some LEAPS. It won\u2019t be the end of the world but it\u2019s gonna fucking suck but we\u2019ll get through it.", "created_utc": 1565038268, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cmgs1r/here_comes_the_deleveraging/", "is_self": true}
