People will talk about this depression for generations. Process that. So when your dumb grandkid asks you what you did during the Covid-19 pandemic, you should not say you were a bull at the start of the bear market or at the start of the pandemic in the USA. \n\nHaving said that, I admit I have not been trading perfectly, but I have done very, very well up until now... I have previous posts that prove that. \n\nI see huge issues in liquidity, massive amount of bad news (which are not priced in because they are not in the media yet).... The expansion cycle is over, the corporate bond market will bleed, the valuations are still super high. \n\nDONT BE FOOLED BY THE BULL TRAP, WE WILL BE TRADING WITH WIDE SWINGS, SO PICK THE EASY TRADES.\n\nAlso don\u2019t marry your stocks, let that bitch go and join the winning \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b gang.
