The hype for the stock is there and its obviously only going to pick up more hype this coming year when he goes into space followed by all the movie stars that signed up like Brad Pitt and potentially many others like matthew mcconaughey and sandra bullock, being the little weebs that they are, who want a more authentic cos play experience than what the green screens of holly wood can offer them.\n\nEverybody knows that Branson is best friends forever with Obama, which means that its very possible that we'll even see Obama up in a Virgin Galactic while wearing that under armor onesie.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my bull thesis is to buy $10,000 worth of SPCE LEAPS expiring Jan 15, 2021 at the $35 strike for $60 each. So that would be 10,000 / 60 = 154 calls.\n\nSo either SPCE will not move up much or come down or it will go into orbit to $200 by the end of the year and you'll make 154 calls \\* (100 shares)  (200 stock price - 35 strike) = 154 \\* 100 \\* 165 = 1,001,000\n\nOne Million and One Thousand!!!\n\nObvious Asymmetric returns!", "created_utc": 1580527472, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ex01zh/spce_and_asymmetric_returns_thesis/", "is_self": true}
