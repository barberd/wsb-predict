{"id": "ffdpsy", "title": "I remember a time when everyone was bearish.", "selftext": "Was about 11 years ago, March 6, 2009. Even after that bottom, for a good 2-3 years, so many people were STILL calling for the apocalypse; they lost so much money, I did too for a while. They had all the fundamental reasons things would go down, and they were really good reasons. Multi-trillions in derivatives that could still go belly up etc.  They ended up being wrong.\n\nI wonder how long we can go up and people will still be bearish about coronavirus not being priced in?  Seems like a lot. That's a lot of money the market can take from new millennial/Z bears that just started getting enough money to start trading. \n\nOne thing about coronavirus as we'll find out with more and more cases, is that the morbidity is going to drop and it won't last more than another month or two.\n\nLast I checked, the stock market is supposed to look into the future beyond just a month or two. Might want to consider that. :D\n\nOf course, we still very well might test the earlier lows for the major indexes, but I'd be buying a lot more at that point... but given how bearish almost everyone is, now's the time to start buying for me!\n\nOn Friday I got VIX 30 puts for 3/25, BAC 4/3 28, CCL 30 3/20, RCL 70 3/20, DAL 48 3/20, JPM 120 4/3, and QQQ 4/3 calls.   \nI'll probably get some puts on oil and oil companies though, might wait for a bounce. \n\nIf the coronavirus isn't the apocalypse and oil stays cheap af, that will be a huge catalyst for the next bull wave.\n\nWu-Tang bitches.", "created_utc": 1583679924.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffdpsy/i_remember_a_time_when_everyone_was_bearish/", "is_self": true}
