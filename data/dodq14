I have information on your beloved stock. If you are a true baller or want literally free money you will make this play. \n\nSell/write the shit out of the Nov 1 28-29's Puts or less than the 28's if you are a big pussy. \n\nIf you do this you will make hella tendies for you and your multiple wives and have a lil yachty for all them. \n\nHere is my analysis. AMD even on earnings does not move more than 15% to the downside unless AMD says something like we are out of the servers business. **Then you should write the fuck out of calls to make up for the mountains of losses you will accrue.** What you are going to hear is they either hit 50%YoY Growth rate or they didnt. People will be pissed if missed but, your guidance will talk about the gains to be had with the new next gen consoles coming out. Contracts that have already been procured with MSFT and Sony. It will add fat stacks to the gaming revenue. As long as cloud server jawns are mentioned and mostly in line than selling puts is free money.  \n\nPlz feel free to send me money for the advising", "created_utc": 1572290398, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dodq14/bulls_ahead_on_amd_earnings/", "is_self": true}
