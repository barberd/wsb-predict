{"id": "flcdng", "title": "Loading up on bear positions tomorrow morning", "selftext": "I'm thinking next week is going to be bad number wise for coronavirus and folks will panic. We might be seeing a little rally today and perhaps tomorrow morning but by tomorrow afternoon, folks will want to unload and not hold over the weekend. And then next week, panic will increase and prices will fall (presenting good buying opportunities). The following week, things might steady and mid term improvement to follow.\n\nSound reasonable? I'm loading up on some Apr 3 bearish debit put spreads tomorrow morning.   Haven't quite figured out exactly which companies but likely \n\n* BBY\n* SHOP - it can't even move up well today.  Probably great as a longer term long position but not short term\n* ARE & O - these are office and retail REITs that I honestly don't know much about but haven't really tumbled like the other ones.\n* Marketing consultant company - any recommendations?  I think advertising will suffer due to the virus as companies will move things digital and in house for the short term\n\nAs for late next week, I'm going to long AMZN through to their earnings and beyond.  This is a good one to dollar cost average for the next couple of months.", "created_utc": 1584633557.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flcdng/loading_up_on_bear_positions_tomorrow_morning/", "is_self": true}
