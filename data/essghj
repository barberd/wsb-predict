Face masks in general are heavily used in Asia, even without the Coronavirus scare and on a normal winter day you could see a good portion of China or Japan wearing them. Now with the increase demand they are apparently all being sold out. Not only that vendors and family are buying them from pharmacies and even home Depot in the U.S. to send back to China. \n\nSo im short, APT and LAKE for at least the next few months or so? With yesterday's dip it might be a good time to enter. I entered early yesterday and still at a deficit but will just hold on to it. \n\nI also bought puts on WYNN. Macau's traffic was probably slowed by the situation in Hong Kong in 2019 and the virus scare couldn't have helped. \n\nThanks for reading.", "created_utc": 1579782793, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/essghj/coronavirus_extra_case_for_apt_and_lake/", "is_self": true}
