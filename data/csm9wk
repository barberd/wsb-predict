If you haven\u2019t heard, Amazon has partnered with kohl\u2019s for returns to make it extremely easy for the customer and boost sales for kohl\u2019s. \n\nYou don\u2019t need to do anything other than bring your item you\u2019re returning to a K and they do the rest of the packaging and shipping.  With each return you also get kohl\u2019s coupons for 25/35% off that last 7 days.\n\nOne woman in front of me at least 70+ in age finished what seems to be her first return as she left the cashier with glee.  The other 70+ year old woman behind me began to cheer as well and I found myself joining in on the excitement.   \n\nBefore you knew it the two 70 year old women were jumping with joy with how easy it was to return.  In their own words \u201cI was in shock, I saw kohl\u2019s and said to myself I have one of those nearby!\u201d.    \n\nSeconds later after one of the women left, the other proceeded to jump on the phone and call what seems to be her financial driver and reminded them to buy khols stock.  I could tell she wants IN.    \n\nThink about it, all these khols queens want these sweet TENDIES to spend along with their COUPONS.    \n  \nLONG $KSS. \n\nEasy. fucking. clap.", "created_utc": 1566244061, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/csm9wk/live_khols_kss_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
