{"id": "brf9jv", "title": "$AOS US Company with Chinese Funny Money", "selftext": "**Intro**\n\nAt first glance, AOS looks like a pretty boring member of the S&amp;P 500 that produces water heaters primarily in the US  [https://www.aosmith.com/](https://www.aosmith.com/) (Probably lost half of you here).  What they're doing in China and India is where it gets juicy.  \n\n**J Capital Short**\n\nJ Capital specializes in primary research in China into companies with dubious numbers and aims to profit off of their decline. They conduct Chinese macro search as well as deep dives into individual companies and industry reports. Last Thursday, they released a 66-page report on $AOS (front page of [https://www.jcapitalresearch.com/](https://www.jcapitalresearch.com/) ), leading to a $4 contraction in share price Thursday and eventually a low of $40.34 in the following week. It's 66 pages so I'll condense it to eight points:\n\n1. Management Incompetence\n2. Partnership with UTP to hide losses, report artificially high China numbers, and high amount of AOS's cash, 84%, tied up in China with many defaulting distributors\n3. Decline in China Revenues related to new market entrants\n4. China counterparts trading at much lower multiples than China portion of AOS valuation\n5. Loss of direct sales to online sales in China\n6. Trade War headwinds related to China \n7. Slower domestic growth related to slowdown in US housing\n8. Murky Accounting Entries related to China\n\ntldr: *$AOS Price at time of report:* $47.92 *J Capital Price Target:* $22.68\n\n**Spruce Point Capital**\n\nSpruce Point Capital is a hedge fund specializing in shorts that I knew nothing about before reading this Bloomberg article [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-05-20/the-tiny-activist-fund-that-reaped-24-return-by-unearthing-cockroaches](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-05-20/the-tiny-activist-fund-that-reaped-24-return-by-unearthing-cockroaches). Their founder, Jay Axler, got pushed out of IB in the financial crisis and decided to rage against the machine by shorting companies, to a ton of success.  Their Twitter ( [https://twitter.com/sprucepointcap](https://twitter.com/sprucepointcap)) contains all of his coverage on $AOS at the moment but I'll include some of his points not already covered by J Capital.\n\n1. $AOS growth has primarily come from China. Spinning their slowdown in China to macro concerns when it is really competition in the sector.\n2. Omission of China disclosures in recent financial reports\n3. Move of $AOS holders from fundamental investors to passive vehicles, quant funds etc.\n4. Recent acquisitions sign of lack of confidence in Chinese business\n5. Losing money in India even after 10 years, auditors citing insufficient quantitative details about fixed assets\n6. Evidence of sandbagging revenues and then later revising revenues higher\n7. Gross margins and EBITDA margins substantially higher than similar competitors that have seen a contraction in margins related to an increase in the cost of inputs\n8. China Capex consistently underestimated\n9. CFO resigning amid China revenue revisions\n10. High Price-Target regional banks with little-to-no Chinese presence\n11. Smith family controls 2/3 of board and majority of voting power; insiders own only 1.7% of shares\n\ntldr: *Current $AOS price:* $44.60 *SPC Low PT:*$17.71 *SPC High PT: 27.27*\n\n**Risks I See:** Not a ton of negative catalysts in near-term, could see quants and other passive funds picking up $AOS following contractions. Trade War end could mean surge upward for $AOS. \n\n**Short Interest:** Short interest currently 3.68% of float, according to  [http://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AOS.htm](http://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AOS.htm).
