{"id": "djnkzp", "title": "Speculative play on the housing and renovation recovery", "selftext": "**Thesis:** With stable employment numbers, low interest rates (and dropping) and the low housing supply, I think housing and renovation stocks will outperform over the next year. Read this article for the full these on which this assumption is based. https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephenmcbride1/2019/10/14/the-biggest-housing-boom-in-history-has-just-begun/#75d5ba2825b0\n\n**Current trend:** HD and LOW are the two biggest names in renovation. Their stocks have performed really well over the last year. I think they can increase again next year, but realistically, they are huge companies and their stocks won't double or triple. I want a home run.\n\nIn housing, NVR, PHM and BZH are the big boys and they have done well so far, but again, I don't see them doubling or tripling from here.\n\n**My Bet:** The most downtrodden overlooked and unloved stock in the renovation space is Lumber Liquidators (LL). Short interest is over 40%. The company has sucked ass for like 5 years. But recently, Whitey Tilson (hedge funder) went long the stock and raves about it as a turnaround play. Also, last month, the company founder (Tom Sullivan) made a play to take the company private, but in the end, he bailed. \n\nFor LL, the last few years have seen loses. Most of that was because of product issues from 2015 and lawsuits. But now, the lawsuits are all done and 2020 should be profitable. \n\nTariffs might also ease up, which will instantly make the company more profitable. Right now there are 25% tariffs on most of the company's products. If that drops, it's all profit. \n\nThe sales comps for next year are easy too. With some tailwind in renovation and housing, these guys can post 4% growth in same store sales. \n\nLL is not the company it once was, but I think the risk/reward on this play is worth it. Plus, I work as a contractor and have worked at LL before, and I can see that things are moving in the right direction at the company. Name recognition is still high and the products are good. \n\nI'm putting 15k in the shares and I am also buying the Jan 2021 calls, 10$ strikes, at $2.50. If the shares go to 25, I will 6x my money. Total investment $20k. That's my bet and I'm stickin' to it.", "created_utc": 1571405630, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/djnkzp/speculative_play_on_the_housing_and_renovation/", "is_self": true}
