Earnings 6/8 Pre-market", "selftext": "**Position**: [10x 9/18 $90c](https://i.imgur.com/vOA4Hfs.png) (I'm long on them, but might grab a few FDs later in the week)\n\nCurrent days to cover: [7](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/daystocover.asp)  (short interest is decreasing)\n\nWho the fuck is Thor Industries? They're an RV conglomerate that owns a fuckload of the market.\n\n**Thesis:** Beckys in Covid states needs a vacation, she wants to go glamping with her mountain bike and see if her Peloton training did anything. Optimistic outlook that RV season is going to be extended this year as popularity rises and vacation plans change will cause a massive short squeeze if short volume remains high. At the worst, I think we'll experience a nice run up this week.\n\n**Where I need help in this DD:** Can anyone dig into their [10Q](https://s23.q4cdn.com/270606922/files/doc_financials/2020/q2/ce64270e-7f1e-4cc1-b256-22429bbb154a.pdf) and see if there is anything I'm missing? [Here is a Q/A doc as well](https://s23.q4cdn.com/270606922/files/doc_financials/2020/Q2/2Q-FY2020-Q-A-(3-6-20)-Final.pdf)\n\nThere was also some insider buying when THO was down in the 30s.\n\n**Everything under this is just my bullshit and notes. Read it if you want to read.**\n\nZScalar just had a short squeeze with a short float ratio of \\~10%, $THO currently has a short float ratio of \\~15%.  Both companies are benefiting from the changing times. If people don't want to fly, RV/road trips will increase in popularity.\n\n$THO Thor Industries owns 20 different brands of recreational vehicles. If you've been following $CWH, which is a shitty website that sells RV/camping supplies, they sell products from Thor Industries.\n\n**Peer group:** Winnebago Industries (\u201cWGO\u201d), LCI Industries (\u201cLCII\u201d) and Spartan Motors Inc. (\u201cSPAR\u201d).\n\n* *Winnebago* is interesting too, but they are smaller cap, lower volume, and less shorted.\n* *LCI Industries* makes manufactured homes so I'm not interested in them, I want someone who is solely RVs.\n* *Spartan Motors* makes fleet emergency response vehicles and parcel delivery vehicles and shit, not interested.\n\nAdditionally, all of these guys have less volume\n\n[Retail Ownership](https://robintrack.net/symbol/THO) is not that high, only 1250 Robinhood users are on this meanwhile [CWH](https://robintrack.net/symbol/CWH) has 4k owners. Here is [ZScalar](https://robintrack.net/symbol/ZS) which had a huge short squeeze, you can see that Robinhood users were totally asleep on this company.**Google Trends DD**\n\n* [Glamping Interest](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=GLAMPING)\n* [Camping Interest](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=US&q=camping)\n* [Recreational Vehicle 5 yr trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=US&q=%2Fm%2F01lgkm) | [Worldwide](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=%2Fm%2F01lgkm)\n* [RV Rental](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=US&q=RV%20Rental) | [Worldwide](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=rv%20rental)\n* [Popular Thor RV brand interest](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=Airstream,Jayco)\n* [FL](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=US-FL&q=%2Fm%2F01lgkm), [NY](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=US-NY&q=%2Fm%2F01lgkm), [TX ](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=US-TX&q=%2Fm%2F01lgkm), [CT](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=US-CT&q=%2Fm%2F01lgkm), [NJ](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=US-NJ&q=%2Fm%2F01lgkm), [CA Interest](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=US-CA&q=%2Fm%2F01lgkm)\n\n[GoRVing Subreddit DD](https://subredditstats.com/r/GoRVing)\n\n* In 2019 it took 9 months to gain 6.5k subs\n* in 2020 they did this in 5 months\n\n[Recent Thor news](https://www.reuters.com/article/brief-thor-industries-says-production-fa/brief-thor-industries-says-production-facility-in-uk-is-expected-to-open-in-mid-june-idUSFWN2DB0FN) \\- lots of cool stuff in this article, the 2 big points for me are in bold.\n\n* biz open late April and all of May\n* strong *early start* to RV selling season prior to Covid\n* dealer inventories were ready for Spring selling season at the start of the year\n* strong demand from independent dealer base\n* some US dealers experiencing low inventories\n* thor ramped up demand to address higher than anticipated demand\n* **Q3 RESULTS WERE CERTAINLY NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY COVID-19**\n   * this was one of the only alarming things i've found\n* everyone with salary cuts returning to work at full price including board of directors\n* **THOR INDUSTRIES INC - REPAYING $250 MILLION DRAW BASED ON INCREASED CONFIDENCE IN OUTLOOK**\n   * but this made me feel better\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[rant](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoRVing/comments/fwj7af/rant_as_someone_who_lives_in_a_rural_area_stay/) I found from someone pissed about all the RVs bringing Coronavirus to their rural community\n\n[RVs brought the virus to Bishop California](http://www.thundercling.com/2020/03/the-pandemic-comes-to-bishop-a-small-climbing-community-struggles-beneath-the-weight-of-covid-19/)\n\n[RV manufacturers qualified as essential workers](https://www.wndu.com/content/news/RV-manufacturers-considered-essential-businesses-according-to-RVIA--569100131.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSeeking Alpha article reaffirming my thesis (link banned on WSB)\n\n* Thor leads the industry with 45.1% share of the North American Towables market\n   * from the research i found, it looks like towables are selling the fastest, which makes sense because they're cheaper.\n\nThor provided employees with protective equipment while reopening [here](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rv-industry-leader-thor-industries-provides-business-update-301040430.html)\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1590889854.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gtqges/thor_industries_tho_short_squeeze_earnings_68/", "is_self": true}
