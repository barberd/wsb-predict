GM are selling a beat up plant to a shitty auto manufacturer. TT threw a piss fit when GM first closed the plant down, now they\u2019re selling it, so he\u2019s made it all about him and gave Workhorse a shout-out in the process. A bunch of hedge fund managers stopped blowing rails long enough to notice and pumped $47mil into the stock in a few hours.\n\nWorkhorse make delivery drones, a bunch of other retarded shit, and electric trucks. I\u2019m told the W-15 does 0-60 in 5.5 seconds, but it looks like it\u2019ll repel pussy at the speed of light so who cares. Plus Workhorse are in fucking Ohio. \n\nFinally, they borrowed $35 mil in January (I\u2019m guessing to buy the plant?) but reported less than $400k in revenue in Q1.\n\nThis feels like a heartbreak waiting to happen. The auto industry in general is flailing about like a frog on fentanyl I don\u2019t see how the price can be sustained at this level, I don\u2019t care how many scalextric tractors they make.\n\nSHORT $WKHS (for you autists who fuck with options, I can\u2019t help you - I\u2019m predicting a crash by Friday, Monday latest, but it\u2019s your parents money not mine, lose it any way you like)", "created_utc": 1557360858, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bmcyww/wkhs_penny_stock_up_200_today_because_of_a_trump/", "is_self": true}
