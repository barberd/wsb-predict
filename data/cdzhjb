I don't think that with the increased competition it will be able to sustain the growth needed to keep it's high PE/value.  I think puts are the right call.  19th puts need 3.5% drop, might cut it close.  is something like january 20 - $300 puts a safer play if this tanks to 230 in 5 months or should i go even farther out?
