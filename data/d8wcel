These fucks are bound to ask themselves \"what the fuck am I watching\" at some point\n\nThis + the existing star wars fatigue (see articles about galaxy's edge being empty at disneyland) will kill this fucking zombie of a franchise for good for at least half a decade. Disney execs will contribute to this by flipping out and going after the people who steered the new movies in the direction they went\n\nAdd to this the hit they're taking from underpricing Disney+ and a post-endgame Marvel cinematic universe and shit has the potential to sour. MCU running out of steam has the potential to be the bigger issue here but I do not see that as likely as they've generally been more competent with those movies.\n\nStill not convinced? DIS is up like 300% since 2011 and this entertainment shit is bound to bleed when we stop being in \"\"late cycle\"\". The thing is still dancing around Endgame highs and they won't be releasing a movie at that level anytime soon.", "created_utc": 1569373991, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d8wcel/ultra_autistic_dd_short_disney_latest_sw_leaks/", "is_self": true}
