This market can only get *better* with a Trump tweet. If he strikes a deal with China, natty gas will rise. If he doesn't strike a deal with China, natty gas will simply not rise as much as it could. \n\nFor those of you in Florida, I really only care about grandma. TODAY, it may feel warm. You're not wearing a jacket in your living room unable to turn on your heat because you GUH'd up earlier in the season. Fuck you. Put on a jacket and grab some sterno to heat up your last tendies before your margin call comes due. I want to know how grandma is feeling. If she's cold, grabbing a jacket to go out, or turning on her heater, that's your signal. WHY? I don't look at the daily forecast for sweet, smooth-burning natty gas. I look at the 10-14 day chart because $UGAZ tracks natty gas futures. That's right retards. You too can play the futures market in a really roundabout way because you can't afford the margin required to enter. It is fucking *cold* and the injection cycle is over this week. I expect a bullish weekly natural gas report this Thursday at 10:30AM EST. Here is the LINK: http://ir.eia.gov/ngs/ngs.html It updates at 10:30AM EST every Thurs.\n\nThe old and decrepit grandmas rule natural gas in Florida because they literally have thin skin. Trust me, I'm in GA and a week ago my grandmother paid two inspectors $140 to ensure the furnaces and the natural gas heaters were working. Even after I verified that they were. \n\nDo NOT HOLD any of this shit. It's an ETN, there's decay, and $UGAZ isn't called The Widowmaker for no reason. Be careful retards. Don't GUH yourself with this one. \n\nTL;DR: Winter is coming and grandmas are terrified. BUY $UGAZ. \n\nCounterpoint, if winter is canceled buy $DGAZ.", "created_utc": 1572705936, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dql4ex/if_grandma_is_grabbing_her_jacket_in_florida_buy/", "is_self": true}
