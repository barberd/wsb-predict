People seem to think because other VC solutions exist that suck and don't get traction or because usage has ramped massively during COVID that for some reason is bearish. \n\nIn any event, here are the quick takeaways:\n\nMassive Q1 above anyone's wildest dreams: $330M in revenue vs. $200M consensus. Note, ZM's quarter ends in April that they reported. This means that some of March and all of April contributed somewhere around $130MM of revenue upside. Gee, what does that mean for a annual license/subscription business? $130MM / 6 weeks x 52 weeks = $1.2B of annualized new revenue above their trailing twelve months that has been secured. This figure excludes any customers added since 4/30 (and ZM has been the top downloaded app in May and June). \n\nSecond, customers greater than 10 employees grew 354% YoY (compared to 170% revenue growth). This means that the runrate of the business is substantially higher than what the quarterly revenue implies.\n\nThird, as of the latest quarter, ZM had 769 customers with more than $100K in revenue, an increase of 128 QoQ. In the most recent quarter, they added over 500 customers with annualized revenue runrates of over $100K. \n\nFourth - and one of the big underappreciated wildcards - international grew 246% YoY compared to 150% for North America. With COVID rampaging in India, LATAM, Russia, and other nations, this will provide momentum. As of now, OUS sales are only 25% of ZM's revenue despite being 85% of global GDP. \n\nFifth - guidance - they expect Q2 to have $0.44-0.46 / share earnings. That means they are runrating at nearly $2/share. They also assume $500MM in quarterly revenue for Q2. Let's take a look at that. In Q1, they expected $200M but delivered $330M based on a surge in business in the last month of the quarter due to COVID. Assuming no net new customers added in Q2 (and no churn - and new customers would more than offset churn), they should deliver $200M + ($130M x 3) = $600M in sales, again, assuming no net new business. Assuming the incremental $100M vs. guidance flows through at 60% to be safe, that's another $0.20/share. Now, how many new customers would they have added? Probably a fuckload, at least another $100-$150M worth of net new business. I would apply a 60% flow through on this as well incremental to mgmt's forecast. \n\nSo that means Q2 is likely in the range of $0.70-$1.00/share for earnings, taking FY2020 to somewhere between $2.20-$3.20/share of earnings compared to mgmt guidance of $1.50. This implies a runrate of $4.00 a share of earnings. \n\nSo, what's that worth? What PE ratio is appropriate for a massively ramping earnings play printing cash? Apply a 70x PE ratio on $4, you get $280. Apply 100x, you get $400. Apply 50x revenue multiple like other fast growth software companies, that gets you to $400+ as well. \n\n\"Muh competition\" and \"muh becky will stop using it\"\n\nThe concern around monthly prosumers is overstated (those with employees less than 10 people) - this only accounts for 30% of their revenue in the latest quarter, compared to 20% historically. This reflects in increase of about $30-$40M. The downside from churn is much more limited than people think.\n\nAlright guys, load up on all your puts! With COVID second wave on the way and it rampaging in the world's most populous country (India), now is the perfect time to go short!", "created_utc": 1592080593.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h8fad5/zm_market_still_undervaluing_the_upside_part_2/", "is_self": true}
