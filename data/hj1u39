Might as well tell you guys a story that has nothing to do with the title or maybe I just tell you what I\u2019m doing with my money or maybe both:\n\nI have 2 MGM covered calls at $20 and a Plug at $10. MGM isn\u2019t moving as much as I want it to and usually it\u2019s great to see the contracts expire but I was a dumbass and bought them out to 2022 before I actually learned anything bought options (I watched one video and thought I was a genius after). \n\nI got my MGM when it was down to $13 so I don\u2019t care if it shoots pass $20 because I\u2019ll still be making a good chunk of change.\n\nNow my post has some content.
