It got close to $100 and I make $8k. As a standard degenerate I instantly lost $4k in the next trade when SQ got close to $100 but crashed back down. \n\nSQ has the hardest ass limit of $100 price. Look at the graph, every fucking time it gets close to that 100 bucks per share it crashes down to shit after. It WILL NOT CROSS 100 bucks. YOU SHALL NOT PASS.\n\nSell at mid 80s if you have calls and it rallys next week. Get ready for the crash, it never can hold its dick up close to 100 bucks per share, in the high 90s it will crash down to shit.\n\nTL:DR SQ never reaches $100 per share, every single time it crashes down sell your calls before its too late and you get wiped out.", "created_utc": 1589496730.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gjx1x0/everyone_with_sq_calls_listen_up/", "is_self": true}
