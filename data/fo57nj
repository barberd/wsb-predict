The amount of fucking posts \"SPY is down why are my puts down and tendies missing?\" has gotten out of control. That being said options are incredible complex instruments and probably shouldn't be so easily accessible to a bunch of teenagers like ourselves. \n\nSecond, from the news/financial media down to people on this sub, everyone is fucking retarded. Idc if you're a HF manager or epidemiologist, no one has any fucking clue what's gonna happen. This is an unprecedented situation and the current extent of a highly interconnected and globalized economy will exacerbate it. For example, I work in insurance for small businesses ($50k-$25mm annual rev). My clients biggest concern isn't short term cash-- they can cut employees loose, negotiate rent, etc. What they're freaking out about is how businesses will react when this is all over. Will that warehouse still want to go forward with my client redoing their floors in June as expected? Will the 10 custom builders still be in business that give my client in supply distribution 90% of his revenue? It's the cyclical shit like that, if it lingers longer than expected, which is the biggest concern. \n\n**How we get tendies**: I think we see a dead cat soon and bounce back to 2750-3000. Almost every corner of the market is oversold technically speaking. This shit is obviously of major concern for the markets moving forward but we've gone down too far, too fast. IV is still too high to just buy puts ands the huge intraday swings can fuck  you if you're short.\n\nSo let's use a diagonal calendar spread. We **buy June 200 puts** and **sell April 190 puts**. We're then delta negative, theta positive and vega is somewhat offset from the short leg. **Worst case**, short leg expires worthless and we can either roll the short or exit for a marginal loss. If SPX stays in its range we stay about the same with a minimal P/L at April. **Best case**, we shit the bed further, if we blow past both strikes we're still looking at a decent profit.  \n\nCalendars give you the flexibility of time. I don't wanna time the market rn and get fucked bagholding expensive puts, but I don't feel comfortable with no downside exposure. This could be done more effectively with long ATM put and short OTM but I don't wanna commit that much BP. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR SPY April 190p/June 200p debit spread. Limits losses if deadcat bounce and still has upside if we make new lows. Roll @ exp or exit trade for marginal loss.**", "created_utc": 1585056955.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fo57nj/phds_money_managers_and_pe_investors_have_no_idea/", "is_self": true}
