{"id": "fokfc4", "title": "Opinion on grocery stores?", "selftext": "What are your guys opinions on grocery stores? Lots of grocery stores around me are having trouble keeping up with demand. The mass hoarding seems to have died down a little but I work at grocery store and we\u2019re still selling more than usual. We\u2019ve all seen the toilet paper memes and how people are hoarding everything.\n\nBut when I check stocks of popular stores (COST, KR, WMT) I see big fluctuations but pretty level. I mean I guess that\u2019s good when comparing to other things. But I would\u2019ve thought if would\u2019ve gone up more. \n\nShould we expect to see really good earnings for these companies in the near future? Is now the time to buy calls on these guys? I hope so because I already did. Just looking for some confirmation bias I guess? \n\nSFM $30c 9/18", "created_utc": 1585111903.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fokfc4/opinion_on_grocery_stores/", "is_self": true}
