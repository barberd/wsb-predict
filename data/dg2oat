But even so their current debt to market cap ratio is firmly above 100% without any end in sight. They can\u2019t lower their debt and their riskiness will raise their interest over time. They have no growth so it\u2019s probably a matter of time until they get bailed out. But GG equity holders.\n\nSoftBank. Just lol their stake in alibaba is worth 114b. Their current market cap is south of 70b. If any of their big holdings go boom they\u2019ll go boom. \n\nDB. Just lol matter of time until they get nationalized or re capped through bailout. Basically in the same situation as GE except Europeans cannot capitalism as well these days.", "created_utc": 1570733908, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dg2oat/softbank_ge_or_db_which_one_do_you_think_will_go/", "is_self": true}
