Use when you are as dumb or dumber than the market.  Also, Leaps are Options wearing Lingerie.  People like the guarantee of a longer play and find the Leap wrapping sexy.  Also, all leaps after removing the Lingerie become short term options.  The longer the Leap, the sexier the Lingerie, also the pricier the Option and really how much foreplay do you fricking need?\n\n**Short Term Puts / Calls -**  I know something the market doesn't or won't admit they know.  Use when you've done your DD or when you're smarter than the analysts.  Short term plays are one night stands with stocks.  Do you really want to go home with her/him?  How drunk are you right now...?\n\nSide note perception that's applicable ***\\*Right now Wall Street believes they are all Doctors and are using H1N1 and SARS as models for pricing while counting on the Fed and US government to bail them out if they are wrong.  So yes, they are playing a Win-Win game. If this sounds like 2008 to you... congrats you get to Turtle fan boy Squee while everyone on earth says you're a Turtle power, pizza eating, mouth breathing moron.***\n\n**Real World Analogy for Leaps and Short Term Puts / Calls** \\- Supply chains are screwed up from Covid 19 and at some point they are likely to impact Starbucks **SBUX** because coffee supplies run short.   However, I have no knowledge of Starbucks reserve levels or emergency operations plans when supply chains are disrupted.  I also don't know if they're willing to airdrop coffee from Rwanda to ensure they don't lose customers.  Further I don't know how long Covid 19 will impact their business (3 months, 6 months, a year, two years inline with Sequoia Capital's feedback to it's companies)\n\nWhat I do know is that SBUX is going to have lower foot traffic and I can confirm this by stalking their stores.  I do know that they have a shareholder meeting on 3/18.  I do know that they have Q2 earning reports on 4/28 and that they estimate $0.662 per share.\n\nSo this comes down to am I more confident in my uncertainties or my certainties.  Do I know more than the market or does the market know more than me?  For SBUX... I am going to split the position because I'm unsure but also this is r/WSB not  r/investing.   Further... I can't see SBUX providing an updated earnings guidance prior to March 18th.  So I'm more in the dark than an all knowing Lex Luthor pawning the Superman Analyst for yet another Kansas Farmboy moment.\n\nIn this case I'll do a split of 25/75 calls to Leaps.  I want the risk associated with SBUX getting killed on 3/18 or 4/28 but I also want the wins associated with long term Covid 19 beatings (Presented by Pokemon Koffing and Wheezing)  Positions **SBUX $67.5 Strike Put 5/15 expiration** and **SBUX $70 Strike 1/15/21 expiration.**  25/75 ratio for the investment and I'm a happy camper.\n\nHope that helps...
