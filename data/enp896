{"id": "enp896", "title": "PTON short interest and borrow rates update as of Friday", "selftext": "Fidelity has 0 shares to lend and is charging 12% on existing shorts. IB had about 150k shares to lend at 22.5% borrow rate. In past week the borrow rate creeped up from 17% to 22%. \nShort interest according to S3 is about 73%. I can update these numbers on Monday.\n\nFor those of you that follow my positions (hi grandma!) my PTON Jan 17th $35 calls are probably worth more as toilet paper than they are as derivatives. Not going to sell down here because either some amazing news happens and they go up (preannounce earnings/sub metrics?) or I get the full benefit as a tax write off for expiring worthless. Sucks to take a loss, but c\u2019est la vie. \n\nI have bought some Feb 21st $35 calls and some March $50 calls because I still think sub #\u2019s are going to kill it (see my prior posts on how I get there) and the short interest is above 70% and the borrow rate is going up.", "created_utc": 1578845229, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/enp896/pton_short_interest_and_borrow_rates_update_as_of/", "is_self": true}
