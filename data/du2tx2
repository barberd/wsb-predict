{"id": "du2tx2", "title": "Options for recently vaccinated - about TA", "selftext": "I decided on another educational post. This time about Technical Analysis . And as usual in layman terms.    \nTA is about looking on charts and justifying your trades with them. Nothing more, really. Nevertheless, some retards post their farewell screenshot and all you see is a downward line, like there was never a successful trade at all. This is wrong.   \nSo, TA to the rescue. \nTA = charts. First of all, charts should be right to start with. Nothing irks me more than bad charts like those on RH . Maybe it's my scientific training, but data points should have whiskers. And grid overlay should help. So change your chart settings to hi-lo-open-close. Or at least candlesticks.\nNow the second part - time range and scale.    \nTA = look back. You look back to get a sense on where the stock is going. If you want to trade today, you look on intraday chart with minute granularity (or 5 min) . If you making decision on when to get in and when to get out in general, 3 months of daily chart is a good start.  \nIt's especially critical for options as they have ability to expire.   \nNow the details.\nThere is plenty of indicators and I will only talk about few of them. You can pick your own and see what you like. It's only to make you feel good about your decision to waste money.\nAlso, none of them are fool-proof but they should increase your probability of successful trade which is currently a 0 anyway.     \n**Support/Resistance** - easy, look on 3+ month chart and see the highs and lows. Don't forget to enable whiskers. Explanation: it's crowd consensus on what is cheap and what is expensive in regard to the stock. It's kind of what Jesse Livermore was using - if it breaks through resistance it will likely go up, if it fall through support, it will likely go down more.      \n**RSI** (and **Slow Stochastic**) - I use them both. They show oversold /overbought levels. If stock goes up but RSI is still below 70 it is likely to keep going up. and same for the downhill. The beauty of this indicator is that it works on minute scale as well as on daily scale. So just before you click 'buy' button, look on RSI and see it way up, well, pause for 15 min. Could be misleading though but I rather miss a winning trade than get in the losing one, Most of the time I feel good for about 5 minutes after the trade.    \n**BB** (aka Bollinger Bands) - overlay them on the chart. Notice, that is stock is in upper band, it is staying there for a while, then it falls into lower band and stays there. It kind of helps you to figure out the trend. \"The trend is your friend\". Also notice how stocks bounce off the bottom line and top lines. Quite often coincides with RSI peaks and valleys.   \n**Fibs** (or Fibonacci). Well, it's more of pattern but some people swear by it. The pattern is simple: if stock goes up it goes in waves - 3 waves up that follows 2 waves down. Same in downhill. It should help you to slow down in your regrettable decision to sell or buy too early. It goes up - hold on, it will drop and then it will go up more. Some folks put numbers on how much and how far it would go. Don't put it in your head - those folks don't get rich.     \n**Other Patterns** - Head'n'Shoulders, Cup'n'Handle, Flag etc. Read about them , they work 100% in retrospect and a bit less in future prediction. There are plenty of websites around to teach you about them. I don't use them except to throw them in the parties like \"Triple Udder\", 'Dangling Dick' etc, even if they are not real patterns.    \n**Candlesticks** There is a great deal of Japanese wisdom in recognizing candlestick patterns. You can score big with Asian girls (and boys, who am i to judge) when you use them. Not sure you can get tendies though. But 'had sex, who cares'   \n*Real Advice I learned from Pros* : A quick estimate on picking up option expiration date. You pick OTM option and you need to know when it may reach it. Look on daily 3 mo chart, quickly see what is most common height of the candle (hi-lo difference). Then takes the difference between current price and strike price and divide by that average daily spread. That's how many days you need to get to your strike in ideal world. Multiple by 3. After some practice you can do it in a minute or two,    \nThere is more or TA indicators and strategies based on them. The whole think-or-squirm platform on TDAmeritrade is full of them.   \n\nAnd the final reminder. A news beats TA every time. Don't try TA earnings, use TA between earnings or on a grander scheme of several months to a year.  \n \ntl;dr TA is good for your emotional health.
