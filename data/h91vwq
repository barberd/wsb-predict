Everyone and their dog thinks the market will tank in July due to horrific earnings and the worst negative GDP growth for a quarter in 90 years.  The S&P will not dump in July.\n2. The SPX will dump in June (over the next 16 trading days) by 32% from the June 8 highs.\n3. However, starting July 9th, the SPX will start inexplicably improving (All while you are hearing the worst financial news possible, Covid spikes, death, more riots, bankruptcies exploding, anemic earnings, etc...). Sound familiar?\n4. After improving in July, The SPX will chop between 2200 and 2500 in August and Sept as those in power employ every last measure to limp the market past the election.\n5. Biden will win comfortably and piss his pants on national television while he's being sworn in...before Christmas, Kamala Harris will be our 47th POTUS with William Henry Biden being our brief 46th.\n6. By Groundhog Day 2021, the USA will look like Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome and the SPX will be at 1100.\n7. February 3, 2021...You may now go long and prosper.\n8.
