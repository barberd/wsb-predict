{"id": "d0d3cz", "title": "Before the Trade War: What caused market volatility in 2011 and 2015?", "selftext": "I was doing some DD into other reasons the market under-performed in recent years when there was no trade war. \n\nLike under Obama there wasn't a trade war with China, but something caused the market to suck in 2011 and 2015.  What was that?\n\n\n\nYear |  S&amp;P500 | w/dividends  \n:--|:--:|--:\n2018  | \u22126.24% |  \u22124.38%\n2017 \t| 19.42% |\t21.83%\n2016 \t|9.54% \t| 11.96%\n2015 \t| \u22120.73% | \t1.38%\n2014 \t| 11.39% \t| 13.69%\n2013 \t| 29.60% \t|  32.39%\n2012 \t|  13.41% \t| 16.00% \t\n2011 \t| 0.00% \t|  2.11%\n2010         | 12.78%  | 15.06%\n2009 \t|   23.45% \t|  26.46%\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n**TL;DR after extensive research into causes of stock market returns in good years and bad years...IMO there's evidence it does not matter much who is President nor what their policies are.**\n\n\nThe trade war is not the reason for recent market volatility. The market would not be tranquil and stable if there was no trade war. The market wants to dance its bipolar dance and will find a reason.\n\n**What appears to happen is people / investors / traders / the media will [ fill in the blank with whatever issue is in the headlines at the time ] and use that as their beacon, to over-react and under-react to, and to connect it to market activity.**\n\nLike moths spinning around a light at night, if you turn that light off the moths will just go find another light. If there was no trade war the market would still be doing its thing, going up and down, sometimes Bigly up and down, as it always does. But another issue in the headlines would be slotted in as \"causing\" volatility.\n\nWhen it's time for the trade war to be replaced as issue of the moment (because a trade deal actually happens or just when public gets bored of it and wants a fresh issue to worry about) here's some problems the market might want to pick to cause volatility in some future year. 2020 might be fully booked already, but I got you 2021:\n\n1) Baby boomers retiring \n\n2) Baby boomers not retiring \n\n3) climate change\n\n4) lack of climate change\n\n5) Inflation worries\n\n6) Deflation worries\n\n7) People in the market getting smarter\n\n8) People in the market getting dumber\n\n9) Immigration\n\n10) lack of immigration \n\n11) rapid creative destruction\n\n12) slow pace of innovation\n\n13) Health Care reform\n\n14) Algos\n\n15) Bots\n\n16) Aliens \n\n\n---\n\nFootnote: The market tends to get caught up in issues that aren't too obscure (has to be *USA Today* reading level understandable) and not something only finance people care about (no non-farm payroll, PMI or GDP prints. No one really cares. Not even 0.25 of 1% changes in interest rates by the Fed is going to get people riled up (25 basis point moves don't matter, dont @ me JP.
