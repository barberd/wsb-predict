Not only is Intel selling off like everyone else, they are in one of the hardest hit sectors and above all, their next gen processors are benchmarking at similar levels to AMD\u2019s current gen. This is due to intel still using 10nm technology that is inferior in every way compared to AMD 7nm. This gap in capacitor density is only going t wooden when AMD hits 5nm next year. Not only that, they are losing market share in every segment, commercial servers, custom, hedt, gaming, etc. AMD also has the silicon wafer advantage due to TSMC. Lastly, $EXPE puts expiring same time as the last, at 90. Nearing all tim lows in a all time correction. On top of that , the correction itself will specifically harm Expedia as travel will lessen.
