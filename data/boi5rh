However, to save trying to write back all the people who have messaged asking \"what is your next big biotech trade, I will just post it here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCalls on SLDB.  I'm going to wait until an hour or two after the market opens for Adam Feurestein or the likes to post their usual \"Solid bioscience fails again, this is the end of the world, Sarepta is god, blah blah\" article and see if the price goes down a little more.  But I'll probably go both June and July calls, and depending on the stock price and price for contracts either strikes at 7.5 or 10.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you want me to explain why the stock is going down and why I think it will go back up I can do that.  Or if you want me to prove that I did the exact same thing last Feb when a very similar thing happened I can do that too.  Or if you just want to make fun of me or comment on how I'm not as smart as I think, i'm an asshole, or how your great uncles sister worked at Pfizer and she could never make money on biotech, then go ahead.  I'm not saying it's a guarantee or that I'm never wrong, but I have been right more than I have been wrong in biotech.", "created_utc": 1557836170, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/boi5rh/my_big_biotech_trade_today/", "is_self": true}
