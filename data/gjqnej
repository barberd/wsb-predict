Somebody seems to have thrown around $100M on deep ITM puts and deep OTM calls with a June 12 exp, volume seems to be really low normally.\n\nThe bid/ask is wide so it's hard to tell in some cases, but they seem to be selling calls and buying puts, bearish overall.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia they provide technology and consulting to food, hospitality, and hospitals, which all seem to be taking a hit.\n\nHonestly the options are a little expensive and volume too low for my taste, just wanted to see what other people thought. Does seem to be a huge bet by someone.", "created_utc": 1589476748.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gjqnej/ecl_ecolab_options_activity/", "is_self": true}
