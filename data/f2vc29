However, the current CEO is the same guy that managed to turn Target and other sinking ships around to go on to be profitable. Even though they had a rough 4th quarter, they still had profitability in various departments, and their leadership is bullish, and long term investors trust them.\n\nSo how did the news affect the stock? It tanked it. What does that mean for us? It put us into a position where we can snap up calls for extremely good prices. I bought in this morning on $12 2/28 calls for .37 ea, and they are already trading at .67. The underlying stock is still extremely undervalued and trading just under $12. Analysts have valued the stock even after the latest earnings at $16. I'm extremely bullish on this stock rising at least a few $, and you should be too!\n\nTendies in just over an hour of buying in:\n\n[https://gyazo.com/acbeee1dac1bda77df2bcaa3d6859108](https://gyazo.com/acbeee1dac1bda77df2bcaa3d6859108)", "created_utc": 1581530941, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f2vc29/bbby_was_oversold_and_is_now_cheap/", "is_self": true}
