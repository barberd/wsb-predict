{"id": "hbinvp", "title": "Potential Acquisition Target: VVNT", "selftext": "Alright, so I have a new account and can finally post and some retards yelled at my for my first post ever on [$TDG](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hawit4/account_finally_old_enough_to_post_first_dd_of/) which was just a stock play, so here is a higher return play.\n\n**TL;DR** Buy Vivint Warrants or stock: Warrant ticker is VVNTWS stock is VVNT (can't buy warrants on Robinhood, sorry)\n\nOptions have basically no volume, and warrants have a 2025 expiration and require two to purchase one share of underlying stock. If you don't know what a warrant is then spend some time on youtube or investopedia for 5 minutes.\n\n**So who is Vivint?**\n\nVVNT was originally APEX, which was an alarm company. They rebranded as they expanded its business from alarm systems to begin offering home-automation equipment and services. They operate by doing door-to-door sales and they have been growing like crazy but never turning a profit, just continually expanding their subscription model. The door-to-door sales have been very effective for them. A typical college kid that sells for them will pull in $30,000-40,000 minimum during the full 4 months, and some dudes kill it and make hundred of thousands.\n\nA negative about this strategy is you're gonna be dealing with a lot of lawsuits as salesmen will say/not say anything to get the sale. Several lawsuits are about how people were misled that they were with their current alarm company like ADT. Basically they went in and said \"hey we are with the alarm company, we can lower your bill $20 a month and get you new equipment, just sign here\" and some customers assumed it was their current alarm company, not an entirely new one. I see this alot, last summer I saw a guy get out of a truck, put on a orange construction vest and hardhat, and then start knocking doors on my street last summer, acting like he was with the utility company. Any sales company will have these people who sell this way. Overall, not worried about this as much, its a cost of doing business in door-to-door sales.\n\n**OUTLOOK**\n\nVivint lowered its guidance like basically every company did with Covid. They have salesmen year-round, but most of their sales come with a huge influx of college kids who hit the doors in the summertime for them. So with Covid, they had to stop knocking for a bit and chill, but last I heard they are on track to hit their original number as the sales are doing well with people home because of shelter-in-place and working from home, and with the riots they have some areas nearby looted areas that are begging for new systems to be put in immediately. Also, the non-college salesmen are looking at spending an extra month out there to make up for the month they lost, so should be a wash. All the fat incentives they give their sales people are all pushed to September and October.\n\nAverage RMR (Subscription revenue) is around $78 this year, compared to $65 last year, so even if sales are stagnant, they win. They also unload all of their front-load costs onto consumers right now so they are doing much better than their peers.\n\nAlthough Vivint revenue hasn't dropped a ton like some other companies during this, Since 2009, Vivint has been losing money and has accumulated $2.5B in accumulative tax losses which have accumulated since 2009. Those losses are a nice asset, especially for a company that can come in and improve their operational costs. They are going to be coming up on their 1 year since IPO in like 6 months and there are a ton of shares owned by the employees which will come off of restriction and get sold, so I will probably sell sometime before that, if nothing else changes.\n\n**Perfect Acquisition Target?**\n\nVivint as a cash flow machine and with their big share of the security/home automatic market share, they look like a perfect target for an acquisition.\n\nSo, rumors were that they almost sold to a few companies. I guessed one before which was Comcast, but Comcast was actually out of the picture early. Would make sense for them strategically to get into the home automation business by acquiring Vivint's strong cash flows and customer base. But not sure why that fizzled out. The talks that got the most traction were Softbank, and Bosch. The number I heard floating around was $6-7B, but Bosch wanted full operational control, and they wanted full retail, but Peterson loves door-to-door since he's killed it that way for over 20 years. If that price was accurate, that is 2x what their market cap is now.\n\n**Insider buying**\n\nTodd Peterson, the founder and CEO recently started buying up a bunch of shares last month. I don't think billionaires do that just for a quick 30% return. They aren't tryna pay short-term capital gains.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/36o9371eap551.png?width=1618&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6b63caa6242d973075705bee7063c6d34b8996f\n\n**My positions**: 15,000 warrants and 2,000 shares\n\nI did all my DD when I saw Todd buying to get in, but I had to wait 30 days to post with my new account, so I already made 260% on my warrants while the mods kept me from posting about it. Sorry, but kinda not too. Still room for more to partake in the tendies.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I'M NOT YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISER AND DON'T KNOW YOUR RISK TOLERANCE.
