{"id": "decf5k", "title": "The 4 paths to become millionaire as an autist", "selftext": "So if you google paths to become millionaire, there are several articles with the same typical 4 paths, as an autist, most of them are really hard, but can we become millionaires with any of them? \n\n**1)** The Saver-Investors path\n\nBasically just start really young and do safe investments.\n\n*So, how to become millionaire as an autist with this path?* It's literally the only one doable for us, be young, live extremely frugally, get two shitty jobs that pay at least $70k per year but live with $30k or less, get an autist frugal wife and don't have kids. Invest like $40k a year in safe shit like bonds, ETFs, blue chip stock, occasionally sell puts if you want to \"buy on discount\" or sell out of the money calls, leverage your money to invest in \"safe\" real state, wait 45 years .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2)** The Dreamers Path  \n\nYou have to pursuit a dream in which more than 95% of the people fail miserably and lose everything but pays absurd amounts of money for little effort once you succeed (but requires a lot of effort to succeed). Examples of this path are becoming and actor, singer, football player, having a successful YouTube channel, doing successful start-up. For most of these, you don't have to be smart but you need to have talent PLUS you need to have an extroverted personality that \"everyone likes\", leadership, communication and networking skills, knowing the right people, etc. As an autist, you're the opposite of that and have a weird, quiet, introvert personality that no one likes and no leadership skills or any ability to interact and communicate. You could open a youtube channel but no one would really watch it.   \n\n*So, how to become millionaire as an autist with this path?* Don't waste your money in \"safe\" investments that are too slow and gey, just save the $40k until you see a stonk that is about to moon and follow your dream of YOLOing it all in FDs, hope for at least 2,500% return and you'll become millionaire overnight. You get a new try every year. \n\noption 2: be billy boi gates  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3)** The Company Climbers path \n\nYou have to become some executive or CEO of a large company and have a total compensation of like $500k/yr you've worked your entire life for this one company or corporate and are now at the top. As in path 2 you also need an extroverted personality that everyone likes, leadership, communication and networking skills, knowing the right powerful people, public relation and marketing skills, etc. You can do an average job but you want to have the kind of relationship with your boss so they want to invite you to do some drugs in a strip club.  \n\n*So, how to become millionaire as an autist with this path?* be born rich, be son of a successful medium-large business owner that will make you CEO when he wants to retire even if almost no one likes you.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4)** The Virtuosos path \n\nYou need to be naturally a genius plus formal education and dedicate your life to become an expert in a specific area. Someone among the best in the whole world, who is almost irreplaceable. For example, successful surgeon or lawyer. To be successful in the legal field, once again you need the same likeable extrovert personality as in path 2 or 3 and knowing the right powerful people.\n\n*So, how to become millionaire as an autist with this path?* Well you could be one of the best programmers/software developers in the world. Even then, if your first interview is not technical and you're screened by a recruiter that will ask typical shitty STAR questions, they will choose some other stupid guy that they liked more for the next round of interviews, I've seen this happen in google, microsoft, facebook, amazon, tesla. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n In conclusion, you just wasted your time reading a shitpost with no real useful information on how to become rich, now you can go all in in FDs.", "created_utc": 1570410557, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/decf5k/the_4_paths_to_become_millionaire_as_an_autist/", "is_self": true}
