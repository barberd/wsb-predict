A 3-5% death rate is only accurate for people who are presenting to the ER with pneumonia. Very sick people die more than less sick people. The case fatality rate (CFR) in South Korea, where hundreds of thousands of people have gotten tested, is more like 0.5%. The CFR on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was filled with old people and where \\*everyone\\* was tested, was 1%.\n\nThe bad: It doesn't matter. The economy is fucked.\n\n\\- Read this post on /r/medicine COVID megathread about the situation in Italy. [https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fgabx9/megathread\\_covid19sarscov2\\_march\\_10th\\_2020/fk3cphw?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fgabx9/megathread_covid19sarscov2_march_10th_2020/fk3cphw?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\n\nExcerpt:\n\n\"The current situation is difficult to imagine and numbers do not explain things at all. Our hospitals are overwhelmed by Covid-19, they are running 200% capacity. We\u2019ve stopped all routine, all ORs have been converted to ITUs and they are now diverting or not treating all other emergencies like trauma or strokes. There are hundreds of pts with severe resp failure and many of them do not have access to anything above a reservoir mask. Patients above 65 or younger with comorbidities are not even assessed by ITU, I am not saying not tubed, I\u2019m saying not assessed and no ITU staff attends when they arrest. Staff are working as much as they can but they are starting to get sick and are emotionally overwhelmed.\n\nMy friends call me in tears because they see people dying in front of them and they con only offer some oxygen...\"\n\nActually, go read that whole megathread. Those are smart doctors who are getting first-hand accounts about what is about to happen here.\n\nItaly is coming to the US. In South Korea, people wear masks regularly, worry about being sick, and are generally the best possible patients. In China, they put police outside of apartment buildings to enforce quarantine until the worst of the virus passed. Neither of those things is going to happen in the US.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Here is the map of COVID infections. Look at the US. There are cases popping up everywhere, and there are no travel restrictions. There is no containing this now.\n\n[https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)\n\n\\- Major universities have stopped holding in-person classes. Academic conferences have been cancelled. So has SXSW in Austin, for that matter. Even the most head-in-the-sand Trumper must realize that these things come with enormous financial costs, and aren't actions that are taken lightly.\n\n\\- There are going to be actual economic repercussions because of supply-chain disruptions. There are entire industries that are going to be crippled for years because no one wants to go on the Royal Caribbean Petri Dish of Infection and Death cruise or ride the \"Lifelong Pulmonary Fibrosis\" ride at Six Flags. This has probably been priced into the market.\n\n\\- The US populace is going to \\*freak the fuck out\\* when they see news coverage of people dying in the hospital halls because there aren't any ventilators. This has not been priced in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL/DR - You're relatively unlikely to die from coronavirus. It's still going to tank the market when the optics of Italy start getting shown on Fox News.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositions:\n\nLong SDOW, RXD, FINZ. 6/19 put on BTI at 35. Long RHHBY, since it makes the one publicly traded pulmonary fibrosis drug. Long Alibaba, since China is mostly better now. Other puts incoming, but I haven't decided which ones.", "created_utc": 1583857896.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fggk0w/what_you_need_to_know_about_coronavirus_to_make/", "is_self": true}
