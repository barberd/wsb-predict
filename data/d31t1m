They\u2019ve gained a lot of new government contracts this quarter, not to mention they\u2019ve been consistently beating earnings estimate for awhile now (albeit not by much). Even if they don\u2019t beat by much I feel like guidance will be great with everything they have in the pipeline. At the very least, this thing is gonna run up a lot the next week ahead of earnings IMO", "created_utc": 1568257667, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d31t1m/how_do_yall_feel_about_a_blackberry_bb_earnings/", "is_self": true}
