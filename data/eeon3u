{"id": "eeon3u", "title": "DD: Invest in Norway ($NORW)", "selftext": "Alright boys, time for some shitty DD. Its christmas and I know you're all trying to avoid social interaction with our kinsmen, so enjoy:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNorway was like the only country to escape the 2008 meltdown unscathed. Reasons why? Probably because it\u2019s a super wealth country and it\u2019s democratic socialist model (government owns minority shares in most industries, and is uninvolved in corporate operations) gives it a lot of stability in times of trouble. With everyone in the U.S. (me included) worried about a stock market contraction, where can you park money? Cash gang faces a slow burning fire of upticking inflation, gold is gay, and bonds aren\u2019t sexy at all. Like who buys bonds, my grandpa cashing her social security check for pain medicine? Gtfo. \u201cEmerging markets\u201d = corrupt markets, and everyone knows China is a ticking time bomb economically, plus Trump is gonna get reelected and return to raw dogging big daddy Xi, which may lead to war. Also, there is no way I\u2019m putting money in shitholes like Mexico, India, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNorway is extremely stable. It isn\u2019t in debt. It doesn\u2019t\u2019 have an insanely reckless financial system. Its people are attractive. The socialist model brings with it the benefits of capitalism (it is a capitalist country) with a strong welfare state. Global warming will open up the North Sea Route in the late 2020s, which is the quickest trade route between China / Japan and Europe. Russia owns most of this route but Norway owns the end of it\u2026and this will require a massive amount of infrastructure development. Moreover, global warming will make Norway more agriculturally productive, and open up mineral resources in the Arctic\u2026but bullshit aside, Norway is dope af. Sexy fucking people, strong environmental and social laws, beautiful environment, engaged population and sound governance, and its not in the EU (so its not gay). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMany of the things that make me worried about the future (global warming, chaotic international system, massive corporate / government debt, etc) are NOT factors in Norway. The country literally just does shit right. Since we all know TA is bullshit anyway, go with what you know: Norway is probably a good custodian of your money in times of trouble, and bro, trouble is on its way. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust sunk 20k in $NORW. Its an ETF with a .5% fee but it\u2019s an index with broad exposure. Gonna hold for the next two years as a safety for my US holdings (400k in cash, indexes, ADBE, etc) then cash out if (1) the U.S. stock market drops bigly. If it doesn't, I'll probably sell into 2021-2022 as environmental change begins to get priced in, and north sea route infrastructure starts being constructed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\------\n\n\\*\\*TL/DR: Constant anxiety about a recession in the U.S., oversold stock market, makes US indexes / stocks risky. Bonds suck, though, and gold sucks too. Inflation is ticking up, so going #cashgang is a slow BBQ to your tendies. Norway is a solid place to park money. The country is extremely stable, wealthy af, and performed really well through the 2008 crisis.  Global warming will benefit it in the near term (20-years or so). Norway\u2019s democratic socialist model makes it more resilient to crashes (government owns minority stakes in most major enterprises)\\*\\*", "created_utc": 1577126682, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eeon3u/dd_invest_in_norway_norw/", "is_self": true}
