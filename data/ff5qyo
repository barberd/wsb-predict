Granted, this could be nothing, but the guy mentioned that the companies that produce the alcohol used in their products are starting to have mass shortages and so will start upping the price of alcohol in the next week to ten days. \n\nWhen one starts to think about how many goods use alcohol as a base, one has to assume this has a knock on effect across the board. Not sure how it will impact overall market, but certainly gives credence to supply chain issues and how that will wreck havoc and push product price inflation beyond where it is out now.", "created_utc": 1583633516.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ff5qyo/anecdotal_dd_hand_sanitizer_supply_chain_issues/", "is_self": true}
