Slow but deeper drawdowns coming", "selftext": "**TLDR:**\n\n**-Market is pricing 1.58 Months of Shutdown**\n\n**-We cannot stay at these Covid19 active case growth rates for more than 2 months before a vaccine is developed. Since a vaccine will unlikely be developed in the next 4 months, shutdown must be longer and more restrictive.**\n\n**-S&P 500 Pre-Crisis CAPE Ratio of 33, Currently 25.5 without dropping earnings. Long Term Average 17.03. Extremely overvalued.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor markets, it\u2019s not so much about the absolute number of infections or deaths in the first order, but how long policies will be in place that disrupt earnings. Currently, 1.58 months of disrupted earnings are priced in. From a preservation of human lives standpoint, this is not enough and a longer shutdown with possibly more restrictive orders will be required.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How is it implied that 1.58 months of shutdown is expected?**\n\nAs of Feb 21. SP&500 P/E Ratio was about 25, currently it is 19, assuming no change in what the market deems it should pay for earnings is, this implies a 24% drop in earnings.\n\nWhat is the effect on monthly earnings of the shutdown? Blended profit margin for S&P 500 is 11%, variable costs that can at best save 80% of costs. Assuming only 10% of revenue generated, if shutdown last a year, that\u2019s a loss of $107 vs an earnings of $132 from 2019.\n\nThis loss per month is about $9. How many months of $9 dollar losses and a miraculous jump back to $11 a month of earnings to reach our implied 24% drop in earnings?\n\n(-9\\*m + (12-m)\\*11)/132 -1 = -24%\n\n76% \\*132 = (-9m-11m+12\\*11)\n\n100.32 = -20m + 132\n\n\\-31.68 = - 20m\n\nM = 1.58\n\n*Market is pricing 1.58 months of shutdown.*\n\n**Is this feasible?**\n\nLet\u2019s assume a vaccine can get widespread adoption in 200 hundred days, a miracle in of itself, even in this scenario, only 1.58 months of shutdown would be devastating.\n\nNew covid-19 cases are currently occurring at a rate of about 23% of the previous days active cases. At this rate, the current inconvenience felt doesn\u2019t make a dent in the spread of covid-19. In 2 months, we\u2019d almost be at 200 million infected. Even assuming that the previously infected cannot get re-infected, a majority of the US population gets infected before any vaccine can even have an effect.\n\nIf we get to South Korea\u2019s rate of 2% through even more extreme practices in lockdown, then things look good where we can actually reduce the total active infected. However, as soon as we stop that 1.58 months of trying and go back to our 23%, we\u2019ll shoot back up to 200 million infected in 3 months. (It took as longer this time because we were starting from a lower number).\n\nIn short, there cannot be more than 2 \u2013 3 months where we have an active infection growth rate of 23% before we get the vaccine.\n\nAs gung-ho as the President is to get the economy working again, I don\u2019t know if other parties would allow him to given consequences.\n\nThis was a very rough estimate with many gross assumptions, but it seems that as things seem to be, there is no reasonable way things can get back to how they were without significantly more sacrifice. The market has underpriced the negative effects of the shutdown. Even in the event of a recovery, valuations relative to earnings were already substantially high relative to long run averages and it is unlikely that they would return to such levels of exuberance in inflation adjusted terms.\n\nWhile all this is bearish, the time horizon is unclear. Impact on earnings might only most noticeably be seen in Q2 which will be reported much later in the year.\n\n**The Trade:**\n\nStraight puts are ill-advised with IV as high as it is. Bear Put spreads could be preferable in picking expiries further out past July. (In hindsight in writing this, I too realised that mine were expiring too soon)\n\nWhile it may feel late, long positions could be sold and tax-losses harvested. Alternatively, covered calls could be sold on your existing longs.\n\nIn addition, I've personally sold ES=F short.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/U3lTzM0](https://imgur.com/a/U3lTzM0)", "created_utc": 1585518756.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fre3w6/24_drop_in_earnings_158_months_of_shutdown_priced/", "is_self": true}
