{"id": "ftk5ts", "title": "Stimulus Package and SBA Loans on Unemployment/Hiring Numbers", "selftext": "Ok Autists, the applications for these open on Friday and from what I have heard it is expected for these loans to be granted within one to two weeks to everyone that qualifies. Which is pretty much fucking everyone.\n\nThen next week they are allowing sole proprietors to apply for them as well. This will dramatically cut the number of unemployment applications and all the companies that are being granted these loans will be hiring back the entirety of their workforce. It's either that or they have to pay back large chunks of these loans.\n\nI would expect unemployment to continue to surge in the next two weeks, followed by the numbers majorly dropping during the end of the month going into May. Once the stimulus money clears and everyone and their half sister are approved for these loans people will be getting hired back. I would expect the April hiring numbers that will be released in the beginning of May to be fucking massive.\n\nI'm assuming this is going to cause a major surge at the end of April or beginning of May absolutely fucking Put holders that held too long.  \n\nMultiple CPA's I have spoken to have all said \"This is free money, you are an idiot for not taking it\" everyone is going to fucking take it.\n\nSource: small business owner that will be applying for one of these SBA loans.\n\nEdit: With this it could be possible that the bottom could be in sometime around the end of April.  These loans are giving businesses 2 months worth of operating costs.  That would give a pillow until mid June hopefully have the Rona sorted out. If we don't shit will get ugly again.\n\nPositions: 5/1 SPY 225P, 4/17 UPRO 25P", "created_utc": 1585824074.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ftk5ts/stimulus_package_and_sba_loans_on/", "is_self": true}
