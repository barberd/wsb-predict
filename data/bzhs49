The dollar gain is no where near brag worthy but at least the percentage gain is a decent start right? Kinda sad I didnt sell much later in the day when it went down even more. Coulda made 133% FML. \n\nAnyways thanks for reading my shitpost. This has been a much needed a confidence boost heading into my cfa exam.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/nKCSLJW \n\nThe last screenshot is showing how much of an idiot I\u2019m for selling early.", "created_utc": 1560285179, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bzhs49/bynd_first_option_trade_ever/", "is_self": true}
