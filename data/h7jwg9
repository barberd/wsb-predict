I live with my parents, This is my friends account. I turned 1k into around 10k in a week, and then after Jerome spoke on Wednesday, I anticipating the market is gonna crash. I bought VXX calls Thursday and it turned to 60k but somehow SPY is up today (dead-cat bounce).\n\nI suggested to have an All Bears Day.. This is not a pump and dump but it's Friday, and this bounce is fake. Markets across the world are BLOODY RED. CNBC blames RH and WSB for the market rally.\n\nIf we can make the market rally to pre-coronavirus highs, we can make it crash. I'm not pumping or dumping this market. It's gonna dump with or without us. We all see it!\n\nAll Bears Day is our protest!! It's our day to say we own the market not some JPOW printer going BRRR.. We need to save our money not invest it like fools when the market is tanking. Keep your money out the market. Pull your IRA or 401k (Market's not gonna recover for 2 years atleast). Don't invest in anything... except maybe puts against your overvalued no-name companies, or go for the VIX's (TVIX, UVXY, SPXS, VXX).\n\nSave yourself today and spread the word. We don't trade in false economies. We let them die.\n\nUPDATE!! \ud83d\ude01 https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h7luyv/all_bears_day_update/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\n\n[All Markets Everywhere](https://preview.redd.it/m1c35i4x4h451.png?width=2440&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ff00201ee04f46216576f6fb770ce28346ce267)", "created_utc": 1591965365.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h7jwg9/all_bears_day_june_12th_2020_lets_make_it_happen/", "is_self": true}
