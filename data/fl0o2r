I\u2019ve lurked here for around 5 years now and did a lot of research before finally downloading RH and putting my first $50 in. After 5 days I\u2019m already up 500% with a lot more room (3/27 Uber 15p got in at .90). Ive done a lot of dd on both lyft and Uber and knew these plays were good. I\u2019m not an expert but I\u2019m also autistic enough to be able to do research more thorough than others.\n    \n    \nHOLY FUCK. This is the most excited I\u2019ve EVER been in my life. Why didn\u2019t I go into this sooner? I thought I needed to become an expert before I started but nope, my normal amount of artism is more than enough for me to belong. I haven\u2019t jacked off in a fucking week it\u2019s like the gains replace the cooms. I can\u2019t focus on work I\u2019m just completely obsessed. \n     \n     \nCan you get paid to be a retard? Are there actually guys who play options (granted maybe in a setting with less personal risk tolerance) like we retards do? I feel like this is my calling. It\u2019s the only thing that I can relate to with my wife\u2019s boyfriend nowadays and it\u2019s really rekindling our relationship. I can\u2019t even imagine how well he would treat her if he found out I was a professional autist trader.", "created_utc": 1584578413.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fl0o2r/can_you_get_paid_to_be_autistic/", "is_self": true}
