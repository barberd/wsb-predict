{"id": "ga06vp", "title": "Why Forescout is the best short on the market", "selftext": "**Position: 12/18 $25p**\n\nForescout Technologies **(FSCT)**  is the BIGGEST short nobody is talking about. Forescout is in the process of being acquired Advent International for a huge overvaluation of $1.9 billion.\n\nFORESCOUT ISN'T WORTH HALF OF THAT. The company is under fire with a class action lawsuit for price manipulation.\n\n[https://www.rosenlegal.com/cases-1751.html](https://www.rosenlegal.com/cases-1751.html)\n\nWith the most recent failed buyout of Embraer by Boeing its obvious liquidity issues will plague M&A for quite some time.\n\n[https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/25/business/boeing-embraer-termination/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/25/business/boeing-embraer-termination/index.html)\n\nIn addition to all of this OFFICERS AT FORESCOUT ARE DUMPING SHARES!\n\n[https://imgur.com/f7rqMCj](https://imgur.com/f7rqMCj)\n\nIn my entire investing career I have never once seen officers at a company dumping shares headed into a merger. Especially because the price of the buyout is $33/share and they're willing to lowball themselves at $32 or less to get out. THESE OFFICERS ARE PARACHUTING OUT! I think it's incredibly clear the officers are using the news of the merger to dump shares before hearing that it wont go through. PRICE TARGET $10.\n\n**Position: 12/18 $25p - I WOULD RECOMMEND BUYING OTHER PUTS - because you autists think im trying to sell you my position.** \n\n[https://imgur.com/M9CbcKm](https://imgur.com/M9CbcKm)", "created_utc": 1588123723.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ga06vp/why_forescout_is_the_best_short_on_the_market/", "is_self": true}
