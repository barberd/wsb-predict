I noticed in the hallway a paper that advertised jobs waiting the elderly.\n\nMy time at brookdale was short and sweet. They had a variety of rooms for the elderly ranging from multi person dorms to penthouses going for an easy 3,000 to 4,500 per month. The entire floor staff would rotate by the time I quit.\nIt was a fairly disgusting place as middle management would often pinch pennies in the wrong places and tell us to re use glasses that had not been washed, give napkins that had not been cleaned.\n\nBoomers dropped their parents off like clockwork and would rarely visit. It was the most disheartening experience I\u2019ve ever had working somewhere and made me think long and hard about what I want to have happen to my parent when they reach that age.\n\nBoomers are going to be a huge market in the next two decades arriving to these places,\n\nLong BKD.", "created_utc": 1565567759, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cp4gdl/why_long_bkd/", "is_self": true}
