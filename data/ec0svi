Public ARk Publishing for Users  \nMonday, September 30, 2019 2:10 PM  \nORO VALLEY, AZ / ACCESSWIRE / September 30, 2019 / Tautachrome, Inc. (OTC PINK:TTCM) today announced 1.) mass deployment of 3.5 million public business ARks inside the ARknet augmented reality platform, and 2.) public ARk publishing for users.  \n\n\nMass Deployment of 3.5 Million Public Business ARks  \n\n\nDevelopment is underway for the deployment of 3.5 million publicly accessible business ARks across the United States. Preparation testing for business listing deployment was completed as part of the recent ARk Hunt 2019 event.  \n\n\nTautachrome's focus with business listings is to create a viable alternative for local search that takes on the monopoly held by Google. Millions of business geo listings will be preloaded into ARknet and will be searchable by users' in-ARk personal radar system. Business ARks will show users information about retail businesses that are directly around them, setting the stage for interactive AR landscape visualizations. Businesses that claim their listing will be able to activate additional features and capabilities for a nominal fee.  \n\n\nThis is a significant ARknet advancement, bringing us another step closer to our goal of gaining market share in local search and retail business services. We will deploy the public business ARks in major markets throughout the United States starting in October and continuing through the fourth quarter of 2019.\u00ad  \n\n\nPublic ARks for ARknet Users  \n\n\nTautachrome is excited to announce that later this week public ARks will be available for ARknet users. Currently, by default, all content created within ARknet is private or marked as restricted content viewable only by friends. Public ARks will allow users' access to public postings worldwide. This will create a rich and dynamic environment for social media content that users can engage with and share.  \n\n\n$$TTCM , ARknet \"3D OBJECT IMPLEMENTATION TEASER!\"  \n$$TTCM , ARknet 3D abject implementation teaser !

(OTC PINK:TTCM):  \n\n\nViro Media Integration  \n\n\nEarlier this year Tautachrome, Inc selected Viro Media, Inc as a unified Augmented Reality layer to integrate with Apple's ARKit, and Google's ARCore. This allowed our development team to accelerate and simplify the initial development of AR objects and interactions. On October 16th, 2019 Viro Media announced, \"To ensure the Viro platform continues to capture these developments, we've decided to turn it over to the community and open source the platform in its entirety.\" Further stating, \"We've gone with the MIT license to enable unrestricted use.\"  \n\n\nThe primary implication of Viro Media going open source is the rapid acceleration of Augmented Reality development becoming available for integration into ARknet. Per Viro Media's announcement, there are over 20,000 developers already integrating Viro Media AR components.  \n\n\nSegment-on-AMCs-Nationally-Broadcasted-NewsWatch-TV-Show!  \n[https://www.accesswire.com/568120/Tautachrome...ew-Episode](https://www.accesswire.com/568120/Tautachrome...ew-Episode)  \n\n\nDownload ARknet for Android  \n\n\n[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id...ive.arknet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id...ive.arknet)  \n\n\nDownload ARknet for iOS  \n\n\n[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/arknet/id1466870072](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/arknet/id1466870072)  \n\n\n[https://twitter.com/Tautachrome\\_Inc/status/11...9831378945](https://twitter.com/Tautachrome_Inc/status/11...9831378945)  \n\n\nPreparations are now underway for submitting ARknet 1.0 to the App Store &amp; Google Play for a broader beta release.

(OTC: TTCM) today announced a company update including public launch of the ARknet 1.0 Social Media Utility Platform application, revenue generation milestone achievement, and a second reduction in the authorized share count.  \n\n\nPrivacy-First Social Platform ARknet V1.0 Publicly Launched  \n\n\nTautachrome is excited to announce the public release of ARknet 1.0. Individuals currently enrolled in the IOS and Android testing programs are the first to receive this release with submission to the app stores for approval to follow. Upon app store approval we anticipate ARknet 1.0 to be available for download in The United States, Canada, and Australia. This version will allow for user adoption to begin on the network and will give users the ability to add credits to their account which can be used to create private and privately shared geolocated augmented reality objects. Qualified users will be able to publish content publicly.  \n\n\nOur technology partner Honeycomb Digital is governing engineering, and deployment of the Platform\u2019s capabilities. Leveraging the Honeycomb Archive enterprise platform allows for rapid development of new versions and features. Versions 1.1 and 1.2 are slated for release in the upcoming months.  \n\n\nA growing ARknet community has come to life around the ARknet platform and its broad application for business and personal use. With a passionate community and the ability to allow everyday users to juggle complex data objects, ARknet is poised to be an essential Internet communication tool with privacy and security at its core.  \n\n\nOn 8/25/19 we will attempt to set a Guinness Book world record for the largest scavenger hunt using the new ARknet platform. Over 750 Augmented Reality Arks will be hidden across all 50 states with clues to each hidden Ark. These hidden ARks can only be collected by visiting the physical locations. Teams must be no less than 4 people, but no more than 10 people so choose your team mates wisely. Please visit www.ARkhunt.io for more information. Join us and be a part of setting a new world record!  \n\n\nRevenue Generation Milestone Achievement  \n\n\nThe company is also pleased to report that with this release we are now generating revenue within the ARknet platform via credit card purchases. Creating a sustainable revenue model has been one of our goals for some time. Revenue from ongoing activities within the app will allow us to continue to improve the features and functionality of the app as well as provide a solid path for growing the company and increasing shareholder value.  \n\n\nFive Hundred Million Reduction in the Authorized Share Count  \n\n\nIn March the company increased its authorized shares from 4 billion to 6 billion in order to accommodate reserve requirements that we were obligated to fulfill. Last month we announced the reduction in authorized shares from 6 billion to 5 billion. Tautachrome is pleased to announce that a further reduction of 500 million authorized shares is in process. This will be noted by the Secretary of State of Delaware and by our transfer agent in due time. This second reduction in shares authorized brings our share count down to 4.5 billion. We would like to again state that we have no plans or intentions of conducting a reverse split of Tautachrome stock now or in the future.  \n\n\nAdditional Tautachrome Statement  \n\n\nWe are truly grateful for the patience and support of Tautachrome shareholders!
