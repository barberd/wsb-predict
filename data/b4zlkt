NOTE: Pre-Owned, though a small component of the total revenue mix, contribute a large percentage of operating income.\n\nEBITDA \u201820E: ~$325 mm\nCapex \u201820E: ~$100 mm\n\nRedemption of 2019 notes frees up ~$45 mm in Levered Free Cash Flow\n\nCash position: ~$700 mm\n\nMy investment thesis isn\u2019t based on a turnaround, but instead on pre-owned sales declines normalizing around the mid, single digits, with potential upside catalysts from continued strength in digital and accessories sales (these categories had comp. sales in the low double digits). Base case forecasts also assume flat software/hardware sales.\n\nIn summary, you have a company with a cash position of $700 mm that is projected to generate ~$325 million in EBITDA in 2020, with zero debt in its capital structure; cash horde can effectively buy back a significant portion of the float, especially so if the dividend is cut to support larger scale buybacks.\n\nCatalysts: \nTender Offer: would prefer this to open market share repurchases as it would effectively force management to put an explicit time period on buybacks\n\nShare Repurchases: immediately value accretive\n\nTarget Price: $18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "created_utc": 1553451906, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b4zlkt/gamestop_investment_thesis/", "is_self": true}
