{"id": "gun1mo", "title": "My next June earning play during this pandemic, UNFI Food", "selftext": "## What is UNFI Food?\n\nUnited Natural Foods (UNFI) is a food wholesaler. They are currently best known as the [supplier to WholeFoods](https://www.refrigeratedtransporter.com/foodservice/grocery/article/21712244/unfi-extends-distribution-agreement-with-whole-foods) and is one of the largest food distributors in America.\n\n## How the coronavirus plays in\n\nGrocery spending is higher, [up 27% from this same point last year](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/13/shoppers-shift-from-stockpiling-to-penny-pinching-at-the-grocery-store.html). Online groceries have skyrocketted as well, projected to [increase by 40%](https://www.supermarketnews.com/online-retail/online-grocery-sales-grow-40-2020) in 2020. The growth in online grocery sales is obviously the result of COVID with 52% of consumers polled stating that 2020 was the first time they had purchased groceries online; note the massive spike in [APRN](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/APRN). Let's also not forget about lower fuel costs and higher food inflation, which increased [2.6% in one month, or 4.1% for 12 months so far](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm), for \"food at home\" category. This obviously benefits UNFI further. In addition to this, UNFI will benefit from the [CARES act](https://www.waste360.com/food-waste/keeping-food-table-pandemic) via increased deductibility of interest expenses, potential for tax loss carrybacks to prior years (at a higher, 35% tax rate) and faster depreciation of improvements. The exact amount is hard to estimate, but it will be just icing on the cake. The cake is described below.\n\n## Earnings\n\nEarnings is [June 10th](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/unfi). What's interesting is that this company were so excited to release their earnings, they put out a [preliminary report](https://ir.unfi.com/news/press-release-details/2020/United-Natural-Foods-Announces-Preliminary-Third-Quarter-Results-and-Provides-COVID-19-Business-Update/default.aspx) and they absolutely hit it right outta the park. Adjusted earnings per share was up 130% from 61 cents during the same time last year. Revenue for the quarter comes in 12% higher than the $5.96 billion reported in the fiscal third quarter of 2019. They also reported a net income of 88 million a 57% increase from the same period last year. **The company pulled their 2020 guidance since they said they already hit it and they\u2019ll update it when earnings come out.** These guys did their ENTIRE year of projected earnings in ONE QUARTER. They used this to pay off massive amounts of debt and even sold off some stuff that they can use to pay debt down further. As a result of this preliminary report, the stock price popped to $22ish and has now dropped a little since. When the updated earnings report comes in, I expect the stock to really pop. But since it won't be for another 13 days, we can play off the earnings run-up as well as more investors buy in with anticipation. A lot of people are going to say the news is already priced in due to the preliminary being released, but it really isn't. Updated guidance for 2020 should be announced at earnings and this will be the catalyst for movement. Last reported short percentage is 18% of float, so this could put a hurt on the shorts when guidance comes out. \n\n## Previous Highs\n\nThe [stock traded at high 40s](https://i.imgur.com/aH4Spts.png) back in 2018 and has been getting shit on since down in the teens. But right now, everything about this stock shows it\u2019s going to continue upward and the full earnings report will be the catalyst. In 2018, the company [bought SuperValu](https://ir.unfi.com/unfi-acquires-supervalu/default.aspx) to expand into conventional grocery, increase scale, realize synergies and, likely, diversify away from reliance on Whole Foods. A large part of this massive drop from high 40s was due to investors thinking this decision was trash. For a while it seemed that SuperValu acquisition was an expensive mistake as there were delays, extra expenses and customer service issues. Well jokes on them because it ended up working out and now it\u2019s paying off in spades. This acquisition gave the company a leg-up from other competitors who are struggling from coivd19-related supply chain issues, as UNFI can easily reach all of their retail partners quickly with 58 locations.\n\n## Cash Flows\n\nSkip this part if you're not super into the technical details. While the expected GAAP ([generally accepted accounting principles](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/GAAP-generally-accepted-accounting-principles) earnings per share and net income are already impressive, it is actual free cash flow that matters most. It is especially true for UNFI, since they need to reduce debt and move from around 5x leverage to the target they have of under 3x. The free cash flow, or FCF, is significantly greater than net income for the following reasons.\n\nThe company made a 338g tax election, which allows it to depreciate acquired SUPERVALU assets accounting them at a high tax base, resulting in high depreciation non-cash charges, much greater than ongoing CapEx. Depreciation appears to be running $30 million less than CapEx per quarter, or $120 million annualized.\n\nAt $30 million per quarter or $120 million  a year, the difference between D&A and CapEx contributes another $2.24 per share in free cash flow. The end result is $426 million in annual adjusted FCF or $7.96 per share. Assuming the cash flow goes to debt reduction, the annual interest expense gets reduced by $25 million a year, improving net profit by $20 million and increasing EPS by $0.37.

If I change my mind, I'll be putting edits at the bottom of this post like I did with my previous DD's. This stock was given a price target of [$22, raised from $10](https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+PT+Change/United+Natural+Foods+%28UNFI%29+PT+Raised+to+%2422+at+BMO+Capital/16889479.html) by BMO Capital analyst Kelly Bania about 2 weeks ago, but I think it'll go higher. There are some analysts that claim it can go back to last year's valuation of $40 per share long term, so holding shares of this stock wouldn't hurt either.\n\nAlso shoutout to /u/theodros1 who posted DD on this a week ago but only got like 16 upvotes. \n\ntl;dr I'm buying $22.5c 6/19", "created_utc": 1591026786.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gun1mo/my_next_june_earning_play_during_this_pandemic/", "is_self": true}
