I play options off the industries I know and if I get a good or bad feeling. Then I look at the historical averages to see what\u2019s feasible and I play my options further out (3-6-9 months). I go by the wsb theory of, \u201cif it\u2019s good enough to screenshot, it\u2019s good enough to sell.\u201d If I see an option go up 40%+, I sell, or I\u2019ll sell enough to cover the initial purchase and let some ride (this is honestly the hardest part but just hit the sell button\u2026if you start thinking, \u201cwell, what if\u2026\u201d then you\u2019re in trouble). Most of the options I\u2019ve sold for a profit go up even more, but I try not to look. For example, I bought 3 $160 calls (exp 3/20) on Disney for $248 a few weeks ago, today I sold one option at 300% and another at 500%. I\u2019ll let the last one ride.\n\nDisclaimer: I do have 15 shares of Tesla with an average cost of $235 and 1 (free) share of CHK (up 5% to $0.70 today baby).
