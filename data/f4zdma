{"id": "f4zdma", "title": "Need Help with Biotech", "selftext": "Okay Biotech gods, me (and I'm sure a bunch of other autists) around here want to know how to better profit off of FDA approvals, drug phases, etc. on n these Biotech/Bio-pharmaceutical companies.\n\nI bought calls for AIMT and AGRX in hoping their drugs would be FDA-approved and they were. The problem here is that their stock prices didn't spike as much as we all hoped. Now granted the FDA announced the drug approvals on a Friday afternoon so figure not many traders/institutions would be buying when the weekend's about to start. But still...\n\nStocks only go up, and I'm losing money. Like What The Fuck.\n\nShould I just be buying ITM Calls from now on? Is that really the main strategy?
