They are a good proxy for whats happening in Cushing. From their website - \n\n\n>Enable Midstream (NYSE:ENBL) is a publicly traded master limited partnership formed in May 2013 that owns, operates and develops strategically located natural gas and crude oil infrastructure assets serving major producing basins and markets.\n\n\nHere's my little story: one of my acquaintances (don't have any friends) is part of a major pipeline contracting outlet (100+ men who work for no less than $35/hr), and they just got signed onto a multi-month contract doing **construction** and repair for ENBL. \n\n\nConstruction being the key word. ENBL is building more storage and infrastructure to increase their survivability if something crazy happens like we saw a few weeks ago with negative prices and such.\n\n\nAs long as contractors like my acquaintance are getting big jobs like this, I don't see it as anything other than a reason to go long with these guys for the next 6 months or so.\n\n**ENBL 5c 7/17** is a safe bet\n\n**ENBL 5c 6/19** if youre feeling stupid\n\nThis is free money people, and you bet your ass they will be a $6 before the end of the year.", "created_utc": 1589985778.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gnckti/global_energy_crisis_just_buy_enbl_calls/", "is_self": true}
