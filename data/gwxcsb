{"id": "gwxcsb", "title": "GAN - online casino software provider and sports betting (now has call options)", "selftext": "Thoughts on \"GAN\", recent IPO, and recently has call options as well! Provides SaaS to all casinos. Casinos are smart and I see them preparing to go fully online in case of 2nd wave. It would be silly for them not to be prepared. GAN provides the backend for these casinos to go online and also provides them with all the support needed to run an online gambling website. Lastly, gan has a patent that they have already successfully defended. The patent allows them to bring casino loyalty programs to the online platform.\n\nWith sports coming back especially basketball news today I see the stock flying. Even if sports do not come back I see them helping struggling land casinos to form a growing interest in online betting.", "created_utc": 1591329734.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gwxcsb/gan_online_casino_software_provider_and_sports/", "is_self": true}
