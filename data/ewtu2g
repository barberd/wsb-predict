Obviously I know that is an extreme but it did pump me up and has me working extra hard on TA and research and seeking information in order to feel confident in taking a shot on a bigger one. \n\nI know some of you bastards probably know the dirty or just sit around all day researching and doing TA and know of a good play (maybe that you are making yourself or are wishing you had the ability to be able to) that is going to move big on earnings. That I may not think to consider or even have the ability to really even know to consider... Or possibly even one that I may be thinking about but just don't have enough info to give me enough confidence to pull the trigger on a bigger move. \n\nAnyways, let me know, anyone who gives me legit info I need in order to feel confident enough to make the move and of course profit on it, is getting a cut of the profit via BTC, XRP, whatever. Either just post on this thread if you want or probably better yet if it's really good info shoot me a DM and we can discuss more or through another messaging app or email.", "created_utc": 1580500205, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ewtu2g/give_me_the_best_yolo_option_play_it_hits_partna/", "is_self": true}
