{"id": "bkt74j", "title": "My picks 5/6-5/10", "selftext": "Previous week's picks:\n\n* MA Just as planned, even better actually. Entering and exiting positions is a strategy and a valuable one. Take. Your. Profits. So what if you missed out on a 30% gain when you already took your 175% gain when the next day it fell. That was MA's case on Tuesday, if you stayed in your would've made nothing, even lost more the next day. It ran up 8 dollars after earnings.\n\n* SHOP ran up far exceeding my expectations. Not gonna lie I was a little bearish the couple days after SHOP expecting people to sell off today when I was dead wrong. If you stayed in you'd be up hundreds of dollars, even on FD's.\n\n* AMT; I was wrong on this, they did beat earnings however their stock saw no major jumps after or before ER.\n\n-----------------------------------\nThis week's picks;\n\n* OXY: Occidental Petroleum corp is looking at buying anadarko petroleum with talks going well. I think next week OXY is going to see a big play and its gonna jump the stock 7-9% over the week.\n\n* I'm also bullish on Anadarko Petroleum, I think they're going to get good news and they will jump about 10% as well.\n\n* ETSY I am also bullish on. Never go against BECKY\n\n* I'm bullish on JD, after Amazon pulling out of China I think JD has good earning potential and good growth out look which will jump the stock.\n\n* I\u2019m expecting TTD to beat their earnings as well. They will probably jump 10-14 dollars up.\n\n* Disney I\u2019m a little bearish on. I\u2019m gonna avoid this however if I was going to play I\u2019d go in on some puts. They\u2019re heavily over bought and if they miss by the slightest its gonna drop significantly.", "created_utc": 1557026031, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bkt74j/my_picks_56510/", "is_self": true}
