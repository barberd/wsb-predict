{"id": "bmytc4", "title": "Congressional activity: week of 5/13 to 5/17", "selftext": "Good Friday, and welcome to the first installment in what I hope will be a weekly series on Congress and financial markets. The general idea is that the statements and actions of federal legislators can have an effect on broader markets. I try to provide interesting happenings as well as participants. I don't suggest any specific stocks or positions: I'd like those to come from consensus in the discussion. Thus, this is flagged as Discussion rather than DD.\n\nA few things to keep in mind:\n\n- All of this is subject to change at any time (i.e. votes can be delayed, hearings can be canceled, witnesses can be struck). The House and Senate operate under their own rules, and those rules are entirely enforced by the chambers themselves.\n- The House is controlled by Democrats, and the Senate is controlled by Republicans. So if a hearing is happening in the House, it is somewhat safe to assume that it reflect a relatively liberal position. However, the committees have representation by both parties, so the discussion won't be entirely one-sided.\n- In general, recorded votes on the ``floor'' of either chamber are taken the most seriously, followed by votes (or hearings) taken by the full committee, followed by votes (or hearings) by a sub-committee.\n- The Senate is generally taken more seriously than the House, since it moves slower and is less likely to produce legislation. Thus, the legislation it does produce is exceptionally important. A corollary, though, is that the Senate has much less activity in any given week (only 100 members, but the same workload [plus appointments] as the 435-member House).\n- The floor schedule of either chamber is notoriously hard to predict more than a day or two in advance, as it is structured almost entirely by party leadership and can change on the whims of that leadership. Hearings, however, are relatively more stable and scheduled. (In other words, the hearings are much more certain to happen, while the votes can be added or subtracted with much less certainty.)\n- This is not all activity, just activity most likely to be relevant to financial markets. There is also no guarantee this activity has an effect on any individual stock or market. I'm not an expert, and this is not advice. It is the beginning of a discussion.\n\n***\n\nShared activity (across both chambers):\n\nRetirement security. The Senate will hold full committee hearings on 5/14 (https://www.finance.senate.gov/hearings/challenges-in-the-retirement-system), and the House will hold full committee hearings on 5/15 (https://budget.house.gov/legislation/hearings/keeping-our-promise-america-s-seniors-retirement-security-21st-century).\n\nThese are paired with hearings on financial regulators. The House will hold full committee hearings on 5/16 (https://financialservices.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=403653), witnesses TBD. The Senate will hold full committee hearings on 5/15 (https://www.banking.senate.gov/hearings/oversight-of-financial-regulators), with a guest list that includes The Honorable Randal K. Quarles, Vice Chair for Supervision, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; The Honorable Jelena McWilliams, Chairman, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; and The Honorable Rodney E. Hood, Chairman, National Credit Union Administration (https://www.regreport.info/2019/04/26/bank-credit-union-regulators-testify-may-15-before-senate-banking/). \n\nAdditionally, the House will hold subcommittee hearings on 5/16 on CFPB regulations of payday lenders (https://docs.house.gov/Committee/Calendar/ByEvent.aspx?EventID=109487). This set of hearings will almost certainly mention consumer-unfriendly practices like predatory rates, and it might also bring more attention to the 15% cap on interest rates recently proposed by Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez (https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/05/09/bernie-sanders-ocasio-cortez-want-cap-credit-card-interest-rates-percent/?noredirect=on). \n\nAll in all, it does not look like a good political week for XLF.\n\n***\n\nHouse activity:\n\nThe House will blast drug companies &lt;again&gt; this week. The House will hold full committee hearings on 5/16 on the profits generated by drug companies using federal money for research and development (https://docs.house.gov/Committee/Calendar/ByEvent.aspx?EventID=109486), specifically inspired by the case of Truvada, used to treat HIV, a drug made by Gilead Sciences (GILD) (https://www.chron.com/business/article/Company-profits-from-HIV-drug-funded-by-taxpayers-13718793.php). GILD yesterday (5/9) announced that it would be donating HIV medication for 200,000 people per year (https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gilead-to-donate-hiv-medication-for-up-to-200000-americans-a-year-2019-05-09), assuming they're trying to get out in front of this hearing.\n\nThis is coupled with the only pair of bills so far on the calendar for a floor vote in the House: one on lowering prescription drug prices (https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20190513/BILLS-116HR987-RCP116-14.pdf) and another to undo friendly waivers to states designed to undermine the ACA (https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CRPT-116hrpt44/pdf/CRPT-116hrpt44-pt1.pdf).\n\nThe House will hold subcommittee hearings on 5/15 to --kill Boeing-- get the status of the Boeing 737 MAX (https://transportation.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/aviation-subcommittee-hearing-status-of-the-boeing-737-max). Witness list includes the FAA Acting Administrator and the Chair of the NTSB, which investigates air accidents. They might provide an updated timeline on getting the MAX back in the air, but that might be derailed by consumer-friendly Democrats looking to score points on Boeing.\n\nThe House will hold subcommittee hearings on 5/15 on oversight of the FCC (https://energycommerce.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hearing-on-accountability-and-oversight-of-the-federal-communications). All five commissioners of the FCC are expected to attend (https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF16/20190515/109479/HHRG-116-IF16-20190515-SD001.pdf), which would include Ajit Pai. I'd expect net neutrality to be a big talking point, given the argument, which could leave ISPs vulnerable if the subcommittee pressures the FCC to take a more active stance (https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/05/ajit-pai-refuses-to-investigate-frontiers-horrible-telecom-service/).\n\nLastly, the House will hold full committee hearings on 5/15 on advancing renewable technologies (https://science.house.gov/hearings/advancing-the-next-generation-of-solar-and-wind-energy-technologies). Might be worth a random flyer on any small solar or wind company if they talk about subsidies, etc.\n\n***\n\nSenate activity:\n\nThe Senate will hold a hearing 5G technology on 5/14 (https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/5g-national-security-concerns-intellectual-property-issues-and-the-impact-on-competition-and-innovation). With Lindsay Graham at the chair, it could just be an opportunity for bashing China, given his love for Trump and the recent tariff events (https://www.multichannel.com/news/senate-schedules-5g-hearing). But the FCC auction of spectrum space and rhetoric about the importance of 5G security could play well to infrastructure and technology players (like XLNX) or tower leasers (like CCI). \n\nThe Senate will hold full committee hearings on 5/16 on carbon capture and energy exploration in the states (https://www.energy.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/hearings-and-business-meetings?ID=FD4452FC-9B4E-483B-9A65-10D7CF1BA919). This one is interesting: the legislation is ostensibly about carbon capture to offset the effects of climate change, as reflected by the environmental concerns of Lisa Murkowski, co-sponsor of the legislation and Chairperson of the Committee and Natural Resources. But the text of S. 1201 reads as a pilot program to try and offset fossil fuels with carbon capture (https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/s1201/BILLS-116s1201is.pdf), which would help stabilize long-term energy interests. The witness list includes a SVP of OXY and a SVP of NRG. There is a bunch of money made available for pilot programs, a lot of which might eventually go to those same energy companies.", "created_utc": 1557497712, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bmytc4/congressional_activity_week_of_513_to_517/", "is_self": true}
