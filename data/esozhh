{"id": "esozhh", "title": "NIO to Add 200 Storefronts in 2020", "selftext": "Looks like NIO is adding 200 stores to showcase their products and entice the Chinese public in 2020. \n\nHaven't heard much buzz around here the past few days, except about the rumors of if they secured their funding or not. This makes me think they did for sure.\n\nNIO currently has 22 NIO House and 62 NIO Space. That's a huge addition if they are committed to it. \n\nThe news was announced originally by Wei Jian, the vice president of operations to Tencent's online news platform Yixian.\n\nhttps://m.benzinga.com/article/15162665", "created_utc": 1579759338, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/esozhh/nio_to_add_200_storefronts_in_2020/", "is_self": true}
