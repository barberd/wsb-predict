Well, thats what I thought one day when I bought an AMZN call thinking \"easy, I sell for $50 profit and run. I'll do that over and over and all will be well.\" Well within 3 minutes, my 1900C on AMZN went from $23.15 down to $11.57. An $1,100 loss...IN 30 MINUTES. I punched things, I screamed.\n\nFast forward through to today, I adopted the theta gang strategy after that brutal loss and sold bull put spreads on AAPL and SPY and collected that sweet, sweet premium. Iran almost did me in but thank the heavens above Mr. Trump did not declare WWIII when I was holding put spreads over night during that fiasco. After today, I will only be down $15 all-time and I'm retiring from options.", "created_utc": 1579276400, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eq2523/it_was_almost_fun_but_im_done/", "is_self": true}
