{"id": "bhhll4", "title": "Venting Frustration", "selftext": "You guys probably won't care, but I want to let out some frustration:\nSo recently I became very invested in the Semiconductor Insustry, and particularly Micron. They were such an undervalued company, with a P/E ratio in the single digits and their PEG ratio less than one. Furthermore, their Q4 earnings in 2018 stated that they were seeing a rebound in memory prices in 2019. That gave me the green light to buy (yes I know you guys mostly do options). Their Q1 earnings was disappointing, however their stock didn't drop like we all expected it to. I got my hopes up when they were seeing a rebound in memory prices in the second half of 2019, a similar theme in their previous earnings. I became invested in Semis around this time all together because of my prior knowledge with PC hardware (built my PC). I was rooting for companies like AMD, Intel, and Nvidia. After Texas Instruments reported earnings recently however, they warned that we were only 2 out of 5 quaters in a historical downturn before Semis could bounce bank. Intel realized these fears by also reporting shitty estimates for the future. I was gonna turn to AMD, since they have their 3rd gen CPUs releasing this year, and are gaining an edge against Intel with their smaller chip sizes. I guess I always had it in the back of my head that it would take longer for a rebound to take place, but decided to ignore it and get my hopes up with MU and AMD. AMD's stock had gained so much momentum in the past couple of months, so it sucks so much to hear the industry you love is taking a downturn. I thought things were going to take an upturn in 2019, now its sounding like 2020. I may try to move away from Semis for a little, but it's really tough to hear that the industry you've been following fail when you think things are going the right way.", "created_utc": 1556248660, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bhhll4/venting_frustration/", "is_self": true}
