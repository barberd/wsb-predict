{"id": "dn1a57", "title": "VZ Growth", "selftext": "What\u2019s the deal with VZ? It\u2019s beat earning consensus the last 4 quarters. It keeps posting better revenue. This past quarter, it doubled wireless customers compared to the previous quarter. It\u2019s growing every one of its businesses, the only arm to lose customers was its Fios Video, whatever the hell that is. It even pays a decent dividend.\n\nIt\u2019s up only 7.8% compared to S&amp;P 20%. It\u2019s showing growth across the board. It could lead the charge in 5G just as well as anyone else at this point. It launched 5G in 13 new cities this past quarter. \n\nI know it\u2019s trading near ATH, but why isn\u2019t this thing pushing higher? What am I missing?", "created_utc": 1572026813, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dn1a57/vz_growth/", "is_self": true}
