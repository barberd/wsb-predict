There\u2019s also speculation around how the 4/15 \u2014> 7/15 tax deadline extension will play out for the company. In short, these earnings will be lower, but forecast for next quarter will be higher. \n\nI\u2019m holding $300c 5/22 in hopes that the stock trades flat to up ahead of earnings (of course), but I\u2019m also expecting IV to spike Thursday. \n\nLet me know what you think.", "created_utc": 1589923598.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gmxogq/intuit_dd/", "is_self": true}
