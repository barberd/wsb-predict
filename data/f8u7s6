{"id": "f8u7s6", "title": "The selling from systematic", "selftext": "MS QDS estimates $5 to $10bn in equity needs to be sold today / $20bn over the rest of the week from systematic and price reactive traders today. \n\nThis number would be a lot higher except dealers are long $3 to $4bn of SPX gamma per 1% move here which cuts today\u2019s number in half (i.e. option rebalancing is about $9bn to buy, offsetting other drivers of supply). The pace of the selloff (i.e. volatility) is the key driver of how much needs to be sold \u2013 CTA triggers are far away for US futures so most of the supply comes from deleveraging on the back of higher volatility (for CTAs and Vol Target funds). \n\nFor every extra 50 bps selloff here QDS models roughly $20bn in more supply this week, and a close below ~3235 (-3%) on the SPX threatens to bring in enough supply ($60bn+ total) this week to generate a self-fulfilling downward move.", "created_utc": 1582563651, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8u7s6/the_selling_from_systematic/", "is_self": true}
