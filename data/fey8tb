What's interesting about the dynamic is that it typically hovers at a pretty consistent range of 25-30. Analytics show that it's currently oversold. \n\nRRGB has been offered (allegedly) a buyout at a price of $40 a share. I'm thinking if the market keeps tanking (which all of you gay \ud83d\udc3b 's have been praying for the recession since last year) maybe the buyout happens.\n\nIf the market comes back, I definitely see this stock being bought up at a low price.\n\nTldr; My play is modest, calls are cheap, Calls: $30 4/17", "created_utc": 1583601948, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fey8tb/lets_talk_about_rrgb/", "is_self": true}
