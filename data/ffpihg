{"id": "ffpihg", "title": "Selling RCL Puts", "selftext": "Listen up fellow autists. Long time lurker and first time posting. I need you guys to point out why I'm retarded for even thinking up this idea. \n\nSo I noticed that Jan 2021 $40 puts on RCL are about $700 each. If I put up the $4000 to sell a put, I either get assigned and own the 100 shares or make $700. If I got assigned, couldn't I just turn around and sell a call on my shares? I know the prices will have changed by then, but Jan 2022 $70 calls are currently going for around $1900. Between the premium on selling the put & call (assuming I got assigned) I would hopefully have lowered the amount of money I put into the trade by a significant amount and by 2022 I either keep the premium from the call & my shares or be forced to sell at $70 each which would still net me a capital gain of $3000 plus my premium collected from the contracts.\n\nWorst case RCL goes to $0 and I lose $4000 minus premium collected and we're all dead from beer virus by then. Probably not the YOLO play you all are looking for, but please tell me where my autism is showing.", "created_utc": 1583729633.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffpihg/selling_rcl_puts/", "is_self": true}
