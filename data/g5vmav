That was late 2008, which happened to be the sprinkles on the shit sundae that because our economy going into the recession.  I know he was just a drop in the bucket compared to the MBS fiasco that tanked wall street's best and brightest, but he was still pretty destructive and added fuel to the fire of panic in the market.  The billion dollar question this go round is who will be outed as a ponzi scheme/scandal going into this next recession?  I'm hoping HLF finally goes to zero, as they are the biggest POS ponzi scheme MLM out there, but I lost big betting against them during this last rally.  Maybe we already had our moment with LK coffee, but I'm guessing the best is yet to come.", "created_utc": 1587534612.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5vmav/whats_going_to_be_the_2020_madoff_moment/", "is_self": true}
