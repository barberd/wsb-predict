Or to make me seem less like a dick allocate capital to helping Australians rebuild. Also is this being overblown or is this really a massive issue in Australia and where can we find our long positions and short positions.\n\n\nIf an Aussie can list some firms in these fields that would be great.\n\n1: construction: either companies engaged in construction, suppliers (does Home Depot operate in Australia).\n\n2: possible political backlash to CO2 emitters, possible public investment/ tax credits focused at renewables / carbon neutral.
