Was happily investing in index funds/boring shit like apple until I somehow came across this retarded subreddit. I immediately lost 40k on china stocks weeklys, instantly destroying 60% of my account and realizing those losses for 2018. Took a break and held just stocks and actually gained quite a bit back because the god damn sp500 itself popped like 20% over the next two months. Managed to time perfectly the next two drops in may and july, buying calls on software stocks right as everything started dropping again. After 3-4 more heartattacks this year, I finally broke even thanks to tesla/nvda STOCKS as well as software company options (coup,ttd,okta,etc.). I'm still holding PLNT and SPOT calls into next week.   \n\n\nThings I learned:   \n\n\nJust wanted to say thanks for this experience guys. I do have to admit having a 6 figure job helped my recovery as well (although I'd say my annual return for this year is like 60-70%, with consistent deposits every month while eating ramen). Thats why I didn't need to call the hotline. Going to try to look at 2020 the same way I approached 2019 and maybe if I'm still alive by then I'll post another update.", "created_utc": 1572138437, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dnmnf1/my_journey_after_discovering_wsb_1_year_ago_thank/", "is_self": true}
