And I have a bullish theory. I\u2019m not financial \u201cadvisor\u201d whatever the hell that is. So do your own research even tho you won\u2019t and you will just buy calls because of confirmation bias.\n\nAnyway so JNJ basically paid a nothing fine, for them it\u2019s like buying a cup of coffee. They are down mostly because of their dividend payment but also because of a generally worry in the stocks future. But this company is as strong as the wall of daddy trump. And it shouldn\u2019t falter as they make more money than anyone can count. Judging by their forward PE and their general book value looking great I believe that the market actually OVER sold the stock and I expect a stock price of about 130-132 by earnings. After that I would guess a fair value for this company to be between $133-136. This company is a powerhouse and the market oversold it. They could feed asbestos to children and I\u2019d still buy under $130. Let me know your thought and send me your thots also.
