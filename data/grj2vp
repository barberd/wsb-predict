{"id": "grj2vp", "title": "Estee Lauder (EL): Collateral Damage from Neiman Marcus Bankruptcy", "selftext": "On May 1st, Estee Lauder ($EL) released their Q1 earnings. The earnings were abysmal: A net loss of $6 million when they had a net profit of $555 million the same quarter last year. A decrease of only 11% in revenue caused that swing due to their incredibly high operational cost of doing business mostly out of brick and mortar stores in high rent districts.\n\nThey attribute this loss directly to store closures due to Covid-19. Yet, the majority of those stores didn\u2019t close until March so they had 2 months of normal business in Q1. The stores that carry their brands have now been closed twice as long in Q2 as they were in Q1. The bear rally is completely predicated on everything going back to pre-February levels of consumerism and employment. What we\u2019re headed for is persistent unemployment and timid consumerism. The office buildings of NYC, LA, Chicago, SF are not going to be packed with fashionable people wearing their new brands and meticulously done makeup any time soon. The people being pushed to back into the workplace are factory workers, supply chain, food production, and similarly important functions of the economy whose employees don\u2019t typically dab on $250 Le Mer eye cream or $150 an ounce foundation. The people who buy Estee Lauder are working from home wearing stretch pants and putting on a mask to go to Whole Food (i.e. no makeup). Q2 is coming into its last month and EL is going to report incredibly steep losses. The stock is at $186, they started January at $195. In May of 2019 they are $165. Commercial rent is not like residential: they typically sign up for multi-year leases. This is especially true for huge chains. They're on the hook for the rent at Saks 5th avenue and all of their other locations; hence an 11% decline in revenue dropped them into negative earnings.\n\nThere is no bailout coming. Neiman Marcus, one of EL\u2019s main retailers, didn\u2019t get a bailout either and they\u2019re in bankruptcy. With so many people having problems paying their basic bills, no one is going to tolerate government assistance going to luxury brands.\n\n[https://media.elcompanies.com/files/e/estee-lauder-companies/universal/investors/earnings-and-financials/quarterly-earnings/2020/q3/q3-fiscal-2020-earnings-release.pdf](https://media.elcompanies.com/files/e/estee-lauder-companies/universal/investors/earnings-and-financials/quarterly-earnings/2020/q3/q3-fiscal-2020-earnings-release.pdf)", "created_utc": 1590583631.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/grj2vp/estee_lauder_el_collateral_damage_from_neiman/", "is_self": true}
