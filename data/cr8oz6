{"id": "cr8oz6", "title": "NVDA and ATVI have something in common, and here's how you can profit (DD)", "selftext": "TL;DR: buy ATVI and NVDA. Hold for next 30 days or so. Sell after 5 to 10% increase in share price. \n\n---\n\nNVDA and ATVI are twin stocks. The similarities are stunning. \n\n* NVDA and ATVI are down 46.2% and 44.5% from their all-time highs\n\n* Their all-time highs were reached on October 1st, 2018\n\nRefer to the [ATVI chart](https://imgur.com/a/uXREdDN) and the [NVDA](https://imgur.com/a/fIIv5LN) for this analysis. \n\n* Both stocks have 50-day moving averages that are right below their 200-day averages. I mean *right below.* Both 50-days look like they are about to blast through the 200-day. When this happens, you often see the price find support on this 50-day as it rises. \n\n* ATVI's 50-day is literally 2 cents below the 200-day. NVDA's 50-day is about $2 below the 200-day\n\n* NVDA's RSI is 48.07 and ATVI's RSI is 48.70\n\n**Bottom line: Both these stocks have taken big hits over the last 9 months. They are big cap stocks that are down by almost 50% each. Both have 50-day averages that look poised to break above their 200-days. When this happens, I predict both stocks will find support on that 50-day, and ride up.**\n\nTarget exit price: \n\n* 5% to 10% up from present levels within next 30 days. You choose how risky you want to be\n\nRisks: \n\n* Trade war. A Trump tweet putting on another 25% tariff will destroy NVDA. But things seem ok on this front--Trump doesn't want to fuck the economy during the holiday season. Tariffs will be a problem in December, but by then, you will have already made money. \n\nFundamentals: \n\n* NVDA just had a great earnings. The first great earnings since falling from it's former glory of almost $300 per share. AI is the future, but that doesn't really matter for this short term trade. All you need to know is sentiment is good, and should be good *for the next three months.*\n\n* ATVI: I don't know enough about the company. I just know gaming is a cash-cow because of Millennials and gen-Z who are playing games all day.", "created_utc": 1565972583, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cr8oz6/nvda_and_atvi_have_something_in_common_and_heres/", "is_self": true}
