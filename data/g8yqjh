However, when we shelter in place we lose the the chance to do this, thus after months our immune systems are weaker,**\n\nCOVID survives on surfaces of plastics for 3 days. We still go out and buy stuff, we bring COVID into our homes anyway, yet workers can't go to their jobs\n\ninitial lockdown was correct as we didn't know how deadly this is, but the data that's been coming in for These last months shows COVID to be less deadly .1% death rate compared to seasonal flu .13% death rate, data they got from CDC\n\nthey (the doctors) didnt wear masks in the clinic during SARS or Swine Flu\n\nso maybe its all up from here idk", "created_utc": 1587985640.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g8yqjh/possible_huge_second_wave_of_sickness_due_to/", "is_self": true}
