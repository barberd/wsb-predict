{"id": "f7ahos", "title": "WSB needs your help!", "selftext": "Hello WSB,\n\nI am a professional Stockiatrist with over 25 years of study in this prestigious but highly misunderstood field, and I have published over 100 world renowned, peer-reviewed papers in this field.  I say this not to brag, but in order to establish some credibility for myself and to the issue I outline below, for it is of the utmost importance. \n\nI have been studying this subreddit for quite some time and have discovered a rare anomaly. After reading through numerous posts and comments, and based on my extensive background in this field of study and my knowledge on the subject, I have estimated that at *least* 100% (possibly more) of this sub suffers from Misguided Autistic Retard Syndrome (MARS). Apologies for the professional jargon, but I must warn you that there are many more terms below that are common in my industry, but perhaps are not well known here. I will do my best to explain them coherently. \n\nThere is still so much we don\u2019t know about MARS, and after seeing all of the suffering here, it inspired me to create a movement. I brought the issue to some of my colleagues and managed to strike up passion over the issue in some, but only one individual took the issue as seriously as I. That person and I went on to co-found the organization known as the Fellow Autists Group (FAG). This person\u2019s efforts in understanding MARS come second to none, which makes me proud to call him, Elon Musk, my FAG partner. \n\nThrough generous donations, FAG has been the primary sponsor to our MARS research efforts. Our numbers have swelled so much that a single group was not enough. There are now several FAGs out there willing to help with MARS. \n\nWe have made great progress; however, we have recently run into an issue with our funding stream. r/Wallstreetbets (where the vast majority of our FAGs hail from) has seen a sharp rise in Posts of Unrealistic, Short-term Stock Investment Earnings Screenshots (PUSSIES). These PUSSIES have convinced many of the members of our donor FAGs to become a Holder of Out of the Money Options (HOMO), in the hopes of massive gains on unsubstantiated earnings bets. Unfortunately, this more often than not leads to a full loss of their investment. \n\nBecause of the sub\u2019s rise in PUSSIES, our FAGs are becoming HOMOs and losing their hard earned money. Without their support, MARS can not continue being properly studied and understood, and it is becoming a grave threat to all Autistic Retards, and therefore, everyone. \n\nElon and I are determined to better understand MARS, but we must now ask for your help. We need Every Autistic Retard That can Help (EARTH) to aid us in our understanding of MARS, or else EARTH may be doomed to suffer the same as MARS. \n\nI spoke with Elon on this at great length, and saving EARTH by solving MARS has become his life\u2019s work. Together, we formulated a solution that we believe may help. Given that the source of the funding issues are related to this sub\u2019s recent rise in PUSSIES, if we can help educate our FAGs and EARTH and stop them from becoming HOMOs, they will be able to donate more to help with MARS. \n\nTo put it simply: In order to continue the MARS research and save us all, Elon needs the FAGs to help stop the PUSSIES before they convince EARTH into becoming more HOMO. \n\nThank you for your time, and we beg that you please take this matter with the seriousness it deserves. This is Elon\u2019s ultimate vision and life\u2019s work, and he endeavors tireless everyday to ensure its success. Please help him to save us all. #FAGsForMARS\n\n\n\n\nP.S. I tried posting this 2 days ago and also yesterday before the big mod announcement but it was auto removed or something.", "created_utc": 1582288572, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7ahos/wsb_needs_your_help/", "is_self": true}
