{"id": "blywm7", "title": "I pick downright retarded options so you don't have to *mid-week Trade War edition*", "selftext": "My initial post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bjkmmk/i\\_pick\\_downright\\_retarded\\_options\\_so\\_you\\_dont/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bjkmmk/i_pick_downright_retarded_options_so_you_dont/) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have to say, I was feeling pretty autistic headed into the week of 5/6. I had loaded up on 5/08 300 lotto calls at 0.01 per contract, 35 of them to be exact, truly a large amount of risk for my broke ass to be taking on. GE calls were printing tendies, and EA calls were churning up some sweet IV. My AMD position was sitting at a lofty 28.2, well up from my cost basis of 26.8, and mostly (thank god) I was cash. Needless to say, I'm a complete fucking retard. Before I get into my spur of the moment, reactionary, completely retarded and impulsive update to last week's post, let's recap just how poorly my retarded picks have done so far: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEA(bullish): So, not gonna lie, this is all thanks to u/SoRefreshing, I'm way too retarded to identify a good play like this. Currently looks like it will open above 100, up about 8%. Think August/September 110-115s will profit quite nicely tomorrow if this holds. Good thing I bought 5/10 120 calls instead, gonna be feeling pretty fucking retarded come 9:30am. Regardless, probably will see some profit taking but looks good coming out of earnings. I expect upward momentum to continue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWYNN(bullish): Wow. I actually still think this will be a good play because I must be fucked in the head. If you bought calls already you're probably hating yourself, but I did say these picks were retarded. Currently, WYNN is down 11 points from the time I posted. Trade war sensitive? Maybe less Chineses will visit Wynn resorts or something. Who the fuck knows, just buy calls right before earnings if you really want to feel like a brick.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nROKU (bearish): Let me just start by saying fuck ROKU. This stock has done a whole lot of fucking nothing since the last post, which probably indicates that buyers are lining up to fuck me straight in the ass. Anticipating some sort of runup to earnings, I've of course held off from buying puts til right before ER. Now I can buy them at peak IV- all according to plan (I am screaming internally). If you weren't as retarded as me and bought your puts already, then godspeed, retard. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGE (Bullish as fuck): So, for starters, if you picked up some 10.5-11 calls around when I posted then you had a great window for a not retarded trade or two. Twice, the stock went to the low 10s and then back up to hit a high of 10.50. Good shit, GE. Not gonna lie, I just like this play all around still, mainly because I'm dense. They've proven pretty resilient so far for a trade war sensitive stock, and even though they've given up a lot of their earnings gains, I think it's still a great play. Thinking of playing 2-3 month, .5-1 point otm calls all the way to next ER, because I'm actually a mongoloid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow did the wildcards perform? \n\nUsing a scale of 1-10, with 1 being not retarded, and 10 being drooling idiocy:\n\n \n\nAMD 5/17 35c: 10\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSQ 5/3 90c: 10\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNVDA 5/17 230c: 10\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nATVI 5/31 70c: 10 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you played any of these, tally up your point total and grade yourself using a scale from 10-40, with 10 being objectively, scientifically retarded and 40 being so unfathomably retarded that any sane person would go mad trying to comprehend it, like some Lovecraftian eldritch retardation of some sort. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMoving right along, let's get into my spur of the moment, revised Trade War survival kit. It will come in handy, if you believe the only way to survive is to lose money. \n\n Would put a disclaimer here about not being a registered anything or person you should follow or trust in any capacity, but that much is painfully fucking obvious. I may not play all or any of these, and you almost certainly shouldn't play any of them, but here are the shitty plays I'm unfortunately thinking of making right now for some short term, degenerate, get rich quick fuckery: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nACB (bullish): Aurora Cannabis, baby. I stay high 24/7. This allows me to burn tons of cash, while staying functionally retarded- not unlike this company. Weed is trade war proof son, get with the fucking times. Beverages go online in Canada sometime this fall which should lift the sector and I like this stock anywhere under 9. Looking to buy some stock and catch an earnings run up, but honestly the whole sector could go downwards into ER (most report next week). If there is a run-down into ER, I'll definitely be picking up calls before they report. Could be early on this, but I had to get high to distract myself from this trade war and honestly I'm kind of retarded.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPINS (bullish): Fuck yeah, bitch. When the trade bombs are falling all around you and trade refugees are seeking shelter up your ass, your best friend's guts are in your lap after he took a trade bullet straight to the portfolio,  you know who sure as fuck won't be affected? White women, ages 18-35. Like my other pick, this one showed great retard strength through the first two days of the legendary trade war recession of May 2019. I expect the bleeding to slow down and eventually stop rather fast on this one, the fundamentals are too lit and grils are their main revenue source, buy calls on further dips and buy stock if it really drops- which I doubt it will because I'm somewhat special. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYANG (bullish): Being bullish on this one is like being bearish on China, or something. I'm not sure, this whole stock market thing is confusing. The way I see it, we are unlikely to reach a trade agreement on Friday. There will be more carnage ahead. If we DO reach an agreement on Friday, the terms of the agreement are almost certainly going to make China's dick look mucho small. I think the odds China is green these next few months is slim to none. You can buy YANG, calls on YANG, puts on YINN, or puts on CQQQ. Pick your poison, oh retarded assassin of Chinese meme stocks. Go forth, and lose money because of your lack of understanding of all things economic and geopolitical. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWild cards:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSPY 5/15 300c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJD 5/10 23p\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMU 5/17 33p\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRUN 5/17 21c", "created_utc": 1557277379, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/blywm7/i_pick_downright_retarded_options_so_you_dont/", "is_self": true}
