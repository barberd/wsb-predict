This isn't a market anymore and corrections are a healthy part of the economy.  Not letting it drop by 30% is madness and will naturally result in an overreaction of sell orders once BRRR stops which also risks that printing can never stop without a super depression.", "created_utc": 1586885274.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g19u96/are_we_supposed_to_get_call_options_now_so_100/", "is_self": true}
