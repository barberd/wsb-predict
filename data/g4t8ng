{"id": "g4t8ng", "title": "Betting on the Mouse", "selftext": "Hey all you cool cats and kittens, if you're like me, you've been a Mouse Hunter since Santa gave the world Bat Flu for Christmas.\n\nLike most struggling \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc31\ud83d\udc3b\ud83d\udc37, I've been rolling my puts further out, while learning how to better time the market using crayons and a Magic 8-Ball. Since there may only be a week or two more upside, it's possibly now the dumbest time to switch to calls, so of course I'm gonna give it a try.\n\nLooking at earnings this week, and trying to understand how the quants have been tuning their algos to hurt so good, I've come to speculate on DIS, particularly in its response to what may be very positive NFLX earnings after market on Tuesday, and the subsequent additional interest it may generate for streaming platforms as safe havens during the pandemic bear market.\n\n**Shower Thoughts**\n\n1. \"Buy the rumor\": \u2705 NFLX has mooned to ATHs, as the beloved streaming giant is a gg-ez stay-at-home play.\n2. \"Sell the news\": \u2611\ufe0f NFLX earnings may beat expectations on Tuesday, but it could go up or down, having already mooned by up to 78% since it's September lows.\n3. \"Buy the rumor\": \u2611\ufe0f If NFLX DOES beat expectations, or at least has a very positive Q1 and forward-looking statement, it could reinforce the \"rumor\" that ALL streaming services are going to the moon. Enter the Mouse, DIS, who owns HULU, Disney+, and a treasure trove of potential streaming IPs, like Star Wars, Marvel, FOX, and duh - Disney. If the algos are tuned to give any love to DIS on this news, let alone the Boomers, we could see it take off this week. \ud83d\ude80\n\n**In the News**\n\nIf you've been fighting the Mouse since late March, you're plenty familiar with how resilient this rascally rodent has been to bad news. Despite all the losses in parks revenue, it's bounced 30%+ since March lows, as Boomers have rallied behind their cheerleader big Don, and look to the Mouse to weather the storm in the hearts and minds of their kids and grandkids' kids. To that end, DIS picked up a new [$5B credit agreement](https://www.forbes.com./sites/jeffewing/2020/04/14/disney-seeking-to-weather-economic-storm-with-new-5-billion-credit-agreement/#581d49db7a3d) from Citibank last week.\n\nDisney+ already has over [50M paid subscribers](https://www.nytimes.com./2020/04/08/business/disney-plus-50-million-subscribers.html) in just 5 months, compared to Netflix's 167M built up over the past 13 years.\n\nWe saw last Thursday with GILD, how news on a single company can have [wide-reaching impact on the market](https://www.barrons.com./articles/the-dow-gilead-stock-coronavirus-covid-19-51587125308?mod=md_home_pan_mkt_news). LYV was up 22% AH on FAKE news of a cure and I about lost my mind staring at my puts being murdered. It seems plausible that positive REAL news about the impact of coronavirus on the leading streaming service could raise the tide for all of them.\n\nBonus [bullish news](https://thehill.com./policy/finance/493578-disney-to-stop-paying-100k-employees-as-cost-saving-measure-report) broke this weekend that cosmic brain DIS is saving $500M a month by not paying 100,000 employees. Ebenezer bull-gang confirmed.\n\nDIS is down today following the market's oil slide and a UBS downgrade, so calls are on sale. If I'm wrong about this, the worst case for me is all of my puts print; I just don't want to risk another week playing only one side.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* DIS 110c 4/24\n* SPY 205p 10/16\n\nSir, this is a Gamblers Anonymous.\n*This is not financial advice, just some thoughts on the market and speculations on what might happen this week.*\n\nGood luck, godspeed, and happy hunting!", "created_utc": 1587391041.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4t8ng/betting_on_the_mouse/", "is_self": true}
