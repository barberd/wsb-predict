Can someone post an image of the 9/19/2018 1-minute tick chart of TLRY when it hit $300. The historical stock tables indicate the Day's Low was $151 and High was $300 but it opened at $234 and closed that day at $214. Is that low of $151 accurate?!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ypvhr5njvy531.jpg", "created_utc": 1561234960, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c3ubaq/tlry_intraday_price_mvmt_on_9192018_when_it_hit/", "is_self": true}
