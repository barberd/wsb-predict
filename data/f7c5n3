Look no further than AMC.\n\nAMC has been beaten down for the last 5 years and is now trading well below their highs. But despite this, they've increased revenue and gross profits every single year. With other movie theater chains reporting higher earnings it's expected AMC will do the same.\n\nWhy you should care about some dumb movie stock\n\n\n- Earnings announcement on 2/27. All the other movie theaters are making money so why not AMC?\n- Short interest over 50% - this makes it prime short squeeze material, especially with earnings on 2/27. A beat will send this thing to the moon. \n- High institutional ownership - this thing has like +90% institutional ownership. These guys aren't going to sell quickly so the number of shares owned by retail traders is tiny. Once this thing starts to squeeze it's going to be the shorts swapping a few hundred thousand shares back and forth. And that's good for anyone that's long.\n- Analyst Target price is still around $14. One analyst cut his price Target recently but he's got a 56% average of being correct. And he's apparently got a thing for whales because he's adjusted his Target for SeaWorld like 6 times. \n\n\nRisk:\n- they might cut their dividend which would be GG on share value. But that's \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b talk.\n\nThe play: \n3/20 $8 calls and $9 calls ez pz", "created_utc": 1582296756, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7c5n3/amc_is_the_stock_for_girls_and_boys_with_big/", "is_self": true}
