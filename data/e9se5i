So obvi I know what YOLOs are and the basics of calls and puts.  After the August 23rd dip I bought puts on SPY and lost a bunch of money.  Anyway, WTF are IRR, DCF, and ROIC?

Plz help me define these acronyms.", "created_utc": 1576179384, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e9se5i/applying_for_finance_job_need_help_with_weird/", "is_self": true}
