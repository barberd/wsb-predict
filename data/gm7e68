(Fool links removed by mod request)", "selftext": "# REPOST UPDATE:\n\nSo, I posted this thread before, but I got a mod auto message that seeking alpha links are banned forcing me to repost without the links, ***but the links that were under my example from the fool article did not link to seeking alpha***, they linked to the motley fool, so I guess the fool is banned on here as well, **which is good because it's shit.** (or reddit had a glitch, either way.)\n\n\\-------------------\n\nDa Motley Fool has access to the same stock information as everyone else and they have constantly put out fake articles bushing bias, or articles that were likely sponsored by the stock they are pushing and today I am calling them out and telling everyone to pretend the site doesn't exist because it's does this shit frequently. (they also steal and poorly reword other sites articles, including see king alpha which is barely a site with info as is.)\n\nExample excerpt from todays fool article on the mall rally:\n\n>Shares of mall-focused real estate investment trust **Simon Property Group** (NYSE:SPG) rose as much as 12% in the first half hour of the trading day on May 18. Following closely behind was **Macerich** (NYSE:MAC), which was up 11%, and factory outlet specialist **Tanger Factory Outlet Centers** (NYSE:SKT). Trailing a little behind this trio was **Pennsylvania REIT** (NYSE:PEI), which was up in the high single digits.\u00a0\n\nThis is an example of the Motley Fools shit and why they have among the worst track record of losses by anyone following their advice of every \"major\" (lol) investment news source.\n\nFirst of all, SPG never hit 12% this entire day and has always been in the 10% range even now as I post this thread. MAC, who fool says was \"behind\" has been at 12-14% all day. They see the same data everyone else sees, where did they get these numbers? And as this article was put out, SPG was heading toward high 9%'s just barely.\n\nOn top of this they decided to **Omit** REG and KIM from their article, ***despite including them in their last mall rally commentary***. Hmm???\n\nWhy? Because both REG and KIM were also outperforming SPG today. WOW!\n\nNotice they mention Tanger but decide against giving it a percentage like SPG and MAC? Huh?? And when this article dropped PEI wasn't in the \"high single digits\", notice they don't give a number for them as well. Pei was in reality over 10% and closing in on 11% before stabilizing and that cotinued for some time after the article dropped as well.\n\nI know what you're about to say, the article says first hour right, issue is, SPG was never at 12% in the first hour, and the highest point SPG was ever at today was during pre-market. Mac was higher at the end of the first hour as well. ***THIS IS EVEN ON THEIR OWN SCREENER ON THEIR OWN DAMN SITE.***\n\nThis is nothing more than a fake made-up hit piece to bump up SPG by the fool, or it's just a rushed, poorly written incompetent article, implying that they are making a comparison but with one example, Tanger, they don't even give us a number.\n\nThere's no info here, the fool is a trash website and it should be ashamed of itself.\n\n# SUMMARY:\n\nDa Motley Fool keeps lying and spinning numbers that don't exist in it's articles for points. They almost never have any information, which is why following their advice or ideas leads to losses, don't use them.\n\n#", "created_utc": 1589827382.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gm7e68/da_motley_fools_put_out_fake_misleading_news/", "is_self": true}
