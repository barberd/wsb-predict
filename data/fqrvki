I woke up this morning to some insteresting comments that made me rethink that thesis. Now I have doubts and a thesis that Tuesday is going to drill to the core with a double breaker (no breakers in the last 20 minutes of the day - then it can free fall).\n\nTL;DR - Do whatever you want with this, do your own research. Personally, I'm mostly long dated $SPX 2000 puts. I've been plenty wrong the last few weeks and this is some deep conspiracy shit that frightens me. I\u2019m following in the spirit of u/fuzzyblankeet and u/Variation-Separate in just putting this out there. Check my fucking history for proof.\n\nAssumptions\n\n\\- Index fund investing has been stealing all of the tendies from active fund managers. John fucking Oliver taught retail that the fund managers were fucking all of us by skimming off the top of our retirement funds and told everyone to go pure index funds. Active funds really want to kill the passive funds because those flyover country kids at Vanguard are stealing the hookers and blow $$$ from NYC.\n\n\\- Micheal \u201cBig Short\u201d Burry has been telling everyone who would listen for 6 months that index funds are creating a huge bubble in the market. Everyone knows that passive index funds have to buy billions every paycheck Friday as the money keeps rolling in to 401k accounts weekly and monthly. I don\u2019t care if he\u2019s right, a stopped clock is right twice a day, but he\u2019s already got FU private island money and you\u2019re here scratching for tendies in your mom\u2019s basement.\n\n\\- The active fund managers are also getting fucked by the quants that write algorithms that trade faster and better than 99% of prep school retards that get paid millions to manage funds. You want a job, you learn \u201cdo want fries with that\u201d in school. You want millions? You learn serious fucking math or coding in school. You want billions? Learn serious fucking math, coding, and AI in school.\n\nThe Setup\n\nActive funds (including Hedgies and all the other Billions villains) need the passive funds to lose and they have the ultimate advantage, they are not passive, so they can manipulate the market to force passive funds into a losing hand. Everyone judges funds by performance. Middle America looks at their 401k options once every 4 years and picks the funds that have the best returns over the previous 1, 5, and 10 years. They check a couple of boxes and look away, passively investing billions every year and only paying attention when the market goes GUH.\n\nThe market just went GUH. Passive investors are terrified to even look at their retirement accounts. They are going to look next week after the end of the quarter, go GUH and listen to Cramer tell them to HODOR! In 3-6 months they will take another look and make a decision to change their investments. Passive investors are going to play the same game but with a real short time search. Passive investors are going to think \u201cthat was a slaughter, I need to invest in the funds that did the best Q1, 2, and 3.\u201d\n\nThe Layup\n\nActive funds needed a massive boost last week so they could deleverage and get the fuck out of longs while building up short positions. Hedgies needed the promise of trillions to convince the Cramers to BTFD while they also hedged against the forced rebalancing that the passive funds have to do every quarter. They also needed the liquidity from the $4T Fed slush fund so they could quickly shovel of those soon to be worthless stocks onto the passive funds and the retail. They needed the bull trap last week so they could get positioned for maximum profit.\n\nFriday they finished getting positioned, they just needed the fucking bill to pass so retail would think the fix is in and want to shove all their funds back into the market. At 3:30 they sprung the trap after letting indexes go up and the VIX go down so the prices on puts would minimize and went all in on the next big short.\n\nThe Slam Dunk\n\nThe real goal line is Tuesday. End of Month, End of Quarter. EOQ is what you need to watch. Hedgies want maximum drill on Tuesday so they can pre-order next year\u2019s Gulfstream. $JPOW and his boss want maximum green so they don\u2019t get fired. Passive just has to sit back and get railed because that\u2019s the choice they made. Active funds want maximum profits and bargains ready for the looting.\n\nAll of these funds are going to live or die based on Q1 and Q2 performance. The funds that walk out of Q1 with positive numbers and well positioned for Q2 are going to have insane demand in a few months because every fucking passive and Cramer is going to want to follow the smart money while they setup the next bag to pass off to retail while they shop for private islands in their Gulfstreams.\n\nPension funds\n\nThe real suckers game and sideways factor is public pension funds. Several states realized they could pay employees less by promising them outsized pensions. Want to get paid $150k to sip margaritas on the beech? Go get elected or hired as a public employee in California. Every politician is going to drop everything to reinforce pension funds because that\u2019s the actual Houdini golden tit. Public employees fuel a lot of election campaigns. Pension funds that had been dabbling in passive vehicles like Vanguard are going to get railed, shift to the actives and the Hedgies, and Congress and the states are going to pour more trillions into propping up the golden trough of pension funds.\n\nWhat next?\n\nFuck if I know. Q2 is going to see a lot of people on the coasts fucking die and that sucks. Flyover country has been acing social distancing for decades, but they are going to suffer death and unemployment. Everything is going to be fucking weird for a few quarters unless some fucking smooth brain starts a war, cause then we\u2019ll be truly fucked. Everyone talks about the market in the 30\u2019s and displays all these great graphs about how the market in the 30\u2019s tells us exactly how this is going to fucking play out. You know how that really played out? World War Fucking 2 was fueled by the monetary crashes and desperation of the 30\u2019s.\n\nAll I\u2019m thinking about is EOQ. I had convinced myself the market would rocket giant green dildos on Tuesday to save the quarter, but I had forgotten about the Ackman\u2019s (Mr. boo fucking hoo the travel industry is going to crash, and it did, and oh yeah, I just made $2.6B profit on that crash) and the Hedgies that really do want EOQ to crater. Let\u2019s just say I have doubts and I\u2019m putting this out here to discuss.\n\nLong $ROPE 4/20 69c", "created_utc": 1585427409.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqrvki/the_war_of_the_bankers_or_how_the_hedgies_are/", "is_self": true}
