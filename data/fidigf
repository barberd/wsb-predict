Based on current life expectancy, even the healthiest individuals on earth will not be here when the restock hits. 23,000 years is a very long time I doubt they will be able to keep the stores running or the memberships active when there are no products for anyone to buy. \n\nThank me for the tendies later", "created_utc": 1584163010.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fidigf/costco_is_having_serious_supply_chains_issues_dd/", "is_self": true}
