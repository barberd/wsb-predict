{"id": "dyeohh", "title": "ROKU Expert Analysis", "selftext": "Alright listen up shitheads! Since the algos decided to trigger a 30 minute selloff this morning I\u2019ve decided to do a little time-series analysis. I know you\u2019re not gonna wanna hear this but ROKU is going to the MOON! You can wipe your ass with those filthy puts. As you can see from my iN-dEpTh aNaLySiS, past growth can be approximated using OLS regression, growth from June through August can be predicted by a Fibonacci spiral, and performance immediately after an all-time high can be predicted with an equilateral triangle/pitchfork. So put your pitchforks back in the shed and buy CALLS. As you can see from the certainty of making $$$ cone, will be trading at $191 before year end. Personally buying 10 calls 20 DEC strike 160 at open. Should make at least 23k on this one, who\u2019s with me?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v955ns089kz31.png?width=3035&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c713e30d229bd52d2c479ed5cb7af4fdab34a28", "created_utc": 1574133726, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dyeohh/roku_expert_analysis/", "is_self": true}
