I\u2019m looking to build it from the ground up with people and willing to make people Admins and Mods over time. The group is called \u201cWall Street Thoughts\ud83d\udcad\u201d since I can only invite people I am already friends with I am going to link the group and if you request to join and answer the one question you will be automatically accepted in.
