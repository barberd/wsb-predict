{"id": "chof4v", "title": "Short WDC", "selftext": "WDC gets lumped into semiconductors because they recently got into making NAND flash. However, 2/3rds of their revenue still comes from spinning media hard disk drives.\n\nBasically, I think analysts are incorrectly pricing WDC as if it were a pure semi company when it's only a 1/3rd semi company. And... I think they're going to sell fewer hard drives now and forever into the future.\n\nIn short, I think they're over-valued and have ratings that are too good for reality.
