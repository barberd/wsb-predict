{"id": "c23enw", "title": "$CZR Sale", "selftext": "Shares are currently trading at 10$ after huge rumors have been cited of a buyout. $ERI was previously going to buy them for 11-12$ a share which was turned down however rumors have just dropped that Carl Icahn has accepted a bid for 10.50 (creating weird bidding war probably ending in $ ERI initial offer of 12$ a share.) They most likely will get acquired buy ERI in a weird structured buyout (have no clue how this works but doesn\u2019t matter) and will be bought at 12 a share but nobody knows the exact date. There\u2019s a shareholder meeting next Monday as well. Buy calls haha easy ride to the top boys. HUGE BuY ThE RUmOr opportunity. \n\nDisclaimer: I\u2019m currently holding June 28 9.50 calls and June 21 and July 5 10.50 calls.
