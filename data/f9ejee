There is a an over 75% chance to gain tendies selling puts on $jcp at the $0.50 strike price. In the event that you do end up getting assigned $jcp, you literally just sell $1.00 strike price cover calls for fat gains. Sell cash-covered puts, get assigned, sell covered calls, exercise, rinse and repeat for fat tendies gain. Those volume numbers are looking pretty low for such a really amazing opportunity. The reason being is that when you do get assigned at the $0.50 strike price the company will have to bring it back up to at least $1.00 strike price to stay listed on NYSE. Simple statistics and probability for fat gains of +50%.
