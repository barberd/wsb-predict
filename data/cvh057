{"id": "cvh057", "title": "Facebook (FB) DD", "selftext": "I live in Japan, where there is a constant stream of recent college graduates moving here to teach English. They are not smart people. They don't have careers lined up. They don't know how to do taxes; their parents do their taxes for them. They got their degree in Communications, Teaching, Psychology, some sort of Liberal Arts.  The people with STEM degrees are viewed as suspicious and possibly pedophiles. These people are too high on the spectrum to be considered $BECKY, but we're still talking common folk.\n\nThey ALL use Facebook. But here's the important thing. They use it to organize parties. When they leave Japan after wising up, they use FB's marketplace to sell their furniture and other shit they bought. You don't have that functionality on Instagram or Snapchat. Even MySpace didn't have a marketplace, and IIRC events were mainly public events like concerts.\n\nPeople here like to say FB is for BECKY's mom, and maybe there are tweens that recognize how toxic FB is,  but where I'm at I see an monopolized ecosystem that is teeming with activity and used by all the young people.", "created_utc": 1566781021, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cvh057/facebook_fb_dd/", "is_self": true}
