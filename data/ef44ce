SHYT will allow owners to rent their toilets for use by others, providing them a steady \"stream\" of secondary income and decreasing toilet \"congestion\" and waiting times at busy offices.  Users will use an app to hail available toilets in their vicinity, and rate their experience based on cleanliness, accommodation, and flush response.  SHYT's revolutionary AI algorithms will optimize toilet utilization, and apply surge pricing when toilets are in high demand.\n\nSHYT aims to corner the market by signing up 100,000 toilets across 50 metropolitan areas in its first year, and is raising funds from VCs and private equity, led by SoftBank, at a $10B valuation.", "created_utc": 1577207635, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ef44ce/kalanick_leaves_uber_to_start_peertopeer_toilet/", "is_self": true}
