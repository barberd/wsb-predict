{"id": "gpcvcd", "title": "The case for Dart Group plc (actual real DD that's not a meme)", "selftext": "TLDR: Dart Group is traded on the London stock exchange and is a very strong package holiday airline company that is underpriced as fuck and will easily increase 200% by my predictions. I am not trying to shill the stock, I am just giving a recommendation for a 12 month investment that I fully believe in. \n\n**INTRODUCTION**: Dart Group run a major package holiday company in the UK called [Jet2](https://www.jet2holidays.com/), they operate the airline part and coordinate with hotels to arrange bookings. Before COVID-19, a major UK airline holiday company called Thomas Cook went bust and Jet2 got all of their routes and business, seeing sales shoot up rapidly.  Throughout this I will be referring to Dartgroup as JET2 as this is their commercial name. \n\n**FUNDAMENTALS:** Dart Group operate flights and arrange package holidays, revenue has grown by 50% since 2017. They also operate a food delivery business which has acted as a hedge against their holiday business as everyone in the UK has been panic buying food, providing a good bit of extra cash flow for the business (although their distribution revenue doesn't provide [much cash right now, its a diverse revenue stream for the future](https://www.dartgroup.co.uk/Investor_Relations/News/Final_Results__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________11_July_2019/). \n\n**BULLISH CASE:**\n\nThe stock price crashed from 1700p (yes its traded in London so its in pence) to around 300p and apparently the company sent emails to staff recommending everyone to buy shares which I saw on reddit so this may be questionable information. The company has over \u00a31 billion in cash compared to a total 2019 operating expense of \u00a33 billion which is when the company was operating all of its planes and business. Now the company is doing nothing and massively trimming cash bleed which is easy because they own their planes instead of leasing them and dont have any rent to pay as they dont own hotels.  Plus, in order to raise even more cash they did a small stock offering last week and the PRICE INCREASED by another 10%, I think normally dilution causes a decrease so this might be a bullish indicator of people jumping on board. They also received EVEN MORE cash from the UK government without any conditions - [extra \u00a3300 million from the government](https://www.flightglobal.com/strategy/jet2-owner-accesses-300m-uk-government-loan/138391.article) \\- this is not a rescue loan AS IT IS GIVEN REGARDLESS OF THE CONDITION OF THE COMPANY, it is a standard support loan offered to many UK companies.  - The UK government has a loan programme that isn't based on rescuing businesses but simply supporting them so this is bullish news as it further adds to Dart Group cash position. [UK government support loan programme](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/financial-support-for-businesses-during-coronavirus-covid-19)\n\n**PERSONAL DD -** I live in the UK and can say everybody uses JET2, they provide the cheapest and best holidays, also competition is limited now their major competition (Thomas Cook) has gone bankrupt. I booked a holiday for June and they emailed me at the start of May saying i could have a full cash refund no problem. Now when I say everyone uses JET2, I can confidently predict there is going to be a mad rush for package holidays as soon as they are allowed. Half the British public thinks the virus is overblown to shit and on our hottest day of the year last week our local beaches were absolutely crowded, [here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQIDcsQ_hhk) of a British beach last week even though mass gatherings are technically still not allowed. Nobody cares about social distancing and will jump on package holidays when they are open, also they are aimed at low cost travel so wont be affected by loss of income (The UK government has been paying everyone's wages anyway)\n\n**FUTURE -** The stock price jumped from 490 to 700 last week which still puts it at 60% down since January, the British public will rush to fly out to France and Spain as soon as they are allowed and JET2 (Dart Group) will be their main port of call. Major parts of Europe are heavily dependant on tourism and will be looking to have alot of places [this summer](https://kslnewsradio.com/1925570/europe-promises-to-reopen-for-summer-tourism-in-wake-of-coronavirus/), the lack of tourism revenue is already sending Italy spiralling into a depression and the EU will do everything they can to encourage British and Germans to go on holiday in the south of Europe which will otherwise see a massive hit to revenues (the governments have a tourism tax in Greece, Spain and Italy [that they are heavily reliant on](https://www.lovemoney.com/guides/52231/tourist-tax-in-europe-what-you-will-pay-in-spain-italy-and-other-hotspots).) Therefore the EU will really push for tourism this year and the British people will be eager to go on holiday. It is worth mentioning that alot of these package holidays are focused to be low cost and can be paid as loans over a long period which means a drop in household income wont be a problem since people will be desperate to get out the house and to a European beach. \n\n**MY MOVES -** I reckon the price will be pretty unstable for the next few months and then rocket upwards when people realise JET2 (Dart Group) will benefit from the surge in package holidays in the late summer. Due to volatility, I'm going to buy a large amount of stock and ride it out till 2021 or longer when the stock price should stabilise back to January 2020 levels. I couldn't even name any competitors for Jet2 (Dart Group) at this point, they are the dominator of the market for package holidays and have the lowest cost business model due to not renting planes or hotel property. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR -** I guess everyone just jumped to this section so let me bullet point it for you guys\n\n\\- **VERY STRONG BALANCE SHEET - CASH HEAVY - THEY HAVE MORE CASH THAN THEIR ENTIRE MARKET CAPITILISATION**\n\n**- BUILDING A DIVERSIFIED INCOME STREAM TO HEDGE HOLIDAY BUSINESS**\n\n\\- **EUROPE DESPERATE FOR A SUMMER HOLIDAY SEASON IN JULY/AUGUST/SEPTEMBER -** [Tourism is 10% of Europes GDP](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-eu-travel/europe-needs-a-break-eu-plots-to-restart-travel-and-tourism-despite-covid-idUKKBN22L0ET) and governments are really pushing for it this year\n\n\\- **THEY RUN THE GO TO PACKAGE HOLIDAY SERVICE FOR ALL YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE UK** \n\n**- STOCK JUMPED 10% AFTER A SMALL STOCK OFFERING WHICH I THINK IS BULLISH** \n\n**- STILL DOWN 60% ON THE YEAR**\n\n**- GIVEN STANDARD GOVERNMENT SUPPORT LOAN of \u00a3300 million which means total cash is \u00a31.3 billion (a lot considering the company has a market capitalisation of only \u00a31.01 billion.** \n\n\\- I believe this has been slept on partially because its mainly owned by institutional investors that had to limit their exposure to COVID-19 so had no choice but to dump the stock.", "created_utc": 1590268747.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gpcvcd/the_case_for_dart_group_plc_actual_real_dd_thats/", "is_self": true}
