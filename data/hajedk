I feign friendliness at those horrible bitches because I do not want to get into a pissing match with a Karen they have no morals or ethics and will burn my house down like left eye.  \nThe number one local Karen fear of the summer BY FAR is what they are going to do with their obnoxious Karen brood in the fall because they don\u2019t like how the schools are planning on opening and they have to keep little Chad and little Karen part II safe from the virus.  A bunch of them are going to try homeschool because they \u201cgot computers and stuff.\u201d  It\u2019s good to see the circle of life of one idiot passing their idiocy to their offspring but these bitches are going to do it! At least for a semester.  \nChegg is bullshit like a cliffsnote  and Pearson is drowning in awful debt.  LRN runs about 60% of online for profit schools for our little Karen\u2019s and Chads of the future.  If I have learned one thing is that Karen\u2019s got money and they will pay anything if they think it will help their kids into college.
