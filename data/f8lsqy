{"id": "f8lsqy", "title": "DD TOOL: Python Unusual Activity Screener", "selftext": "This is something I've seen on everyone's wishlist for a while but no one ever stepped up to code it really. Well merry Christmas tards because it was fucking easy. You can view, run and download the notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cnyERosVMoxo2Q0wT3gWvKnzh85FThNg) and you should be good as long as you have a Google account. Let's take a peak under the hood:\n\nEssentially what we're doing is looping over the whole fuckin S&amp;P 500 and looking for options for a given expiration that have a reasonable open interest (&gt; 200) and their volume/open interest on the last trading day is notable (&gt;.5). I don't know that this is the best criteria, but I encourage you to mess around with the filters and add some of your own.\n\nOnce you run the code, you can download a csv of the data and mess around with it how you like. It's interesting to look at the V/OI as well as the value of the open interest. I about shit my pants when I saw someone buy 500 AMAT 3/20 $45s since they're $19 OTM but then saw that those contracts are going for like 5 cents.\n\nIn terms of top V/OI let's take a look at what's going on for 2/28:\n\n|Symbol|stock\\_price|strike|% OTM|lastPrice|volume|openInterest|impliedVolatility|V/OI|Value|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|WYNN|127.95|123|3.87%|1.32|3915|220|0.549|17.80|$29,040|\n|WYNN|127.95|124|3.09%|1.61|3659|343|0.544|10.67|$55,223|\n|ABT|87.45|88|\\-0.63%|1.2|2414|296|0.219|8.16|$35,520|\n|AMD|53.28|52.5|1.46%|1.19|4398|634|0.623|6.94|$75,446|\n|AMZN|2095.97|2090|0.28%|27.25|1606|249|0.317|6.45|$678,525|\n|NOW|344.48|330|4.20%|1.95|2146|350|0.443|6.13|$68,250|\n|AMD|53.28|53|0.53%|1.38|6545|1096|0.615|5.97|$151,248|\n|AMZN|2095.97|2120|\\-1.15%|43.17|1905|329|0.317|5.79|$1,420,293|\n|CCL|41.69|42|\\-0.74%|0.91|2905|514|0.402|5.65|$46,774|\n\nWe can see that this week people are betting big against Wynn, Carnival and some tech names. Maybe you can hop on these on Monday and make money, I don't know.\n\nAs I say in the code, this shit's free for you to use and feel free to DM me with questions that aren't \"can you teach me how to code\". I especially look forwarded to suggestions that are **already coded**. \n\nAlso, if you find some free money please let me/everyone else know.
