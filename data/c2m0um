It does all of this autonomously\u2014while running\u2014without the need for any human intervention, and without the need for any downtime. No other cloud infrastructure provides anything close to these autonomous features.\"\n\nThe Board of Directors also declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share of outstanding common stock.
