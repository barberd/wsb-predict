{"id": "hfq06z", "title": "PCG Stock Offering at $10.46 (Higher than $9.5 Expected)", "selftext": "Reposting this since I was wrong this morning. The offering is actually $10.46 to backstop parties, institutions, and funds, which is higher than the expected $9.5-10 range.\n\nThat means now the backstop underwriters will purchase any remaining shares at 10.46 by July 1st. PCG will now fully exit bankruptcy 7/1, and the optional 400m shares will be acquired by the underwriters.\n\nAfter the exit, funds and other excluded investors who couldn't buy while in bankruptcy will come in.\n\nExpect this to moon now that the entrenched backstop party has no more incentive to suppress prices.\n\nThe volume has been astronomical the past 2 days, the short squeeze will be ridiculous.\n\nWish I can post a picture, but it's in there under today's 8-K, scroll towards the end, and you'll see \"Schedule of Forward Stock Purchase Agreements\"\n\nhttp://investor.pgecorp.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx\n\nI believe share prices will climb back to at least $10 by end of day.", "created_utc": 1593105323.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hfq06z/pcg_stock_offering_at_1046_higher_than_95_expected/", "is_self": true}
