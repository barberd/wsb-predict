I had SPY options expiring that Monday that expired worthless because of RH\u2019s incompetence.\n\nThey reached out a month later with a form to fill out to provide explicit details about the losses I incurred. I filled it out with painstaking detail. \n\nNow, about a week later, they got back to me and are giving me about 80% of what I could\u2019ve had without their outages. Honestly, who knows what I would\u2019ve done had the platform been working, I probably would\u2019ve found a way to lose more. That being said, I\u2019m getting $1.2k from them and not going to complain. I have no idea how they actually calculated the reimbursement but it seems fair enough and I\u2019m just surprised to get anything out of them. \n\nAnyone that incurred losses from their outages, reach out to them and try to fill out that form. Apparently they\u2019re willing to give away a reasonable amount of tendies. You have to submit the form by 4/24 according to the email I got from them. \n\nTL;DR: RH said sorry for not working and is giving out tendies.
