Tell me why I'm wrong.", "selftext": "Following an up 27% year and a 9 year bull market, the SPY ended December at levels some would call \"bubblicious.\"  There were good reasons to support high valuations - low rates, accomodative fed, massive share repurchases, lots of leverage, accomodative fiscal policy, little sign of inflation, and a business-friendly administration to name a few.  But everything changed with Covid19.  The economy almost halted and I don't need to cite the rest.  \n\nWe're now down 12% for the year on the SPY despite the fact that we're in the midst of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.  Sure, the market has priced in the immediate bad economic news in current numbers and the unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus.  But at -12%, the market is saying \"this ain't so bad, and it's going to go back to normal soon\" and it just isn't so.  \n\nAn overlevered economy facing a mild contraction is scary.  We sit in an overlevered economy in the middle of a massive contraction.  There are two things that the market doesn't appreciate in my view:  1) The lockdown will be over soon but spending (consumer and biz) will not return to normal for a year or more.  2) related to that point is the fact that economic underperformance is going to drag on for 1 year+ (probably much longer given the contraction that is coming).  \n\nThe market is betting that the Fed Put has once again saved investors.  What the market doesn't get is that the Fed can't make people spend money.  The Fed can create an environment conducive to spending, and it can influence psychology to a degree.  But the fed can't make my wife want to go out to dinner.  The Fed can't make us take a vacation.  The Fed can't make that CEO invest in a new plant.  You get the idea.  \n\nThis market will go much lower when investors start to sense that the Fed is powerless to stimulate aggregate demand - it is pushing on a string.  The Fed Put isn't going to rescue us this time.  And an overlevered economy with lots of excess capacity is going to be deflationary.  It won't take long.  \n\nTell me why I'm wrong.", "created_utc": 1587825203.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7ugd9/where_to_from_here_tell_me_why_im_wrong/", "is_self": true}
