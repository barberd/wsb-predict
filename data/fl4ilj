It's truly amazing what this community can do when it gets together for a good cause.\n\nwallstreetbooyah did a terrific job putting it all together. He had very interesting guests while he was day trading live, which included a British  immunologist living in China, CEO of streamlabs, various WSB mods and some surprise boomer which apparently stole the entire show. Also according to Mr. Booyah, he made some tendies but that's yet to be confirmed.\n\nIf you're in quarantine and can spare a few minutes (or 9 hours to be exact) you can watch the recording of the stream here https://youtu.be/Ma0yMGeFeRo\nAnd if you want to skip straight to the celebrity boomer, go to 3hr 55min mark. \n\nAs of now, donations are still open so if you missed out today and want to make a donation, here's the link https://donate.tiltify.com/@wallstreetbooyah/wsb-charity-for-autism\n\n[link to the original livestream thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkoskv/the_rwallstreetbets_charity_live_stream/)", "created_utc": 1584595128.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fl4ilj/3476469_thanks_wsb_and_uwallstreetbooyah_thats/", "is_self": true}
