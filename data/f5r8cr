But here me out on this one gents. These bat eating bastards are locked up in their homes and are in compete austerity mode. They want to spend just like Americans do, on credit. And who will extend it? $BABA! And it is high stakes. If you dont pay your bills, you get to go to the death camps... umh umh umh... I mean Foxconn.\n\nJust like the Irish and Greeks, when the Germans and EU placed them in timeout for being, and stopped drinking to save money, they went on a weekend long bender that has been going on for +7 years now. Just think, all Of China buying their stuff online, and $BABA will be your first as State Media will only advertised for them.\n\nLong way of saying, stonks only go up... and $BABA to be next to join the Trillion Dollar country club!", "created_utc": 1582029805, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f5r8cr/baba_covid19_a_fed_up_bull_case/", "is_self": true}
