We\u2019ll hold enough cash or stock to cover your option position until the order is canceled. If an order is filled that requires additional collateral, Robinhood will hold the credit that you received from opening the order plus any additional necessary collateral. The collateral we hold for these purposes is not marginable.\n\nOrders placed outside of market hours are pending and limit orders don\u2019t guarantee execution. For example, orders placed outside of the current bid/ask spread have a low probability of being filled during market hours. Keep in mind that Monday's opening prices may differ from Friday's closing prices.\"\n\nWe got the go ahead boys", "created_utc": 1575256709, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e4sss9/rh_says_new_infinite_leverage_glitch_is_not_a_bug/", "is_self": true}
