Covet his cocaine, hookers, and tendies instead.  Be nice and make friends, maybe he'll share. \r\n3.\tThou shalt not worship any tendies before me. \r\n4.\tThou shalt not use the name of thy tendies in vain. \r\n5.\tThou shalt YOLO with moderation.\r\n6.\tAll tendies are not created equal, but people are.  Treat them as such.\r\n7.\tHonor thy father and mother.  Doing so means more tendies when they die.\r\n8.\tEat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die. \r\n9.\tElon shall not be crossed.\r\n10. Beware false claims that do not include \u201cTo the Moon\" for such claims are the work of the devil.", "created_utc": 1579718776, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/esg93g/10_commandments_for_the_church_of_tendies/", "is_self": true}
