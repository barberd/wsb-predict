I was the horniest bull there possibly was; then, everything changed when the corona virus attacked. My NVDA and AMD calls were dropping faster than posthumous XXXTentacion albums. In the heat of the moment today, I loaded up on SPY, MSFT, and DIS puts, they kept dropping so I just kept buying, eventually my entire Robinhood account and 401k were puts. I realized that it was all a facade and I was the gayest bear you could possibly be \ud83d\udc3b \ud83c\udf08 uwu. AITA for not telling my boyfriend? My heels were clicking all day at work waiting for 3:50pm, while I was in the red half of the day. When the time finally approached and SPY jumped up 8 points (seriously, like what the fuck?), I realized that I was severely autistic; however, this wasn\u2019t just normal severe autism, but ADVANCED sever autism. The kind where I only have until 3/6 to live. Therefore, I\u2019m asking Donald Trump to take one for the team and voluntarily contract the corona virus so I can die smelling the sweet scent of chicken tenderloins one last time. \n\nTLDR: Pigs get slaughtered\nTLDRTLDR: GPRO 3/6 $9 calls", "created_utc": 1582947382, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fb6o2g/makeawish_donald_trump/", "is_self": true}
