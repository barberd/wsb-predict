Late last year to early this year I put it all on SPCE and more than doubled my money. I thought I had the game figured out. Find meme stocks before anyone else and ride the sweet tendie wave. I was euphoric.\n\nSince then I've lost well over a 100k mainly on puts cause the economy is collapsing, but since buying them the market is ripping.  \n\nI also went balls deep on LK recently because I'm a mega autist, and when I see a company drop 80%+ down to 6 bucks from its ATH of 50 I start thinking, \"man if this goes back to its all time high I'll be fucking rich!\" Currently down 35% and halted. So a huge portion of my money is tied up till forever or gone. \n\nThe problem with winning big is you get a God complex. \"I can keep doubling my money\" I'd tell myself. Climbing higher towards that sun. Well the wings of wax have finally melted my fellow autists, and dare I say, friends. The wings have melted.
