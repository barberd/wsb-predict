This morning when i opened robinhood, it was showing a $4,000 dollar increase for about 30 minutes. When I went to view the other bids, I was notified that they could be closed but not bought, and the options were renamed to NVS1. \n\nAfter a quick search it looks like there was an offering of ALC to Novartis holders. 10 ALC calls are now in my account and are identical. Can someone explain the spike this morning (seeing that option buys were halted) and maybe give some insight as to what this means?  Good news? Ok news? Bad news? \n\nHere is a link that may help explain what I am holding\n\n\n\nhttps://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.miaxoptions.com/sites/default/files/alert-files/NVS_Distribution_44797.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiGvZik98PhAhUtzlkKHS9CARMQFjAAegQIBRAC&amp;usg=AOvVaw159NeDL7SpyGTsSg8RtelT", "created_utc": 1554844639, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bbdige/help_with_options_what_is_going_on_with_my_719/", "is_self": true}
