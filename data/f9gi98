You may as well piss on the American Flag as it waves over the World Trade Center.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to short something, short the EUROPEAN MARKET. Beer virus already making the Italians freak out, economy already slowing over there, and Europe is super connected country to country. No way this thing causes issues in Italy only and not the whole Eurozone. \n\nOr the INDIAN market. If it takes hold there the Indians are more fucked than the Chinese with their crowded ass cities, but their market is shit anyway so idk if that\u2019s the best play. \n\nBe a real American hero, buy $SPY for the long haul and short Europe because they\u2019re going to panic the fuck out very soon. \n\nI won\u2019t be buying puts because it\u2019s not my style, but if you\u2019re going to do it, do it on foreign soil so you can have a shred of dignity left", "created_utc": 1582662197, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9gi98/you_unamerican_fucks_listen_up/", "is_self": true}
