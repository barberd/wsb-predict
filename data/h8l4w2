{"id": "h8l4w2", "title": "Ford Strangles", "selftext": "Ford has been trending as the top stock on RH: [https://robinhood.com/collections/100-most-popular](https://robinhood.com/collections/100-most-popular) on its most popular list.  Boomers have also been piling in lured by what they see as a cheap dividend stock.\n\nWill fundamental economics and the law of financial gravity pay off on F bears?  Or will meme strength and FOMO greed win out for the F bulls?\n\nWhy bother trying to bet on it?  Instead open a long strangle position.  I am looking at F 7/17 6p and 7c.   Last time I checked on the closing prices they were about \\~$38/contract each.Thoughts?\n\nEDIT:  rough math tell us the stock needs to move 11.7% or more to be profitable in either direction.  (38+38)/$6.46 closing price = 11.7%.  Ideally I prefer to open strangles on stocks with <10% but F seems to be  a promising candidate b/c of its popularity - no doubt due in large part to its low price and iconic name across all generations.  \n\nThey also have an EV  division which will either end in flaming failure to compete with TSLA or bring them back to at least the teens.  But that is long term speculation and I am just looking at this within a 1 month time window for a trade.
