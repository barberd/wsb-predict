{"id": "fpbi7a", "title": "Coronavirus kills more than the official stats suggest", "selftext": "Hello fellow retards, since I'm italian I can provide you with fresh news coming from the first analysis of mortality in the most affected areas (province of Bergamo in Lombardia) compared to the previous years.\n\n\nThere are data available for two places: Nembro (population: 11,000) and Bergamo (population: 120,000). \n\nNembro was one of the town were the outbreak started (it is the equivalent of New Rochelle in New York), Bergamo is the closest city and where the main hospitals are. Bergamo later on became the most affected city in Italy. \n\n\nFirst, the town, Nembro (January 1st - March 24th 2020) :\n\nOFFICIAL DEATHS COVID-19: 31\n\n\nOFFICIAL DEATHS: 158\n\n\nAVERAGE NUMBER OF DEATHS (2015-2019): 35\n\nYou can see the daily trend here (red: deaths 2020, green: official coronavirus-related deaths, blue: historical number of deaths):\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/8usP90W.jpg\n\n\nSecond, the small city, Bergamo (January 1st - March 19th 2020):\n\nOFFICIAL DEATHS COVID-19: 48\n\n\nOFFICIAL DEATHS: 1128\n\n\nAVERAGE NUMBER OF DEATHS (2015-2019): 628\n\n\nSource: https://i.imgur.com/HGqiRv5.jpg\n\n\nTLDR: Deaths are x5 the average in a town in Italy and x2 the average in a small city (data still missing tho, it will get worse). The official stats of death related to coronavirus are much lower. \nThis can be explained by two factors:\n\n- people are dying of other things because the hospitals are overcrowded and they cannot be treated\n\n\n- people are dying of coronavirus but it's not possible to test them all.", "created_utc": 1585229374.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpbi7a/coronavirus_kills_more_than_the_official_stats/", "is_self": true}
