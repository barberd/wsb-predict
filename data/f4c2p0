Last few days have been shitty due to the earnings sell off ( they beat ) that was then followed up by a hit piece that wasn\u2019t even supposed to be directed at them specifically made by none of then the Wall Street journal the very next day. A put sweep happened while they were all basically pennies right before the article issue was released. \n\nThey received three rating changes a day after earnings.\n\nOppenheimer : \u201cKeeps\u201d OUTPERFORMING Rating \n\n$16 from $12 \n\nSuntrust : \u201cReiterates\u201d HOLD Rating \n\n$13 from $9\n\nBoA: \u201cMaintains\u201d UNDERPERFORMING Rating\n\n$11 from $8 \n\nSpeaking about that, the hit piece I was talking about earlier on, by wsj.. it was basically saying a Proposal, not an \u201coffer\u201d was rejected as 75% of the state attorneys general need to be in agreement for the settlement to go thru (37.5 is 75% of 50) . That means 29 out of 50 agreed on a 18 billion \u201cdollar\u201d which is actually a 250 million in cash and 1.75bln in generic drugs. Which they can produce out of their asshole.\n\n10:50 am EST \u201c UPDATE 1-21 states reject $18 bln offer from U.S. distributors to settle opioid lawsuits - WSJ \u201c\n\n 11:20 EST \u201c UPDATE 2-21 states reject $18 bln offer from U.S. distributors to settle opioid lawsuits - WSJ \u201c\n\n 1:00 pm EST \u201c UPDATE 3-U.S. states reject $18 bln proposal to settle opioid lawsuits, discussions ongoing -sources \u201c\n\n2:00 pm EST \u201c UPDATE 4-U.S. states reject $18 bln proposal to settle opioid lawsuits, discussions ongoing -sources \u201c\n\nThey changed the article title 4 times throughout the day so they obviously wanted to create panic with those titles and also added in their final update.. \u201cWe're far along in the process of talks and still negotiating,\" said Sarah Lovenheim, spokeswoman for California Attorney General Xavier Becerra. \"For anyone to suggest otherwise would be inaccurate.\" After an Attorneys general had to speak up about the misinformation being blatantly spread.\n\n\nWhat the consensus for how much they would agree on is 22-32 bln,  but \u201capparently\u201d (sarcastic screeching) negotiations are still on going. They have been in this settlement dispute for a couple of years now so it\u2019s only a matter of time before 8 more attorneys general to start caring about the well being of their citizens. It also helps that they saved the US people 41 bln this year alone.\n\n\nFrom the 4th and last Update: The states want the companies - AmerisourceBergen Corp , McKesson Corp and Cardinal Health Inc - to pay between $22 billion and $32 billion, the WSJ reported https://on.wsj.com/37kSRkA, citing a person familiar with a matter.\n\nStates also want the money faster than the companies' proposal, which was for $18 billion over 18 years, one of the sources told Reuters. The state attorneys general believe distributors can pay more than $18 billion dollars over a shorter period of time, the person said.\n\nThose companies (AmerisourceBergen Corp , McKesson Corp and Cardinal Health Inc) listed fell about 1 % in total (excluding teva pharmaceuticals as it was failed to be mentioned in the last few of already vague updates) those same company\u2019s rose back to where they were trading 11pm before the article was issued. What\u2019s this mean? Shit was priced in from the beginning. \n\nAnd for a speculative play for the while, The US was considering using their distributor links to make vaccines for coronavirus.. Teva does produce the most generics,  so it wouldn\u2019t be out of the question to ask for help seeing how they\u2019re currently in a lawsuit for over production lol\n\nOh and recently reported in his 13f, Warren buffet who has a average share price of above 20 dollars didn\u2019t sell. This stock hasn\u2019t been 20 dollars since  almost a 2 years ago. \n\nTLDR: Buy Calls at open, this sell off after they reported earnings is about to become a shooting star this next week leading the turnaround.", "created_utc": 1581785756, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f4c2p0/your_morning_coffee_teva/", "is_self": true}
