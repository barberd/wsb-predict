We will probably crack 100,000 total cases tomorrow and experts expect that number to rise EXPONENTIALLY over the weekend due to the availability of test kits. Markets are pricing in another rate cut after the next fed meeting this month. Small businesses, restaurants, tourism, and financials are getting murdered but several industries (such as insurance companies) will see downstream impacts in the coming months. \n\nExpectation - Market will be extremely volatile tomorrow (duh) with likely swings from positive to negative. Especially if we get a strong jobs report (but who gives a fuck because it\u2019s pre-corona data & the majority of growth is in industries that will be impacted most).\n\nStrategy - Buy as many FD\u2019s as possible. Focus on auto, insurance, hotel/casino (anything Las Vegas), airlines, & financials.  \n\nFD FRIDAY FUCKERS", "created_utc": 1583464798.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fe7bue/fd_friday/", "is_self": true}
