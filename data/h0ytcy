{"id": "h0ytcy", "title": "The liquidity trap: how QE and low rates might be inadvertently causing deflation", "selftext": "\u201cDon\u2019t fight the Fed.\u201d That mantra is repeated as fact amongst almost every market participant across the globe (other than Davey Day Trader, who doesn\u2019t know what a central bank is). Based off of that logic, one could reasonably assume that the Fed and Jerome Powell are the reasons for this recent market rally. All of WSB is bullish, and you can\u2019t go more than four posts on WSB without seeing some exhausted money printer meme or a pro-Powell love fest. After a week of reading economic research papers nonstop, I think I have stumbled into something that the market and the Fed won\u2019t see until it is too late to stop.\n\nFull disclosure: I am not an expert and this post should not be construed as anything other than my opinions and theories. This will be an extremely long and conceptual post (with a lot of references to research papers) that focuses more on economics than any financial analysis. It is not hard to understand, but be prepared to read.\n\n**Fed Reaction to Coronavirus**\n\nThe Fed\u2019s reaction to coronavirus was extremely quick. After seeing what worked to stop the financial crisis in 2008, the Fed used the same playbook. Lower rates to near zero, buy treasuries (quantitative easing), buy mortgage backed securities, cut the reserve ratio to 0%. That playbook didn\u2019t work though, the market kept selling off though. The Fed then did something unprecedented, they started buying corporate bond ETFs. They only bought high grade corporate bonds at first, but quickly realized that they had to buy junk bonds in order to keep the corporate bond market stabilized. Recently, the Fed [quietly announced](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-mainstreet/fed-eases-terms-of-main-street-loans-tells-banks-to-start-disbursing-idUSKBN23F2N8) a ramp up of their Main Street lending program, along with guaranteeing 95% of the loans instead of a range of 85-95%. This implies, to me, that banks don\u2019t want to give out loans unless the Fed backstops them more. That will become important later in this post.\n\nThe Fed has also been buying commercial mortgage backed securities. These CMBSs are facing [extremely high levels of delinquency](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/cmbs-delinquencies-climb-in-may-with-hotels-and-retail-faring-worst-58714661). According to that article, 7.6% of all CMBS loans are delinquent as of May, along with 19.3% of hotel loans and 10% of retail loans. A [whistleblower report]{https://www.propublica.org/article/whistleblower-wall-street-has-engaged-in-widespread-manipulation-of-mortgage-funds) indicates that the loans in these securities did not go through much scrutiny and could be massively overpriced as well. These assets are so toxic that the Fed [won\u2019t even take that many of them](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/agency-commercial-mortgage-backed-securities/agency-commercial-mortgage-backed-securities-operations). In fact, the Fed has quietly [reduced their asset purchases](https://i.imgur.com/zlMFwbr.jpg) since the last week of March. This is just background information so I can explain what the Fed has been doing to the market so people can stop attributing the rally to Jerome Powell.\n\n**Reasons For the Rally**\n\nNow that I have explained what the Fed has been doing, I want to explain the reasons for this rally. This rally is driven by retail. How? Delta hedging. Some of you know about delta hedging, but for those who don\u2019t I will explain a quick summary. A retail investors buys a call from a market maker. That market maker, being more risk averse than we are accustomed to, doesn\u2019t like to sell naked options so the market maker will buy enough shares to become delta neutral. That means that as the call they sold goes up in price, they have shares that will cover most or all of their losses. Options are highly leveraged instruments, which is important because it gives retail the leverage that they need to get market makers to pump the market for them.\n\nThe important thing is that the analysts and value investors that are crediting the Fed for this rally don\u2019t understand the options market as well as degenerates like us do. Retail has been [piling in](https://i.imgur.com/xuzFRSw.jpg) to the stock market at an astounding rate, especially into everyone\u2019s favorite [broker](https://i.imgur.com/mNve5Mu.jpg). This data is as of the beginning of May and I suspect it\u2019s a hell of a lot higher. \n\nBloomberg published some more up to date data recently regarding small option traders buying calls. Take a look at [the graph](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ixvGtK3QI_Aw/v0/1400x-1.png) for yourself, it has gone parabolic. The [Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-09/speculative-fervor-in-u-s-stocks-surges-to-stunning-levels) states, \u201cTraders established fresh bullish positions last week by buying 35.6 million new call options on equities, according to Sundial founder Jason Goepfert. That\u2019s up from a peak of 28.7 million in February, when speculative activity was rampant, he wrote in a note Monday.\u201d The volume from small options traders is estimated to be 50% in that same article, the highest since 2000. Google Trends for [\u201chow to trade options\u201d](https://i.imgur.com/6nf8LTw.png) and [\u201crobinhood trade options\u201d](https://i.imgur.com/4NJwVfh.png) have gone parabolic recently as well. The put/call ratio across all equities is also at [historic lows](https://c.stockcharts.com/c-sc/sc?s=%24CPCE&p=D&b=5&g=1&i=p77530317141), indicating a mass wave of euphoria and a lack of hedges. \n\nAfter seeing all of this, it is clear to me that this is a retail driven bubble and not driven by the Fed after April. Where is retail getting the money for this? The answer lies in the [savings rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PSAVERT). According to the Fed, the savings rate \u201cis calculated as the ratio of personal saving to DPI. Personal saving is equal to personal income less personal outlays and personal taxes; it may generally be viewed as the portion of personal income that is used either to provide funds to capital markets or to invest in real assets such as residences.\u201d As you can see in the graph, the savings rate is now significantly higher than it has ever been before, coming in at 33%. This means that consumers are not spending money, they are saving or investing it. Consumers are also paying down [credit card debt](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TOTALSL) at much higher rates than anticipated. In the month of April, consumer credit had the [largest decrease since tracking began in 1968](https://eyeonhousing.org/2020/06/april-consumer-credit-indicates-recovery-challenges/). Remember the data in this paragraph, I\u2019m going to refer to it later in regards to deflation.\n\n**Effects of Quantitative Easing**\n\nBefore talking more about the bubble, I am going to outline some data that shows the impact of QE on our economy since 2008 up until now.\n\nThe main effect of low interest rates along with quantitative easing is an increase in the money supply. You can see that increase [here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2). Typically throughout history, an expansion in the money supply has lead to an increase in the inflation rate. That [has not happened](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FPCPITOTLZGUSA), the Fed has struggled to hit the target inflation rate since the crisis. With such an increase in the money supply, hyperinflation is stopped by the velocity at which the money moves. In 2006, Ben Bernanke noticed this phenomenon, [stating](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/10/business/worldbusiness/10iht-fed.3490493.html), \u201cthe empirical relationship between money growth and variables such as inflation and nominal output growth has continued to be unstable.\u201d A recent [research paper](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ecolet/v182y2019icp23-25.html) has also found a significant positive correlation between wealth inequality and monetary growth.\n\nVelocity of money is defined by the Fed as: \u201cthe frequency at which one unit of currency is used to purchase domestically- produced goods and services within a given time period. In other words, it is the number of times one dollar is spent to buy goods and services per unit of time. If the velocity of money is increasing, then more transactions are occurring between individuals in an economy.\u201d This velocity has been trending downward in a big way since 2008 (and before), not just in the US but everywhere. Velocity of the M2 money supply in the US broke through the previous low (tracking started in 1960) by 2012. Velocity is now [significantly lower](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V). M2 velocity includes bank reserves though, so let\u2019s take a look at the [velocity of M1](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1V) (which is physical currency and checking account deposits). [Demand deposits](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WDDNS) (checking account balances) have been exploding since 2008, with another massive jump starting in March. This means that cash is not being used and not adding to consumer prices or any economic productivity. I believe all of this to be an effect of QE and a prolonged period of low rates.\n\n**Liquidity Trap**\n\nThere has been a safe asset shortage since the advent of QE, as central banks of developed economies accumulate safe government bonds and US treasuries. This has lead to a shortage of safe assets, driving prices up and yields down artificially. Ricardo Caballero, an MIT economist, said [this](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1257/jep.31.3.29) (warning: PDF) in 2017: \u201cThe ongoing pressures driving the imbalance in safe asset markets has in recent decades helped to drive the steady decline in interest rates on safe assets. However, interest rates on these assets cannot fall much further. When the equilibrium full-employment interest rate needs to be negative, but cannot adjust sufficiently downward, then (other things equal) the equilibrating mechanism is an endogenous decline in safe asset demand through a reduction in aggregate income and wealth. That is, equilibrium is achieved through recession.\u201d At the end of 2019, the Fed owned [36% of all US treasuries](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/funding-covid-19-debt-splurge-risks-the-independence-of-major-central-banks-58610836), with that number only set to increase after their open market operations this year. of April 21st, central banks around the world have bought [5 times](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/central-banks-buy-trillion-financial-assets-g7-march-federal-reserve-2020-4-1029113160) the value of treasuries as they did in 2008.\n\nThis shortage of safe assets has pushed yields down and made it so that banks have no desire to make loans to decrease their reserves. Take a look at the [excess reserves](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/EXCSRESNS) banks have been holding. Since the 2008 crisis, excess reserves have exploded. This means that the bank is sitting on cash that they are doing nothing with. The common belief is that lending goes up as rates go down, since banks have to make more loans in order to sustain the same amount of profit. However, the data does not show that to be the case since the introduction of QE. The key thing that I have noticed in regards to excess returns and loans is that banks do not want to make loans at these low yields, possibly due to the massive unpriced systemic risk of our debt bubble popping. In Q1 2020, banks tightened their loan standards at a rate [comparable to 2008](https://www.barrons.com/articles/banks-are-tightening-lending-standards-like-it-was-2008-again-51588881348).\n\nA liquidity trap is created when low interest rates are low and consumers and institutions decide to save money instead of investing in low yielding bonds. The Fed started paying banks a [small risk free interest rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IOER) in 2008, which moves along with the Fed funds rate. I theorize that the shortage of safe assets and low interest rates has gone past the \u201creversal rate\u201d and accommodative monetary policy has become contractionary. In these uncertain times, banks would rather collect the small guaranteed risk free interest rate instead of introducing their balance sheets to any more risk, especially underpriced risk. The Fed believes that they are stimulating lending by cutting rates to 0. However, banks appear to not want to make non-guaranteed loans and instead are content to sit on their excess reserves. This means that the expansion of the monetary supply is not working as intended and that the money sitting in bank reserves is becoming contractionary. If loans aren\u2019t being made and that money isn\u2019t being spent, then that money may as well not exist in the money supply at all. According to a [Princeton economist](https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/markus/files/25b_reversalrate.pdf) (PDF), quantitative easing raises this reversal interest rate and should only be done after rate cuts are exhausted. This means that the Fed could be unknowingly contracting the money supply, even though it appears that they are massively expanding it on paper.\n\n**Deflation**\n\nDeflation occurs when institutions and individuals don\u2019t spend their money in the real economy, whether by purchasing goods/services or making loans to businesses. The Fed\u2019s [deflation probability](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/STLPPMDEF), which is the possibility that personal consumption expenditures price index change will go below 0 in the next 12 months, spiked from .001 in January to .763 in May. The [probability](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/STLPPM) that we have inflation over 2.5% over the next 12 months has crashed down to .002 as of last month. As shown in the data above, consumers aren\u2019t spending and banks are stockpiling their reserves. This is deflationary and will lead to lower prices, lower corporate earnings, and lower asset prices.\n\nAs mentioned in the data further up in the post, consumer credit dropped at a much quicker rate than expected, even with projections taking coronavirus into account. Economists expected consumer credit to fall by [$14 billion](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-consumer-credit-plummets-in-april-as-credit-card-use-tumbles-by-record-amount-2020-06-05) in April, but it fell by $68.8 billion instead. This was the largest one month drop in consumer borrowing since 1943. The core consumer price index (CPI) also [missed expectations](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/10/us-consumer-price-index-may-2020.html) of a 0-0.1% jump, instead falling by 0.1% for last month. This came after April was the largest drop (-0.4%) on record since data started in 1957.\n\nAccording to [research from the Netherlands central bank](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ecosys/v42y2018i1p45-63.html) (PDF), QE encourages risk taking by market participants and creates asset pricing bubbles. We are seeing bubbles across all asset classes thanks to the levels of debt in the economy (the stock market being an example). We even see debt bubbles too, like the $9 trillion of [corporate debt](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/21/theres-a-9-trillion-corporate-debt-bomb-bubbling-in-the-us-economy.html) (as of 2018) which help fuel these asset bubbles. The research from the Netherlands central bank also shows that asset bubbles popping are worth -4% inflation. An asset price bubble does not signal inflation either. I have picked out some quotes from the researcher that show QE might be leading to deflation:\n\n>Overall, the results suggest that the signaling value of asset prices for inflation is weak and unstable, implying that while QE is effective in boosting asset prices \u2013 one of the main transmission channels of QE \u2212 higher asset prices may not always lead to higher inflation. High asset prices may even precede a low inflation regime. For policymakers this is useful information because, based on the outcome of our models, one cannot presume that QE by definition leads to higher inflation.\n\n>If [\u2026] a surge in asset prices is not supported by real economic developments and therefore becomes unsustainable at some stage, the subsequent asset price collapse may cause a recession. \n>While central banks intend to raise inflation by purchasing government bonds to reduce bond yields, our results indicate that this policy can have the opposite effect on inflation.\n\n**Conclusion: The Fake V-Shaped Recovery**\n\nI conclude after doing this research, that there is no chance of a V-shaped recovery in the economy, despite what the market is signaling. I believe that we are about to enter into a massive deflation cycle that is being assisted inadvertently by the Fed\u2019s policy of QE and the near 0% interest rates. Consumer credit is contracting and banks are stashing extra reserves, meaning that the real money supply is contracting. Default risk on commercial mortgage backed securities, corporate bonds (thanks to lower earnings), and other forms of debt will continue to rise as the economic effects of coronavirus and monetary policy undertaken by the Fed continue to be revealed. Defaults will rise even more if we get prolonged and sustained deflation as the weight of our debt crushes our financial system. I believe that, due to the historically high levels of retail activity in the market, it will crash soon as well. The wealth inequality effect of QE (which Powell denies the existence of) will make it increasingly harder for the economy to recover.\n\nAll of these things will feed off of each other as we get further into a deflationary cycle. It will be very difficult, if not impossible, for the Fed to get out of this crisis when we get into it. Deflation is rare historically and makes monetary policy ineffective, it is a central bank\u2019s worst nightmare. Deflation will dry up economic activity and cause us to go into a depression which will be difficult to get out of.\n\n**tl;dr**: Powell thinks he is injecting money into the economy but it really isn\u2019t going anywhere, the stock market is in a bubble that will pop very soon, corporate bond and CMBS default rates will increase over the coming year, deflation will make debt a heavier burden and cash more valuable, the Fed is powerless to stop it. Our economy enters a deflationary cycle that will be hard to get out of, until the bank reserves find their way into the real economy.\n\nI\u2019ve spent a very long time researching this stuff but I am not an expert in economics or monetary policy, just another idiot on WSB. I look forward to seeing any discussion or disagreement with the ideas that I have discussed.", "created_utc": 1591880252.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h0ytcy/the_liquidity_trap_how_qe_and_low_rates_might_be/", "is_self": true}
