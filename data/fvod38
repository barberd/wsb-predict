Projected deaths at least 200k. Stimulus bill is being passed to soften the blow to...\u201d \n\nThe nightly news illuminates a dimly lit studio apartment. Richard Glover, a closeted furry enthusiast stares on, fixated upon his 9 inch tube television. \u201cThe end of the world as we know it. How can nobody see it but me?\u201d He opens Robinhood on his refurbished Nokia knockoff. SPY puts: -87%. \u201cSoon.\u201d, he mutters. \u201cJ Pow can\u2019t keep his magic money machine running forever.\u201d 2 weeks have pasted since the locked down was instated and Dick was getting restless. He occupied himself whittling away the hours on the app DrilL. Richards\u2019 cock craving, his penile passion, was becoming irresistible as the days lingered on. His phone viberated, \u201cMeet me behind the Arby\u2019s for a good time.\u201d He was torn. He had sunk every penny of his life savings into believing the total collapse of the global economy was imminent. He had sold his grandmothers cane, and emptied his anime trap waifu body pillow fund into his SPY put monthlies. The virus was here and was about to fuck us, but Dick craved a different type of fornication. His phone vibrated again, \u201cI\u2019ll let you be on the bottom ;).\u201d He pondered for a second, \u201cMaybe just this one time.\u201d He grabbed the keys to his 1993 Honda Civic and headed for the door.\n\n2 WEEKS LATER\n\nThe walls had a sickly egg shell white color. A shade befitting of the clientele. A robotic heart beat added to the oppressive ambiance of the room. Richard had many mistakes, but few that he had the wherewithal to regret. He knew he\u2019d beat this plague; the doctor was to come around any minute and give him the good news. Despite his shortness of breath, watching the market put the wind back in his sails. The market had been taking a hit recently, and his SPY 230p 4/17 was almost ITM. He fantasized about all the sweet, sweet tendies. The yachts. The mansions. Models, blow, and fast cars. He was only up $23 on his puts, but he knew it was coming. SPY 232. Time 3:45pm. A drill was coming EOD this time. He was sure of it.\n\nA doctor entered his room in full hazmat attire. Doctor Chad Bullard. Even through all the coverings, Richard could tell the docs\u2019 furrowed brow was not a good sign. \u201cMr. Glover, I have some unfortunate news to share with you about your medical situation.\u201d Shock had gripped Dick. \u201cOutlook dire.\u201d Chad continued to drone on, but Richards thoughts raced. At least he would sell his puts, and for once in his life, he\u2019d see his portfolio in the green. He glanced down at his laptop. SPY 270. Time 4:05pm. Portfolio -97%. The incessant robotic beeping came to an abrupt halt. Dick had fallen back in his bed, and just one sound carried throughout the room.\n\n\u201cGUUUUUUUUUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH...\u201d\n\n(\u201cAuthors\u201d note for actual position: SPY 200p 5/15)", "created_utc": 1586131574.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fvod38/pandemic_puts_and_punishment_the_ballad_of_gay/", "is_self": true}
