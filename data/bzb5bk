You are invested in a company that sells fake meat patties that don't taste good (subjective, but most would agree they are nothing special), are more expensive than regular meat, not any healthier than regular meat and in some is much more toxic for your body ([https://ancestral-nutrition.com/beyond-meat-is-beyond-unhealthy/](https://ancestral-nutrition.com/beyond-meat-is-beyond-unhealthy/)), and had $40 million in revenue last quarter (negative earnings as well). This thing should have a $4 billion market cap max given its current fundamentals, not $10 billion. Y'all like \"well TLRY went up to $300 and went parabolic for 6 days so that means we have more gains to grab!\" Stfu! History does not repeat itself, it rhymes. Don't be the fool that stands there with a 50% loss a month from now after buying today. Volume has been 3x float, so the HFT momentum firms pushed this shit up and will soon push this shit where it belongs. Also the short squeeze everyone claims hasn't happened probably has. 3x float volume is an f ton to trade on one day. They love taking advantage of y'all robinhood traders sitting in your PJ's at home buying into a bubble like an idiot. If you made money so far, congrats! But run while you still can because I have a feeling today will be nasty.
