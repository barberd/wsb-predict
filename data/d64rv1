{"id": "d64rv1", "title": "Daily DD- Buy SPY calls", "selftext": "So clearly the market didn't crash the last two days, but that has not limited my faith in long term puts. Expect Trump's impact to be miniscule the next two days and SPY to keep climbing because he usually saves his bullshit tweets for over the weekend so you can't unload your positions. \n\nSince we closed green today with all the bullshit going on, go ahead and mark us down for a new ATH tomorrow and potentially 303 by Friday close. Trump will probably get bored over the weekend, and tweet threatening shit to Persia on Saturday and enact more tariffs on Sunday. \n\nThat being said, I'm thinking we go calls the rest of the week and then unload right before close. Buy puts when they're cheap as fuck Friday, hold them over the weekend and let trump do what trump does best, and then make a fucking killing on Monday. \n\nThis might be the most foolproof DD I've ever had. I know there's not a lot to show for it, but I've had Trump's tweet notifications on for 4 years now. I know his tweet patterns. We're very close to another tweet storm.  \n\nTldr: buy SPY calls till Friday at noon, then switch it up on em and buy SPY puts to hold over the weekend because it's about time for a Trump storm. It's fucking foolproof.", "created_utc": 1568846098, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d64rv1/daily_dd_buy_spy_calls/", "is_self": true}
