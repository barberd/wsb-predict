Seems to be something people have been asking them to release for a while now. It\u2019s expensive but Peloton are clearly targeting the premium market, just as they were with the bike\n\nThoughtisms?", "created_utc": 1582167987, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6mikp/peloton_interactive_incoming_tendies/", "is_self": true}
