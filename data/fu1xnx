At first I was scared, but he hushed my fears with his advice on the market.\n\nHe has guided me through the past 2 years of trading, and my portfolio is up 50000%.\n\nOn Dec 20, 2018 he told me to buy as many calls for SMG 110 expiry 1st September 2019. I thought he was fucking mad, but he black mailed me by threatening to eat my frontal cortex in my sleep, and I'd wake up severely more autistic. I took out a loan and severely leveraged far out of my risk tolerance, and waited. He spoke to me everyday, told me to put more money into the calls, more soil in my mouth, more calls, more soil, more calls, more soil. I fell into an induced state only waking to buy more calls and to eat more soil.\n\nLow and behold, late August I wake up from a fever dream about compost and my calls paid off. I was a millionaire in less than 1 year. I from then on have given full trust into my brain worm. We have been making short and long term plays all over the market, and with the corona epidemic (which my brain worm predicted in 2018) we have severely exploded our portfolio further.\n\nI could live off my portfolio for the rest of my life, and have been considering pulling out and getting the worm removed. I heard him talking about us moving to the Dirtworld while he was asleep, and I'm fearful he will turn me into a vegetable if I stop trading.\n\nWhat are my best options? Do you think worm poison could potentially remove him? I love making money but I think I'm content with my tendies. Should I see a doctor about removing the worm? Im seriously torn up what to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, brain worm said ALL IN Global X Fertilizers/Potash ETF ", "created_utc": 1585889151.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fu1xnx/should_i_keep_listening_to_the_worm_that_lives/", "is_self": true}
