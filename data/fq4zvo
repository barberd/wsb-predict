I still don't get 90% of wtf is going on in regards to trading/options but I'm slowly getting there. This week I broke even and over the last 2 days, I've gone up 11k. I don't trust most of the DD here but the posts are hilarious none the less. For the solid DD that I do come across here, thank you. \n\nAnd just FYI, I work in healthcare in a major hospital in Southern California. For anyone doubting the turmoil the beer virus is causing, don't. My hospital is well equipped, well funded, and well staffed and it's fucking crazy. For less equipped hospitals, it's probably worse.
