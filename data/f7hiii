Berkshire didnt even drop this selloff and even in a recovery this might tank because why would you pay double for somebody holding Apple, Coca Cola and fucking Goldman for you. On top i dont like Buffet because he acts fake and gay. I hope he fatfingered in some bullshit positions which may come out tomorrow(quartely letter send to shareholders.) \n\n  \nFurthermore i bought some monthly TSM calls 60 strike. With NVIDIA and AMD mooning, TSM making their chips has to catch up.\n\n  \nLong Big Pharma because of Coronavirus Speculation bought GILD, GSK, und Johnson &amp; Johnson (yes all those didnt even dip today). My reasoning is that  these world ruling devil worshippers that somehow rigged the system so a fucking pill costs 60k for insurance companies which is only 100 dollar in production, they must now what they are doing, if somebody can profit from people suffering and dying they are it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven if Coronavirus is fake, those can moon on speculation. In case you who are reading this is rich, powerfull demon blessed, please consider pming me so i can become your apprentice. If you are Buffet please explain why you dont act like you have a pair, still have the same wife, drive in a old car and life in some bullshit house instead of castle. Sounds fake to me.   \n\n\nTd:lr  \n\nSPY calls 350 4/17  \nQQQ calls 250 4/17,   \nBrk.b puts 225 3/06 and 220 02/28,   \nTSM 60 3/20, \n\nBig Pharma:   \nGSK c 45 05/15 45, JNJ c 160 04/17, GILD c 75 05/15", "created_utc": 1582318498, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7hiii/how_i_safely_play_the_dip/", "is_self": true}
