{"id": "fnu0xz", "title": "Fidelity Investments- you all should know", "selftext": "I am sure some of you have accounts at Fidelity. I work at Fidelity in Westlake, TX. March 13th all associates were ordered to work from home. Only certain associates have been allowed to, due to \"system limitations.\" Today we had two people test positive for Covid-19, and were told nothing is going to change, we need to continue to not worry because a janitor wipes down our desk in the evening now. I over heard someone on my team went to management today to inform them that they had been potentially exposed to the virus over the weekend, they were told they need to stay at work, or can go home without pay. All associates are set up to work from home, but the company will not let us. Multiple people have tried calling HR, it goes no where. Now that we have had two positive cases, and all been exposed we are turning to the public for help. Please, pull your money from Fidelity, call in and tell them why. This now going to start costing people's lives, and I don't think they care. Please help us.", "created_utc": 1585004655.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnu0xz/fidelity_investments_you_all_should_know/", "is_self": true}
