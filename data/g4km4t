{"id": "g4km4t", "title": "GM and the dumbass Fed", "selftext": "Hello fellow autists, I come to you from the Coronavirus stricken country of the United States, where Mr. Pump and Jpow lead our great nation.\n\n\nI was doing some DD on this lovely evening after watching \u201cThe Big Short\u201d for about the 5th time. I was inspired by the Mortgage Based Securities bailout of the Financial Crisis and was trying to find something that had not been touched by the Fed\u2019s outstretched arms. \n\nI happened upon the auto market. Yes, one might say, \u201cbut sir papa Powell already issued asset backed securities in the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF).\u201d I would say you are quite right, but what about the upcoming demand for future vehicles.  Sure airlines, hotels and cruise lines will have a hard time getting demand back, but what about the purchase or lease of a car? That is a major purchase that I don\u2019t think many autists are willing to acquire in the foreseeable future. \n\nWith that, I did some research and found out that GM Financial revenue is about 3% of revenue for GM which I know doesn\u2019t sound like much but it\u2019s about 4 billion in total revenue. So, I thought if people lease less cars it\u2019s going to hurt GM\u2019s bottom line, right? And worst comes to worst demand will surely decrease for direct selling of cars so GM will be hurt. \n\nBut then I remembered about my King in DC, Jerome H. Powell. He told me one time that stonks only go up and that he will print ungodly amounts of money to make sure that happens. \n\n\nI have come to the conclusion like many autists that it is an univestable US equity market and that the best move is to get out now. But I will continue to buy my $SPY 9/30 275p and kill myself, but what\u2019s an autist to do?", "created_utc": 1587349968.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4km4t/gm_and_the_dumbass_fed/", "is_self": true}
