{"id": "bwc00t", "title": "Going Long Cardboard Boxes", "selftext": "On May 8th, I wrote a post saying I was buying Aug $100 calls on BYND. Later that day, u/Dotald_Trump called me out in a post saying that the WSB Prophecy Strikes Again. I  don't mind the debate, HOWEVER: in his post's comments, he made the mistake of saying: **\"If that shit hits $100 and stays above it I'll actually eat a whole cardboard box\".** When I asked him how long it needs to stay over $100, he answered \"let's say a week\". So here we are. BYND first broke $100 on Friday, May 31st. If it stays above $100 until Friday, June 7th, I fully expect a video to be posted of this guy/girl eating a cardboard box. It doesn't have to be a big one. But at least a box big enough to fit a 6-pack of Beyond Burgers. Since he lives in France, I bet the boxes they have are super environmentally friendly and probably delicious. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFull Post Link: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bm9ojk/the\\_wsb\\_prophecy\\_strikes\\_again/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bm9ojk/the_wsb_prophecy_strikes_again/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)\n\nCardboard Box Quote Link: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bm9ojk/the\\_wsb\\_prophecy\\_strikes\\_again/emuwdvu?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bm9ojk/the_wsb_prophecy_strikes_again/emuwdvu?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf he loses the bet and wants to substitute eating a cardboard box for donating $500 to the National Fragile X Foundation, I will allow it provided we see a proof of donation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso- for some extra Due Diligence: Interactive Brokers, Fidelity, and Schwab have 0 shares of BYND to lend out. Borrow rates are now 90-150% across the street. This is up from 87-93% at the end of last week (that I was able to find). Not sure on % of float that is short at the moment but last week it was 51%.", "created_utc": 1559575983, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bwc00t/going_long_cardboard_boxes/", "is_self": true}
