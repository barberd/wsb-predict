Passengers reported on Twitter that other cruise ships were allowed to disembark.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[News out right now from Turks and Caicos](http://magneticmediatv.com/2020/03/75378/) government saying:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. They refused ship's request to disembark because it had sick people on it (ship was required to submit paperwork before docking, as per protocols)\n2. They refused ship's request to get 2 passengers medivac'd out via Grand Turk island.\n\n... so not only are those people sick. They are so sick that they need immediate attention? Fuck! Would hate to be on that boat. CCL could seriously be going bankrupt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ship #1 - Carnival's Diamond Princess** \\- was off the coast of Japan. All passengers disembarked on 2/27/2020.

Keeping an eye on these.*\n\n\\*Edit, thanks to u/usupsupman1001 for this added DD.\n\n\\*\\*Edit 2, another one, news breaking just before 4pm EST. Fuck....\n\n\\*\\*\\*Edit 3, 4:25pm on 3/7 - going to use this as a place to update while I do a bit of research myself (since news sucks and will just copy this post sometime later). Anyways... **for ship #3, Grand Turk was the FIRST stop. The ship seems to be headed \"home\" back to Miami, FL (source:** [**cruisemapper.com**](https://cruisemapper.com)**, cannot direct link the route). Not a good sign**. Also using this to see which cruise ships are next possible targets (coming home and/or off-track), to see if I can figure out some insight into how deep this goes. Should I roll over my puts or cash this fucker out soon?\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*Edit, 12pm EST on 3/8 - seems like mulitple ships are delayed. One is CONFIRMED not disembarking because crew needs to be tested. They were on another infected ship before this trip. At this point, I believe #1- Carnival's problems are going to blow open very soon and all ships will be cancelled and #2, I should get a job in journalism.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*Edit, 8:30pm EST on 3/8 - State department has issued a warning NOT TO GO ON A CRUISE.  [https://twitter.com/TravelGov/status/1236739608794275846](https://twitter.com/TravelGov/status/1236739608794275846) \n\nCCL 3/13 $25P if it opens anywhere above it. You're probably too late. This bitch could gap down -20%. When your company's name is being blased out by President of USA and VP, about bad things... and you're (possibly) responsible for killing people, then the business is essentially dead.", "created_utc": 1583595458.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fewp8v/another_carnival_cruise_in_caribbean_has_issues/", "is_self": true}
