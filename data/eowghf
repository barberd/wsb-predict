{"id": "eowghf", "title": "TESLA : No Robots In Factory := Chapter 11 Within 5 years.", "selftext": "Everyone hypes TESLA without doing a fundamental analysis of its business model.\n\nMusk argued that TESLA would be BIGLY profitable because of factory automation.  But that failed miserably and it employs human labour.  Human labour that has been slow to ramp up to 100K production.   The point is that TESLA is not hyper scalable as in the original business plan because of the lack of automation.  This can be observed in the financial statement, where TESLA, in profitable quarters only makes 150M in earnings.  Not enough to pay off it 11B in long term liability or fund greater expansion.\n\nThe business model is flawed at this debt level.  TESLA would have been great if it had solved the factory automation problem, but it became too cash strapped, and now it's earning just enough to pause the pessimism, but that pessimism will return once people realize that what TSLA is earning now or scaled is not enough to pay off all the bad debt.\n\nTESA needs Chapter 11 to restructure.  When it comes out leaner and can deploy capital at automation, will it be worth its 100B market cap.  Until then, it's going to 0 in 5 years.", "created_utc": 1579057832, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eowghf/tesla_no_robots_in_factory_chapter_11_within_5/", "is_self": true}
