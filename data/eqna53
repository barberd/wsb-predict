{"id": "eqna53", "title": "Noob Seeking Help", "selftext": "I'm the definition of a noob that has never traded an option before and want to start by using the Robinhood app. My budget is around $200 and I'm trying to flip it into $420 tendies money.\n\nLooking at selling puts for ACB because broke af. RobinHood shows that on 02/07 there's a $2 put with $0.17 premium (in red) or a $1.5 put with $0.04 premium (in green). Does the color of the premium mean you either pay that amount or get paid (red v green?). So would I have to pay $0.17 to lock in the option to buy shares @ $2? \n\nI want to do cash covered puts so does that mean if I chose the $2 one I would need exactly $200 to cover it if I got assigned? Would it be better to save up to $300 and then do two $1.50 contracts?
