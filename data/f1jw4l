Not any kind of edge, the holy grail edge, why do I say it\u2019s holy grail kind? Because in trading there\u2019s only 3 things that matters, entry, exist, and size. And it\u2019s pretty damn precise. But I\u2019m not gonna get further into this right now. \n\u2022Moral of the story, I\u2019m gonna break one of the rules that all professional traders will advise against, and that is over leverage, I am going to take out 100k in credit card loans, and take it as a challenge to turn it into 200k over the course of 2020. Let me know if you guys want me to update this journey. And I\u2019ll keep it posted.
