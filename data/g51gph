USO? odd, shit goes way the fuck up.\n\nLOD on both futures chart is big dick red candle after circled candles. USO LOD actually first candle AH with huge volume. You can see I picassoed in big dick red candles where they should have been on USO chart and would have lined up with AH LOD.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what happened?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT-\n\nWould like to add at the time of the circled candles level II was nuts 4x bid to ask, it was a wall and it just walked up. Also, USO is selling additional shares... like some had been taken out of circulation.\n\nI think the Fed bought the dip boys.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ifuv8tje1u41.jpg?width=1056&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8c68f6642442bd32547051dc870ae9e8e30c1a0d", "created_utc": 1587417310.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g51gph/uso_decouples_from_futures_pricing/", "is_self": true}
