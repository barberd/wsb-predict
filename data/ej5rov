Yield curve inversion, GDP growth slowing down, manufacturing firms growth slowed down to the lowest it\u2019s been in 10 fucking years back in august. Lastly, Low confidence in US government abroad. \n\nSo my plan is take all the capital Gains from this year growth and by the end of January invest only in commodities and foreign stocks. \n\nBy foreign I mean \u201cChina\u201d.  Chinese insurance companies, Chinese health care companies, Chinese electric cars, Chinese fucking noodles if I can invest in them. \n\nI read \u201cthe little red book\u201d Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung and I have seen the light \ud83d\udca1. \n\nLong live the communist party bring them tendies here boi.\n\n\nEdit: holla if you lost money on calls today. Invest in \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3 and stop playing this yo-yo game. You made some money yesterday and lost it all today.", "created_utc": 1578005356, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ej5rov/us_economy_heading_for_a_recession_im_investing/", "is_self": true}
