I was a bit dumbfounded and some genius came with the meme that robinhood jobless people were driving that price up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlthough skeptical that it was the case, it did leave me wondering whether idiots were in fact driving the price up. Then it reached the news and the story was in fact that idiots were driving the price up, and HTZ has since plummeted by 60%. Some people will say its because NYSE announced delisting, but delisting almost always happens from NYSE in a bankruptcy, they usually don't meet the requirements to stay listed when going through a bankruptcy, so it should've been expected.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo idiots drove the price up, and then being called out became sentient and drove the price back down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPretty insane time we live in, the accessibility of brokerage and the accessibility of information has created an industry where it is stritcly impossible to tie fundamentals back to value over the short term, but creates incredible opportunity over the long terms.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI suspect this will create even larger gaps between very rich, and the rest, since we do not have the same opportunities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCrazy times.", "created_utc": 1591895241.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h13cn1/retards_car_rentals_and_bankruptcy/", "is_self": true}
