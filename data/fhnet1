Average age of a truck driver in the USA? 55. More than 50% of truck drivers are obese. Many have been smoking for years. Many travel all over the country and are exposed to a ton of different people.\n\nWith or without quarantine, businesses are going to be shutting down because a lot of drivers are going to get very sick. The supply chain issues only grow. We ain't seen nothing yet. \n\nFedex, UPS, and XPO are a few examples that have already been hit that things will get worse for. Even with quarantine I think it might be too little too late. It was already a huge industry issue finding new drivers, it isn't going to get better when a bunch of them die and there is absolutely nobody waiting to replace them.  \n\nTLDR things get worse.", "created_utc": 1584046421.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhnet1/quick_facts_for_the_transportation_industry/", "is_self": true}
