Here's why:\n\n* SHOP makes a chunk of their revenue on these payment processing\n* Previously, SHOP would refund theirs fees for refunded sales.   They will no longer be doing so.\n* Refunds / Returns are SIGNIFICANT in several industries the gravitate towards shopify, especially fashion/apparel where they are usually between 20-40% of gross sales.\n\nI read this and see an immediate, unexpected increase in revenue (pending no merchant revolt) that drops straight to the bottom line since there are zero costs associated with it.\n\n[A quick Googling reveals some high level stats on the distribution of companies on Shopify.](https://hostingtribunal.com/blog/shopify-statistics/#content-16)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Industry|Number of Companies|\n|:-|:-|\n|Retail|12534|\n|Apparel &amp; Fashion|6772|\n|Wholesale|3999|\n|Restaurants|2853|\n|Consumer Goods|2521|\n|Health, Wellness and Fitness|2285|\n|Food &amp; Beverages|1873|\n|Computer Software|1180|\n|Furniture|1161|\n|Design|1100|\n\nIf I were not invested fully in PRPL, I would probably math out an estimate of net revenue increase from this change in their policy and how it might effect stock price, but I won't.\n\n**tl;dr**  Shopify is going to screw over their merchants with fees over refunds, which could drive immediate, unexpected double digit growth to their top line, which in turn would drive even greater growth to their bottom line.   ***If you blindly bet***, then **bet calls** this ER.   If you math, then share with everyone else.  It's Friday.  I'm not mathing this.\n\nI'm neither long nor short SHOP.", "created_utc": 1581112693, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f0ho2x/shop_dd/", "is_self": true}
