The red start really drew down everything that I was tracking as an opening play, and even TWLO couldn't bail me out today - went in and out pretty damn quickly this morning. So I sat and waited for a good play - and nothing really seemed like a good deal - almost went in on MT and X but decided against it.\n\nAnd then the financials started to run up! Jumped in for a quick buck on BAC, JPM, and WFC - made some quick money there! Which was great. Tried to do the same thing with MS - but by then the financials were skipping town - so I scalped a quick $10 and closed out the position. Missed the TWLO morning moon because of this... sad day :(\n\nSpent the rest of the day looking for a good play - and thought I'd found one EOD with LRCX - but I got in just a TAD too late on its runup, and I got screwed on the spread when she started to flatten out EOD. Ended up hitting my stop pretty quickly and dumped for a loss. While she ended up going up further EOD - gotta remind myself that its just as likely that she would have fallen further. Glad I got out only lost $77. AND SHE CONTINUES IN AFTER HOURS. GUH.\n\nThe jump in overall value today is because another $500 was available for me to trade today! The final $500 is coming in hopefully tomorrow? Maybe on Monday - gotta wait for it too clear.\n\n* I learned the patience lesson initially today! But I've gotta work on that one since another company I was watching for EOD - WIX - decided to moon instead of LRCX. Best to take that one to the bank.\n* Trailing stops worked pretty well today! Definitely contained my losses on a couple things.\n* Even though I already know this - I've gotta be better about watching the spread on the options I buy, part of the reason I got fucked on LRCX was that the spread was over $0.50 - so fuck me.\n\n**The Plan:**\n\n1. Get a TDA cash account and fund with $2000\n2. Play intra-day swing and momentum trades\n3. Cut losses early and often - wins will accumulate over losses.\n4. Take profits Regularly\n   1. Account Balance $4000 - take $2000 to cover initial investment\n   2. Account Balance $14328 - take $12328 to cover cash losses\n   3. Account balance of $6057.37 - take $4057.37 to cover equity losses\n\n**Position History:**\n\nDay 4: 5/14 +9.96% ($1968.86 - $2165.08)\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|TWLO 5/22 200c|\\-$26|1|$425|$399|\n|BAC 5/15 21C|\\+$63|3|$41|$62|\n|GS 5/15 172.5C|\\+$46|2|$183|$206|\n|JPM 5/15 87C|\\+$135|5|$68|$95|\n|LCRX 5/15 270C|\\-$77|1|$342|$265|\n|MS 5/15 37.5C|\\+$10|5|$44|$46|\n|WFC 5/15 24C|\\+$67|3|$41|$63.5|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDay 3: 5/13 +8.35% - $1356.57 - $1469.84\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|CODX 6/19 20C|\\-$22|1|$277|$255|\n|TWLO 5/22 200C|\\+$174|1|$469|$643|\n|DDOG 5/15 70C|\\+$45|1|$200|$245|\n|NVDA 5/15 335C|\\-$39|1|$213|$174|\n|ZM 5/15 180C|\\-$39|1|$180|$141|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDay 2: 5/12 +29.53% - $1046.34 - $1356.57\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|CRM 6/19 200C|\\+2|1|$263|$265|\n|EGHT 6/19 20C|\\+59|1|$191|$250|\n|TWLO 5/29 205C|\\+30|1|$370|$400|\n|VTIQ 5/15 30C|\\+224|2|$103|$215|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDay 1: 5/11 +5% - $1000.89 - $1046.34\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|DDOG 5/15 55c|\\+54|1|$380|$434|\n|CSCO 5/15 44.5c|\\-16|2|$214|$198|\n|CHWY 5/15 39.5c|\\+12|1|$134|$146|\n\nFAQ:\n\n* Why do I have so many day trades with such a small account?\n   * Cash accounts aren't subject to PDT restrictions - instead what happens is that you can only spend up to the amount of cash you have in a day.For Example - at open today I have $1050 in cash - meaning I could buy up to $1050 in option positions for the day. As long as I sell whatever positions I have by market close - that $1050 plus whatever gains I made during the day are available as cash in my account by market open tomorrow. It does end up limiting the number of positions I can take in a day because I only have so much cash - but it allows me to easily prevent losses by having a tight stop loss - and it allows me to take gains when my positions do well.\n   * Technical Side:It does take time for the cash to \"settle\", ie. have the transaction be processed. For stocks that is T+2 - meaning your cash is available two days after you close the position. However for options that is only T+1 - meaning the cash is available back in your account the day after you sell the position.\n* What Broker am I using?\n   * TD Ameritrade and their ThinkOrSwim platform. You pay $1.10 for every round-trip contract, but it is definitely worth it - if only to be able to set a proper trailing stop.\n   * TD Ameritrade cash accounts also let you purchase options - which is not something thats possible with RH.\n* Please take my advice with a grain of salt - this is all coming from a guy who lost over $15,000 in the past two months - so pleaseee treat my advice with the skepticism it deserves.
