Example:\n\nWith Christian Bale stuttering in the background, I analyze $GLD on Stonk Charts. From April to September, i continually doubled down on an iron condor in gold futures. It started innocently with a solid iron condor, 20 handles wide, 30% CR based on the width of the spread. Nice.\n\nThen, in June, gold skyrockets as \"trader's panic on trade talks\". Oh shit, I think. 21 DTE, better roll out. Fuck, can't do it for a net CR? No time, skip the lube; going in dry. What was once 1 contract, was 2, then 5, then ultimately 11.\n\nAs Mark Baum respond's to a guy who says he's a commodity trader \"good luck with that..\" I get fired up. Fuck it, $20 wide? $40. $50. $100. Glass eye bobbing intensifies.\n\nCome September, I'm popping Tums like they're percocets. Gold is $1,550, my short calls are at a 99 delta, fuck. No capital left. Do I close out and book a loss of $30k USD, or double down and dip into my PLOC? interest on loans in Canada 5% while I can get 100% tendies in futures. Decide no. I like my house.\n\nI decide to close out. I don't have the \"i'd like to close out my position\" like Burry, it was not a happy ending.\n\nI went full retard on this trade. and, of course as every WSB autist knows, as soon as you close out a massive loser, the trade (would have) goes your way. Mad, sell naked strangle in /CL. Iran bombs Saudia Arabia. RIP.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, here's Wonderwall.
