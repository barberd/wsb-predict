{"id": "bdui5f", "title": "Dropshopping is dead", "selftext": "$SHOP has gone up over the past year and almost doubled up since the drop of Dec 2018.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn a daily trading, the stock has gone parabolic and it is currently day 9 on the daily candles which might close with a doji. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is a general rule where if a stock holds at a ATH in this case $200 it will hit the $220 mark. (Probably due to algos in modern day)\n\nGreatly overextended, at the upper level of bollingers, I think $SHOP will retrace.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMarket Theory:\n\nPeople will protect their gains and take profit as we hit the top again.\n\n1 in 100 startups successfully launch, drop shipping seems like a super saturated market. With margins thinning due to inflation, there will be less e-comm startups. \n\nThe E-comm world is changing, Brand building &lt; Getting sales, Amazon is so convenient with fulfillment centers, it will cost less to pay for the order fulfillment service than to implement it.\n\nPostage rates have gone up! We are no longer subsidizing Chinese postage.\n\nTrading across NA (US and Canada), more access, more volume for the gains more volume for the drop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMarket Catalysts:\n\nEarnings date on: April 30th. Current EPS Estimate at: (0.35)\n\nSPYs topping out, tech stocks have gone flat trading +/- 1% daily. (OI says after hitting 293 (THIS WEEK?) SPY due for a correction.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPosition:\n\n8 contracts $197.5P , 5/3.  Playing this earnings to the end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTargets:\n\n1st target $202\n\n2nd target $194\n\n3rd target $186", "created_utc": 1555424493, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bdui5f/dropshopping_is_dead/", "is_self": true}
