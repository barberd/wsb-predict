They will start asking questions like \"do the American people feel safe in the hands of CEOs that don't even give their employees health benefits?\" Here what this Boston doctor has to say. Freakouts. Tidal waves of bad news and outlooks. More emotional spam of Wuhan refugees and the quarentined. It will be a fucking atomic bomb of bad press now that bread and circuses are canceled. Their may even be a few riots that spring up Saturday and Sunday. All events are being cancelled. Quartined zones have grown to countries. Work from home applies to maybe 12% of employed workforce (someone correct me). Come Monday, the market will realize that this bull trap was just the warm hug they needed to rise the stock and \"sell high\". Retards. If you have calls, sell them. If you have puts, adamantium hands.  I have Spy 245p 3/20. This is textbook shit. Supply chains are not coming back. It's not even projected just propagandized.\n\nEdit: added my stake.", "created_utc": 1584146131.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fia087/heres_what_happens_next/", "is_self": true}
