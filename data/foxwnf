It says that people who make more than 99k in 2018 will not receive any money. However, it also says that people without income are eligible so how does this work? Is there a way to communicate to the IRS that one is currently not receiving any income?", "created_utc": 1585169201.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/foxwnf/for_the_stimulus_personal_checks_what_happens_to/", "is_self": true}
