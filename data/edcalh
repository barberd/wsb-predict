I'm interested in marijuana stocks such as ACB or CGC in regards to the federal decriminalization that could happen on the 31st. \nAlso want to put money in some less risky moderate return stocks to even out the portfolio such as XEL, BSX, JNJ...\nI realize that $1000 is not that much and just want to see some growth and gain exposure to the practice of trading. \nThanks for any advice!
