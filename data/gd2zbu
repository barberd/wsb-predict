I averaged into SPY puts 4/21-4/23 as we rose from 272 up to 283. I expected the channel to break downward. It didn't. I put $4000 into this play. Last Monday I was down over $1700. Last Wednesday saw the current max loss, down $2300. Worse than the money, there was the reality that when I decided to put money into this play, I candidly didn't see a breakout to the positive, and being wrong is not my favorite.\n\nWhen a play breaks down, the important thing is to reassess. I don't believe in diamond hands, in life the only value in looking back is to learn from the past before turning forward and making the best of what sits in front of you.\n\nEach day is a coin flip. I called it wrong. When we broke channel, I had to re-evaluate. When I set the play in motion, it was primarily due to the channel compounding with critical earnings announcements and the FED meeting. What kept me in the play was the lack of news that changed my macro vibe, and the back of the week Amazon earnings call.\n\n# Still Holding, Still Down\n\nThings went to crap, but we tested 292+, got a giant red candle as we closed 4/29, set a high of 296+ after hours, before crashing into our 4/30 open. The bears are driving this week, but it's unclear to me how much momentum they have.\n\nEarnings calls are still bullish. Q1 wasn't great. Q2 who cares priced in. Q3 ... 'murica! I believe that narrative a total fallacy. Q3 will not turn the way the market hoped, neither will Q4, nor 2021 for that matter. Yet, all that matters for this play is right now. The market is forward looking, and there isn't a ton of bull news to counter all the bear straw being chucked on our friendly camel. But .. I don't know that I believe this downtrend is a capitulation by bulls, I am extremely worried that there's another test in the 285-295 range coming. Time to chew some straw.\n\n# Nom, Nom, Straw\n\n* Google - Headcount reduction, cap-ex reduction (office build out pull back), mid-teens decline for Q2, YouTube high single digit decline end of march.

It will spook the market hard. This country is over being locked down, signs are everywhere, people have had enough and fear is fading. The bar for risk has trended bull. We're BFF's with Sweden. More people will die because of it, but don't confuse yourself into thinking the market **has** to care. It doesn't, and it might not, or it might, flip a coin.\n\n# Sell the Dip? Hold for Tendies?\n\nTruth is, I'm not stupid enough to tell you I know where we're headed. We broke a key resistance point in Sunday futures. [SV has terrific volume profiles](https://twitter.com/sep_var/status/1257070583738544134?s=20) and has keyed on 2790 as the number to watch for tomorrow's open. Let's revisit last our prior channel:\n\n[Well hello again](https://preview.redd.it/qwowmbzcpnw41.png?width=1193&format=png&auto=webp&s=d52924e71474605f88f123d8f0ceaa12747e4315)\n\nThe challenge with going up when we think it'll go down is that we create solid supports as we retrace. Each support eats momentum, and I can't make up my mind for the short term on if we a) bounce off 274-277 and test upwards again or b) break the channel's support and test into the 260's.\n\nGiven my lack of confidence in short term direction, I've already started looking for hedges and plays that can help me protect myself as I watch for a need to exit. I candidly don't know exactly how I'll play this to it's end. But I can tell you the first action I'll take. To revisit where I have allocated my $4000: 14.62% allocated to 5/29 220p, 45.14% to 6/30 220p, and 40.25% to 9/18 220p.\n\nMy 5/29 position is currently down an encouraging 76.76% at market close Friday. I have very little interest in continuing to hold it, theta will burn what little is left to the ground. I want to see where futures land in the morning, then barring the unforeseen, I'll set a stop limit order to dump the position.\n\nFor now, I'm not looking to abandon the 6/30 or 9/18 positions. I may take the remaining 5/29 position if it stops out and look to average 6/30 down. With any luck, we drill until reality hits and everything prints.\n\nFor now, the coach drew a play he believed in, everyone practiced it, he called it in the game, the defense covered it perfectly, the QB scrambled towards the sideline and everyone went into scramble drill mode. What happens next? Flip a coin. Watch it all unfold, and react with intention.\n\nI'll post updates as time allows and the week progresses.", "created_utc": 1588558203.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gd2zbu/the_normie_playbook_wait_is_this_happening/", "is_self": true}
