The Flu is a gift.", "selftext": "Lets assume flu will spread more, it dies down around late spring and in summer we will be good again. Next flu season will be tough, but I am sure we have working medicine or vaccine by then. Lets say it will spread over 100 million people and 2% dies, which is 2 million. Seems realistic based on my research on pornhub.\n\nThe region East Asia, Europe and US will have the most casualties due the moderate climate, which the virus needs. So lets assume 75% of all casualties will be here. These areas are also the location of the most developed countries.\n\nWe also assume that over 75% of the people who die will be 65 years and older who would otherwise have ~15 years to live on average.\n\nWith some googling and common sense the people in these first world countries would cost society 75.000 dollar on average per year on pensions, healthcare and social security.\n\nSo lets do the math how much this virus is saving us costs to care for these boomers:\n\n2.000.000 * 0.75(first world countries) * 0.75(65+) * $75.000 =\n\n$84.375.000.000 per year or 1.265.625.000.000\u202c in the next 15 years.\n\nIt gets even better, most of the things these boomers own, goes to their kids. This Generation X, is the agegroup with the highest debt. So boomer money will be used to pay off car payments and creditcard loans. \n\nThe housing market will get an injection of free homes, pensionfunds will save billions of dollars which they will use to buy stonks.  Businesses will receive support from goverments with taxcuts and moneyinjections. You already see this in China, Hong Kong, Korea and Italy. Some business will die, but these are the boomers among business. \n\nAnd last but not least: People will get motivated to be productive again when summer arrives, summer will be more productive than average and people will be more happy because they value normal life more. \n\nThe price for all this is 1 bad quarter, some autists who nuke their RH account, a few of us couching a bit and some of you dont need to visit your grandparents anymore on sunday.\n\nI think that is a good tradeoff and as society we will learn, grow and profit from this. \n\nSo stop whining and start making your strategy how you play this, market will realize this sooner or later.", "created_utc": 1583097755, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fc0whs/this_flu_will_kill_mostly_boomers_and_older_this/", "is_self": true}
