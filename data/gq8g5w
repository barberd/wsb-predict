I said I was a shitty programmer right? Fuck, whatever.\n\nSo the only people who have this options timestep data historically charge out the ass for it. The best I could afford was hour timestep data on all options since 2004. I PAID $3400 FOR THE DATA:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Still a smarter loss than whatever plays you guys make this week](https://preview.redd.it/7pkqzf55xv051.png?width=1131&format=png&auto=webp&s=659799db835eebf8a11b0cdb5326610ccd0cacea)\n\nSo anyway, big payment, takes till friday night for the order to process, giving me two days two test my shitty new code to handle sideways and bear markets with spreads and condors and puts.
