They have continued to increase by a good amount but their numbers have certainly shot up during the last few months.\n\n\nYou can either shoot for earnings run up or earnings play right now.\n\n\nPersonally I'd go for $7 calls where theres low chance of losing a good portion of the intrinsic value while also paying only a few cents per contract in premium\n\n\nI see no way people jump the ship prior to earnings on this company. But a run up is certainly possible.\n\nPrice target maybe around 7.7-7.8 per earnings. 8.1-8.3 after maybe?\n\nEither way I think it's a low risk play especially pre earnings.\n\nI dont have DD numbers but I just dont see the argument for them doing bad right now with almost no premium.", "created_utc": 1587739387.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g79kzv/znga_calls_are_dirt_cheap_right_now/", "is_self": true}
