There are too many people who actually think that the stock isn\u2019t going to correct itself. I feel like most of them weren\u2019t around for the tech bubble of 2000. This is no different than that. Astronomical PE ratios, ridiculously unrealistic valuations, fear of missing out, and speculation that is not supported by fundamentals.  I get the realization of \u201cTesla is a tech company!\u201d Obviously it is but the price of the stock is outpacing the real performance of the company. Bubble. \n\nIf you own Tesla, congratulations. I am really happy for you. But you need to realize that you got lucky. If I were you I would pull out before you end up seeing those gains go byebye. Rule #1 of proper investing is don\u2019t be greedy. That being said good luck to you all.", "created_utc": 1580842023, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eyut8g/i_honestly_cant_wait_to_short_tsla/", "is_self": true}
