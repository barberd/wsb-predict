{"id": "fxwnpk", "title": "The Bear -> Bull flip opportunity", "selftext": "For starters I\u2019m a rainbow bear, started buying puts when SPY was @ 314, up 500% still even after holding puts, and I am very confident they will print (5/15 exp). If you think that\u2019s dumb you probably don\u2019t like money and won\u2019t want to read the rest of this. \n\nAnyways, my big play once we re-test the bottom and I sell my puts to panicking bulls here flipping sides at exactly the worst time again, is to buy calls on the top manufacturers of medications for heart disease.\n\nI have a PhD and work in the biotech industry, and I think these companies are going to see sales skyrocket in the next 5 years. \n\nThe reason for this is multifaceted. There is a great deal of evidence that people of low socioeconomic status (most people reading this) are much more likely to have heart disease and obesity. This group is also the most severely affected by the current economic problems, and will continue to be. Further, everyone is trapped in a much more sedentary lifestyle than usual for months on end. \n\nI predict this will lead to a large increase in the development of heart disease and associated health outcomes, driving up sales. The top players in this space are Sanofi, Bayer, BMS, and J and J. There may also be great opportunity with smaller early stage companies in this space, which will likely sell off to a much greater extent due to lack of pipeline/revenue and fear of bankruptcy, which is not the case for the giants. I have yet to look into that further.\n\nInterested to hear if you all have your eyes on any specifics companies in this space.\n\nSPY 210p 5/15, then SNY 60c Jan 2022 (not buying til the market drops again)", "created_utc": 1586453416.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxwnpk/the_bear_bull_flip_opportunity/", "is_self": true}
