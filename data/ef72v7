I may have been premature when i called out BA for the being the garbage fire of company it is, but now its true color is showing: RED. \n\nI dont care that they basically have an oligopoly and the costs to enter the industry are astronomical. The BA love affair is souring. I dont see how they can dig themselves out of this shithole. I know many people who are legitimately planning trips to avoiding boeing aircrafts.
