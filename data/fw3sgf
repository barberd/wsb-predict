You're confident the economy will tank, yet in your hearts you know Trump could send out a few tweets and everything is fixed for a week.\n\n As soon as people start getting their $1,200 Trump bucks, Trump is going to go around saying how saved the economy is and how everyone has money now and how great USA is and we always overcome. I wouldnt be surprised if Trump is confident enough to announce we hit the peak of beer germs and that were curving downward in cases.\n\nEveryone has $1,200. Corona cough cases trending down. Printers resupplied with fresh ink. Think of all the false confidence this will inject the market with.\n\nWhile the media is busy reporting everyone dying, Trump and JPOW are propping the market up. The real bear market will be when were nearing the end of the pandemic, and media turns full focus onto Trump and the failing economy. Until then,  \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b back in the closet.", "created_utc": 1586196772.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fw3sgf/one_trump_tweet_could_bring_spy_to_280/", "is_self": true}
