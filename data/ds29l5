I fucked up in my 20's and majored in sports medicine and retroactively attempted to fix my mistakes by going into law school and getting in debt to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars, so now I work for the state as a public defender making a cool 40,000$ a year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI represent CTN in the court of autistic law. We are suing RH for 50,000$ as well as the dismissal of CTNs unjust debt. Here is my defense:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**My client is clearly mentally unstable, as what stable person adult would gamble a borrowed 50,000 when they are already in debt. My client is clearly severely autistic, and evens goes as far as posting to the popular autism support form -** r/wallstreetbets **- after the traumatic event. To charge this man for RH's negligence would be immoral.**", "created_utc": 1572974216, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ds29l5/a_statement_from_ctns_public_defender/", "is_self": true}
