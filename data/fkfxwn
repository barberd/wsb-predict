{"id": "fkfxwn", "title": "Leveraged mREIT ETN liquidation fire sale brought to you by UBS", "selftext": "**tl;dr long $NYMT, $MFA, $EFC, $CIM, anything else that has been hit hard in the past few days from index components here: https://etracs.ubs.com/product/detail/index/ussymbol/MRRL**\n\nI might be autistic, but it looks like $MRRL and $MORL, 2x Leveraged Mortgage REIT ETNs run by UBS, are liquidating, as they are well below the $5 per share threshold for automatic acceleration, have been for more than a day, and their smaller constituents have been getting hammered the past two days with large block market sells at EOD, which implies that whoever is doing the selling is trying to get out quick and doesn't give af how much they get for what they're selling. At this point, almost all of the smaller constituents are trading significantly below their tangible book value (aka what you'd get if you sold off the tangible parts of the company).\n\nThis is also reflected in the high volume and final trades of the day on these - very large trades relative to the number of outstanding shares:\n\n- $NYMT - 2.2 million shares sold at market on Monday EOD, 2.4 million shares sold at market today EOD\n- $MFA - 1.7 million shares sold at market today EOD\n- $CIM - 655k shares sold at market today EOD\n\nUntil this selling ends, all of the smaller index components are much cheaper than they should be, since there aren't enough buyers for all the shares that UBS is selling. Buy them or buy calls on them if they're liquid enough once you think the selling is done.\n\nNow, the risk here, (aside from me being retarded and these funds not actually liquidating - it hasn't been announced yet) is that you don't know where the bottom is ie. when UBS will run out of shares to sell. Using $NYMT as an example, we can see that UBS is the fourth largest shareholder with around 9 million shares (or 2.4% of all outstanding shares) as of Dec 2019 here: https://www.nymtrust.com/stock-information/ownership-profile. Assuming those two block sales were them, and some volume during the day was also them, it looks like they should be almost done. I'd assume the same would go for the others, but I'm too lazy to check.\n\n**EDIT: This was just announced by UBS here: https://etracs.ubs.com/filedb/deliver/xuuid/l001de0c94be5b2d43fe8bd6ad6c7cb513f3/name/UBS+announces+mandatory+redemption+of+ETRACS+Monthly+Pay+2xLeveraged+Mortgage+REIT+ETN+due+October+16%2C+2042+and+ETRACS+Monthly+Pay+2xLeveraged+Mortgage+REIT+ETN+Series+B+due+October+16%2C+2042+.pdf**", "created_utc": 1584489705.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkfxwn/leveraged_mreit_etn_liquidation_fire_sale_brought/", "is_self": true}
