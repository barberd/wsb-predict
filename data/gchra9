{"id": "gchra9", "title": "The sub r/CapitalOne has been locked for almost 2 weeks, customer credit delayed, payment cancellations denied: Capital One in dire straits?", "selftext": "Capital One is getting squeezed. On top of the coronavirus depression, the oil futures they hold for clients caused them losses so great that they might need to register with CFTC. This is a relatively small part of their balance sheet though: the lion's share of their business is lending to Americans who can barely pay them the minimum payment each month while they extend them more credit. Sounds like an impending disaster.\n\nI have an auto loan with them and they sent me a letter saying that automatic payments must be cancelled more than three business days in advance, despite what I was \"inadvertently\" informed when I signed up for automatic payments on the app. That sounds desperate.\n\nOn the sub r/CapitalOne, the last few posts are from folks who are not immediately getting credit for credit card payments. I can confirm as a Capital One customer that ordinarily I receive credit immediately upon payment. This, again, sounds desperate.\n\nThe last time I posted about Capital One on this sub, several Capital One shills commented about how great the company is to work for, how allegations of their predatory lending practices are overblown etc. (\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g86bjt/capital_one_cof_is_probably_in_much_worse_shape/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\nNow, curiously, the sub r/CapitalOne is locked. I attempted to post to it from a couple usernames and was informed that \"you aren't allowed to post here.\" There hasn't been a post there for 11 days - and the last ones visible are all negative.\n\nI think Capital One is going to great lengths to shore up its balance sheet by pulling out all the stops their customers agreed to in the fine print and may be involved in locking down the sub r/CapitalOne. \n\nCapital One is a lender that will be hit hard by the coronavirus depression. Many of its customers are barely able to pay their bill - in fact this is their entire business model according to the article linked to on my previous post about Capital One.\n\nWhat's in your wallet? \n\nCOF 6/19 $47.5 P", "created_utc": 1588468022.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gchra9/the_sub_rcapitalone_has_been_locked_for_almost_2/", "is_self": true}
