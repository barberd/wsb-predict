Was looking at DAL, [AC.TO](https://AC.TO) and SAVE as the main ones to hold but I feel like AC has consistently just gone up after the initial crash. The US airlines have fluctuated quite a bit so idk if its because its the main canadian provider that people dont think it can fail? I believe that too but looking at what happened in 2008, the company can and will survive but doesnt mean that it should be trading at $20.\n\nJust hoping for another crash to buy in", "created_utc": 1588127769.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ga17qj/wow_i_cant_watch_these_airlines_and_cruise_stocks/", "is_self": true}
