{"id": "fe5zct", "title": "VXX Wins Today.. Could it implode?", "selftext": "I made a decent chunk of change today holding VXX into open. I sold around 2pm and came away with 15%.\n\nI'm currently reading the Wallstreetbets book and just passed the part where a trader lost 4.3 million on XIV back on 2/5/18, when the ETF was \"liquidated\" by the company that ran it. \n\nI'm going to be reading all night about the risk in trading VXX, and probably won't come up with an answer to my question, so I figured I'd ask you guys. \n\nI can take risks, but the thought of the company running VXX just closing it out and me losing everything is fucking scary. \n\nAny tips or reading that isn't a 500 page prospectus? \n\nThanks\n\nEdit: here's a link to the book for those who don't know about it. \nhttps://www.amazon.com/WallStreetBets-Boomers-Worlds-Biggest-Millennials/dp/B084DFNN2F\n\n\nEdit2: Thanks ceczar. You are a damn gentleman. Now I understand why XIV went under. \n\n\"the XIV issue cannot happen to VXX. it was particular to inverse ETNs. you should read this:\n\nhttps://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/02/06/2018/how-xiv-and-svxy-went-rails-and-took-market-them \"", "created_utc": 1583458665.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fe5zct/vxx_wins_today_could_it_implode/", "is_self": true}
