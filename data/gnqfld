If you have 100 or more shares, sell a covered call or two, then get out ASAP. DO NOT BUY OPTIONS ON THIS COMPANY!\n\nLet me preface this by saying: I AM NOT AN EXPERT, and this legal analysis is pretty new to me, but my novice DD is better than no information at all. If anyone has any deeper insight on this than I do, I'd love to hear it.\n\nAs we most likely all well know, Luckin Coffee is in some hot water (sorry I'm retarded). They falsified parts of their earnings report, trading was halted, but trading was allowed to resume today. A fuckton of trades were made on Luckin today, over 150m shares traded hands today alone. This is probably institutions dumping their shares as fast as possible. For the speculators out there, this may look like a good opportunity to scoop up some cheap shares of a company that is most likely undervalued at its current share price. But what you may not know is the risk that you face in 30 to 45 days. According to Luckin's website:\n\n>Luckin Coffee Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) (NASDAQ: LK) today announced that on May 15, 2020, it received a written notice (the \u201cNotice\u201d) from the Listing Qualifications Staff (the \u201cListing Qualifications Staff\u201d) of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) indicating that the Listing Qualifications Staff has determined to delist the Company\u2019s securities from Nasdaq. The Listing Qualifications Staff cited two bases for the delisting determination: (i) public interest concerns as raised by the fabricated transactions disclosed by the Company in a Form 6-K on April 2, 2020, pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5101; and (ii) the Company\u2019s past failure to publicly disclose material information, citing a business model through which the previously disclosed fabricated transactions were executed, pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250. The Company plans to timely request a hearing (the \u201cHearing\u201d) before a Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the \u201cPanel\u201d). The Company will remain listed on Nasdaq, pending the outcome of the Hearing. There can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company\u2019s request for continued listing. According to the Notice, the Hearing will typically be scheduled to occur approximately 30 to 45 days after the date of the hearing request.\n\nUH FUCKING OH MAN! Let me break it down for you. The financial grim reaper is coming to knock on Luckin's door in 30-45 days. In around a months time, $LK is in danger of being delisted from the NASDAQ. **In theory, if delisted, any investors will still own the same portion of the company, but** ***in practice, it means your shares will be worth nothing*****.** If delisted, institutional investors will lose interest, and the stock will have to be traded on a heavily unregulated market. I'm sure I don't have to tell you why that is a massive problem.\n\nBut I hear you saying \"They fixed all their problems so NASDAQ will allow them to stay listed!\". I highly doubt NASDAQ will allow Luckin to maintain its listing. After looking at all of the available NASDAQ Listing Council Decisions available on the NASDAQ website, 7 out of 9 companies with Rule 5101 violations were delisted. The two that were not delisted: \\*2014-1 - This one had something to do with the complications a company had filing bankruptcy. Not relevant to Luckin (but maybe soon). \\*2013-3 - The Listing Council explicitly stated that the \"...risk of investor harm is low\". That ship has already sailed for Luckin.\n\nThis quote from listing case 2012-1 is especially telling:\n\n>\"Listing Rule 5101 is not invoked lightly and, in instances in which a public interest concern is identified, the issues are very serious\"\n\nNASDAQ is not fucking around when it comes to these types of violations, and they will take a hard stance on Luckin in my view, especially given the current political climate.\n\nI think you get the picture now. So how do I make tendies off of this? The answer is you don't. Stay out of this mess if you can. I mostly wrote this to warn current option or share holders that they should get out of their position ASAP before they are left with nothing.", "created_utc": 1590036359.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gnqfld/luckin_coffee_what_is_happening_and_how_do_i_get/", "is_self": true}
