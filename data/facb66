Spoiler: It's pretty game over.", "selftext": "Background: data scientist / brogrammer / quick maths background, calls &amp; puts on the side.\n\nI'll save the technical lingo. I locked myself in my house for a week and dove as deep as possible into the real data we have on this beerflu, and modeled out how this could play out if it's not contained using something super autist called SIR modeling. I'm still locked in my house with a years worth of tendies - call me the gay bear doomer.\n\nFor all of the retards here. SIR modeling is how we figure out how fucked a population likely is when an epidemic happens, and what that timeline could look like. In this beerflu case, it's really, pretty fucked.\n\nHere's the high level of how it breaks down for us here in the US. Our response to this shit has been real retarded, CDC not testing, blah blah - it's all priced in we know what's going on there. But here's where everything really goes red. \n\nThis beerflu bastard is growing at an a pretty consistent, average rate of between 15% and 20% compound growth (day over day) on a per country bases. Takes a while for a lot of people to present sick, getting everyone else sick before they even realize.\n\nWhy's this bad? If you're not a full retard you know how exponential growth / exponential systems work. Shit looks slow, doesn't really seem to move at a macro level - and then boom full nuclear what seems like overnight.\n\nAs soon as that happens, it's really game over - hospitals get overwhelmed death rates are going to skyrocket.\n\nWhat else is the cherry on top? Oh yeah our medical supply chains have 80% to 90% dependency on some form of export out of China, so let's throw on major drug, equipment and other shortages that'll really start to pile on in April - right around when this shit is probably going to go full nuclear. \n\nI'll save you the rest of the details, if you wanna dive into the modeling of the USA and a bunch of other countries as well as the world (Don't be a retard, use the tabs at the bottom of the spreadsheet, the models differ by country) - link is below.\n\nHere ya go: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bS6S4oNRuMHD4ezh177QSf3UU6a8lQHv/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bS6S4oNRuMHD4ezh177QSf3UU6a8lQHv/view?usp=sharing)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tqw2854w0hj41.png?width=1394&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6104e1e736b8816dc2ac64e9aad45493c9a81bd\n\ntldr; I'm a gay bear doomer.
