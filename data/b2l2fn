{"id": "b2l2fn", "title": "Autism: 100", "selftext": "So, Friday I thought I'd buy some real faggy D's. I opened 100 put credit spreads (4/18 300/299) for .99 credit.\n\nHalf the puts I sold were called up before EOD so I woke up today with about 2.3M in SPY shares. Shit. So I sell, going for a gap fill at open and then sell the puts. RH ended up liquidating the account and selling all puts literally 3 minutes before the drop, where I would have instantly went in the black by the thousands at a time. \n\nI am now -7k on RH. I didn't have margin and they were cash secured but obviously that didn't help lol.\n\nAnyway, guess I'm done Robinhooding.\n\nShould've held the shares too the top or until RH sold themselves I guess. Fucked myself by trying to play a gap fill, that did happen, just not quick enough.\n\nBe safe out there autists.", "created_utc": 1552928028, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b2l2fn/autism_100/", "is_self": true}
