{"id": "dgwkiw", "title": "Globex Eurodollars/SOFR - Trade Idea", "selftext": "I figure most of you have lost money over the last few months, so here is a trade idea for you:  \n\n\nGE continuous Dec16'19 futures contract. (Globex Eurodollars).  \nGo long on Monday 21st (or at 98.05, whichever occurs first), close out on Thursday 24th (or at 98.30, whichever occurs first). Pays $25 per bps, with 20bps move expected the week before FOMC from current price (98.10) as big money hedges interest rate swaps. Do not go long if price is above 98.30 unless you expect 50 bps rate cut on 29th from FOMC.  \n\n\nMargin for 1 contract \\~$500. Leverage is 2500, so exposure is $250,000 per contract.  \n100 contracts gives $25,000,000 exposure on $50k margin. Expected move is 20 bps, so a $50k return over 2 days.  \n\n\nIf you do not like trading on the big money hedging, you can always trade the November contract on the 29th and close out on a 20 bps (or 98.25) target. Alternatively you can trade the big money move between 21st-24th and then use your profits to trade the November contract on FOMC day.  \n\n\nYou can also run FOPs for this idea... 2 examples:  \nEither GE Dec16'19 call @ 98.125 strike (currently 0.080, so $200 per FOP) for an expected return of \\~$237.50 per FOP at expiry. (18.75% return, trade on same days as futures trade idea)  \nOr GE Dec16'19 call @ 98.000 strike (currently 0.145, so $362.50 per FOP) for an expected return of  \\~$387.50 per FOP at expiry. (6.90% return but much lower risk, trade on same days as futures trade idea)\n\nYou are welcome, I will follow up later with an SOFR futures trade recommendation if this gets traction. Similar to this but mostly banks hedging and fewer HFs and Corps with rate risk, also tied directly to 3m Bill Yield instead of 3m LIBOR.  \n\n\nIf you just read all this and have no idea what eurodollars and SOFRs are then its probably best to go to avoid this trade.  \n\n\nIf you inverse me, screenshot and share so I can show my old colleagues how crazy this sub is.", "created_utc": 1570893985, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dgwkiw/globex_eurodollarssofr_trade_idea/", "is_self": true}
