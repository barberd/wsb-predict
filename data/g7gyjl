{"id": "g7gyjl", "title": "Small Cap Value - How to YOLO your IRA/401(k) intelligently", "selftext": "**TL;DR:** Multiple indicators that small cap value is stupid cheap right now compared to large growth stocks. **Historically at these prices, SCV has returned 28% annualized over the next 10 years.** You'll just have to stomach the fact that there will be *wild* swings during that time. Buy $IWN or $VBR to play casually. Buy ATM LEAPs on $IWN if you play hard.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the retards who skipped investing 101 and came straight here to YOLO on FDs (god bless you), **what is small cap value (SCV)?** *Small cap* refers to companies with small market capitalizations which is the total value of all their outstanding stock. \"Small\" depends on who you talk to; it's always less than $10BB and usually less than $5BB or $2BB. *Value* refers to companies that are cheap, usually compared to their revenue stream or their to total assets. Value companies are the ones that you target when you are trying to \"buy low\" compared to growth companies (like Tesla) that you are trying to \"sell high.\" Small cap value companies are rarely sexy, but they are good at paying the bills e.g. utilities, small banks, basic manufacturing, agriculture, small chains, electronics components, one-drug pharmas.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pump Incoming:**\n\nSince the big China flu drop, $IWN, which tracks the Russell 2000 value index has plummeted from an ATH of $130 to a low of $72 and has recovered to $85 [\\[source\\]](https://www.tiingo.com/iwn/overview). That is an \\~11% recovery (and current drop of 35%), which is far less than the nearly 30% recovery of $SPY. The reason is that small value stocks face much more risk than large stocks in being able to stay solvent and because daddy Powell is doing less to help small companies. Before the drop, small cap value was already trading at a significant historical discount to large growth stocks, but now the level of discount is unprecedented. The small companies that skillfully maneuver their way through the crisis and eat other companies' lunches are going to explode upwards afterwards as their valuations reach back up to and beyond where they were before.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**A Historic Opportunity in Small Cap Stocks**](https://www.osam.com/pdfs/A_Historic_Opportunity_in_Small_Cap_Stocks.pdf)\n\nIn the article above, they cite a number of metrics that show the power of SCV to rebound.\n\n1. Following the worst 25 quarters for small caps generally, which averages a 35% drawdown, their **yearly return was 38%** compared to only a 20% return on large caps.\n2. The price per earnings spread between SCV and LCG has grown to over 21%. The spread has been that large in less than 2% of all months the US stock market has been tracked and when it has been that large, *SCV has outperformed LCG by 16.8% annualized over the next 10 years*.\n3. The spread between price per earnings on SCV and interest on 10 year US treasuries has grown to over 21%. In the 1% of historical months that has been true, *SCV has returned 27.8% annualized over the next 10 years.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am probably a bigger, gayer bear than half of you. But the potential return here is just too good to pass up. I think there is (much) more downside coming, but I'm getting in now and doubling down if the bet becomes even more favorable.\n\nDon't be a retard and drop your entire retirement savings into SCV stocks. Put in an amount that you could stand to see drop by 50% without crying. The recovery might be some ways distant. If you have the balls to take on risky stocks that just got drop-kicked you very well could make hella tendies. It will work because it is counterintuitive and others are avoiding buying those same stocks right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Positions:**\n\nIRA: 10% $VBR, 10% a custom SCV fund I made in M1 finance that screens out companies in a worse financial state, DM me and I'll send you the link\n\n401(k): Entering a 15% position in Vanguard selected value fund and 5% position in Vanguard small cap fund on Monday\n\nFun money: puts, puts, and more puts", "created_utc": 1587763443.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7gyjl/small_cap_value_how_to_yolo_your_ira401k/", "is_self": true}
