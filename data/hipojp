Department of Defense researchers are pursuing their own vaccine effort**\n\nOn June 2, researchers and military brass at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and the US Army Medical Research Institute Infectious Disease Research Program (*USAMRIID, a big part of US infectious disease research, they have one of the very few BSL-4 labs in the US*) [held a call with reporters](https://www.defense.gov/Watch/Video/videoid/754709/) to describe updates on their coronavirus research programs. \n\nOf special interest to reporters was the fact that the US Army had identified a vaccine approach that it found very effective: nanoparticles made from ferritin (a hollow ball-like iron-carrying protein normally found in our bodies) synthesized to be recombinant with virus antigens.  You can see a rough diagram of such a vaccine [here](https://i.imgur.com/XA53ogQ.png), from [here](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/08/universal-flu-vaccine-horizon).\n\nListen in at 43:36 on the call, if you'd like to hear it. Basically, the Army scientist leading the vaccine research project describes that what they like about their nanoparticle approach is how it can be used to present antigens from different strains or even different species of coronavirus to the immune system, in a single vaccine. [My transcription](https://i.imgur.com/wdsRHtP.png)\n\nOn top of the multivalence potential of this spike ferritin nanoparticle vaccine, an article published June 12 talked about how *effective* the nanoparticle vaccine appeared to be in preclinical testing. [For example](https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/us-army-selects-spfn-its-coronavirus-vaccine-candidate) :\n\n>**Walter Reed Army Institute of Research said has chosen Spike Ferritin Nanoparticle for coronavirus vaccine study**\n\n>US Army scientists say they have a vaccine candidate with the potential to fight COVID-19 disease and protect individuals from future coronavirus infections, from season to season, and for decades to come.\n\n>The scientists at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research said to McClatchy news they have chosen Spike Ferritin Nanoparticle (SpFN), after testing dozens of variants of vaccine candidates.\n\n>**\u201cIt was a real sense of relief to discover a strong vaccine candidate,\u201d** Dr. Kayvon Modjarrad, director of Walter Reed\u2019s Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch, said in an exclusive interview with McClatchy.\n\n>**\u201cThe one that we selected from all those different versions, is one that actually, even after giving one dose, looks much better than if you were to give just the spike protein alone,** which is in other vaccines \u2014 if you gave multiple doses of that vaccine \u2014 **one dose of our vaccine looks better already,\u201d** Dr. Modjarrad said.\n\nThis tweet from [Army Futures Command on June 11](https://twitter.com/armyfutures/status/1271160991745744897) emphasizes how many other candidates they looked at before arriving on the spike + ferritin nanoparticle approach.\n\n**2. Novavax and DoD are pursuing the same approach**\n\nSo the Army is bullish on spike ferritin nanoparticle. What does that have to do with Novavax?\n\nNotably, two days after that June 2 DoD press conference call, [Novavax announced it had received major funding from the DoD to manufacture and deliver 10 million doses of their vaccine to DoD](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/05/2044076/0/en/Novavax-Awarded-Department-of-Defense-Contract-for-COVID-19-Vaccine.html). This is on top of the [$388 million Novavax was awarded by CEPI](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-receive-388-million-funding-cepi-covid-19-vaccine) NVAX recieved in early May.\n\nAs it turns out, Novavax also appears to be using a spike ferritin nanoparticle, or something very similar. They don't explicitly say what their nanoparticle is made of, but they apparently [transitioned away from Virus-Like Particle nanoparticles for their vaccines in 2016, toward a 'hemagglutinin nanoparticle' approach](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-new-seasonal-combination-respiratory-vaccine) (hemagglutinin being their antigen for the flu vaccine). (You can see these two approaches contrasted in this figure [here](https://i.imgur.com/QMDPD0p.png). [Sound familiar?](https://i.imgur.com/XA53ogQ.png) Compare to a figure of Novavax's nanoparticle [here](https://i.imgur.com/8o7ZAyT.png).\n\nNovavax doesn't actually say they use ferritin, but it seems likely they do and if they don\u2019t, they use something else functionally equivalent, so the most important takeaway is they are using the same basic approach that the Army chose above all others.\n\n\n**3. NVAX vs INO**\n\nDoD has also given a bunch of money to Inovio Pharmaceuticals recently, with [$71 million for their electroporating vaccine injection devices](https://newsfilter.io/articles/inovio-receives-71-million-contract-from-us-department-of-defense-to-scale-up-manufacture-of-cellect-96ee18dbdf5e72071964f3e2612d7d80), and there appears to be another $70 million headed Inovio's way for plasmid manufacturing scale up; and probably other big funding from other sources soon. Inovio has a number of advantages I'm not going to go in to here. [INO released a preliminary summary of their Phase I results today](http://ir.inovio.com/news-releases/news-releases-details/2020/INOVIO-Announces-Positive-Interim-Phase-1-Data-For-INO-4800-Vaccine-for-COVID-19/default.aspx), with a peer-reviewed publication in the works, as they did for their animal trials. I expect more investment to be going INO\u2019s way in the next several months, not just from DoD, based on the full Phase I data that insiders will have access to.\n\nSo DoD likes Inovio's tech too. However, DoD may have felt there were some stumbling blocks for DoD itself to go the DNA vaccine route, such as the fact that it would have to develop some sort of proprietary electroporator-injector like Inovio\u2019s. Or perhaps it likes the high potential multivalency of the nanoparticle approach. Or they don't have the benefit of Inovio's extensive R&D in developing DNA vaccines, and the ones DoD came up with weren't as good.  \n\nAnyway, for whatever reason, DoD felt that spike ferritin nanoparticle was the most effective and likely-to-succeed use of DoD research effort, money and time. \n\nAnd now that you know that, you can take advantage of the fact that Novavax already has a spike nanoparticle vaccine in trials, [with results expected in July](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/25/novavax-starts-phase-1-clinical-trial-of-coronavirus-vaccine-candidate.html).\n\n**4. NanoFlu**\n\nOn top of CV19, Novavax is killing it in terms of their NanoFlu flu vaccine effort, which has FDA final licensing imminent in the next few months, and there was just word of a pandemic flu strain popping up in China that came out on Monday 6/29, so there's a decent pipeline and market narrative for NVAX as well. For a bit more on NanoFlu, including some eye-popping sales projections upon approval, see [this Motley Fool writeup from June 6](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/06/why-is-everyone-talking-about-novavax-stock.aspx). In fact, NanoFlu may be the real value proposition for this stock, but that's a subject for a different DD.\n\n**5. Risks**: Some other vaccine maker(s) could beat Novavax to market, or swamp the market with a lower-cost version.  However, \n\n* I don't really see AZN/ChAdOx as a big competitor because their vaccine sucks, even though they will be first to market. \n\n* As far as the mRNA vaccines, like Warp Speed-approved efforts from Moderna and BionTech/Pfizer, I'm not super bullish on them because of the need for liposomal delivery of the RNA inside cells (which can cause side effects) and because of the cold chain requirement for mRNA. We don't know MRNA's full Phase I results yet however, and they could be quite good, but there are also some reasons to doubt. After what they pulled in May, it definitely leaves a bad taste in my mouth, especially since they still haven't released full Phase I results. \n\n* I think Inovio has the pole position for best results and lowest side effects. But there is room for more than one player in the vaccine market.\n\n* Also, it's not clear what sort of pricing Novavax could charge for its vaccines. Hopefully, they won't give away a significant fraction of IP in return for scale-up funding, like Moderna did.\n\n**6. tl;dr** Assuming these risks don't come true, the tl;dr is that I think it's very interesting that an institution as prestigious and well-regarded as USAMRIID has in some sense pre-empted Operation Warp Speed and already made its choice for the best CV19 vaccine, and also that that choice is already embodied in a commercial development effort, via Novavax. \n\nNovavax is expected to have preliminary CV19 vaccine results [by July](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-trial-is-designed-to-be-very-compressed-expect-results-in-july-155320617.html), which should be early enough for 8/21 calls to make sense.\n\nMy positions: \n\n$INO 8/21 20c ([held since May](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/499/826/2f0.png))\n\n$NVAX 8/21 110c (bought today, after selling INO 7/17 20c, also held since May)\n\n\nDisclaimer: do your own DD. I\u2019m not doing a rigorous business case based on projected earnings for CV19 vaccine. I welcome any feedback along those lines. It\u2019s quite possible all of the above has already been priced in. At a market cap of $5 billion, NVAX's value has more than increased beyond the [tripling from $700 million this article from April 2 envisioned](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/02/novavax-stock-could-triple-in-value-by-2022.aspx).
