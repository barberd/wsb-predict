{"id": "fwhtzy", "title": "The Big Long", "selftext": "Wirecard (WDI) :\nSo let me introduce myself by saying I have been a gay ass bear getting his ass burned the past few days. But that's not the matter here.\n\nI'm totally long on a stock named Wirecard (WDI). This one is a fintech with industry-leading margins and is totally undervalued at 15* forward PE. So why is that? Because the company is accused of round-tripping, basically a fraudulent way of blowing up revenues.\n\nSo now here is this crazy dude saying you should go long, because the report from KPMG is going to he released on 4/22. Now, in Germany you need to release a so-called adhoc news if anything bad has been found yet. Since the report is ongoing since November and no news have occured yet I am super bullish. In addition to that there is no logical way how they can boost their revenues, because they would require a complex network of partner companies that artificially buy their products. Moreover, no position on the balance sheet can either be easily bloated (except goodwill but since they haven't sold a subsidiary it is not possible that way) or has gone out of proportion in the past years.\n\nI am a german bull so my sources are in German as well. If you still want some links just ask me otherwise my positions are:\n\nTR8NZ6\nTR4W4U\n\nI have been fucked by Corona recently, but since the company has kept its guidance of 30+% growth in times of crisis it should still skyrocket when the report is positive.\n\nRight now I'm looking to add more money into options with smaller spreads (I bought the others when their spreads were decent).", "created_utc": 1586253440.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fwhtzy/the_big_long/", "is_self": true}
