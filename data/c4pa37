This has been a fun week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDD:\n\nS3 just put out their borrow rates and here they are. \"BYND short interest is $920 million; 5.97 million shares short; 50.96% of float; 113% borrow fee on existing shorts and 170% to 275% fee on new stock borrows. Shares shorted increased by 697k, +13.2%, last week as [~~#~~**Beyondmeat**](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Beyondmeat?src=hash)'s stock price rose by 1.75%\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got 213% borrow rate from calling around. IB told me there is a short selling restriction due to the uptick rule in place on the stock (will be taken down tomorrow). They said rule 201. Not sure how accurate that is, though...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I am still holding in anticipation of a squeeze but this has been painful the past week. And PLEASE don't follow my advice. This is a super volatile stock and I have been wrong in the past!
