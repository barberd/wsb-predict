I've stopped \"investing\" for a while now, but I see a potential trade here given how bad the situation seems being on the inside. I'm doing this out of pure boredom.\n\n\\----------------------------------------\n\nLink to DD: [https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/cso9oe/head\\_of\\_respawn\\_responded\\_to\\_the\\_recent\\_things/](https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/cso9oe/head_of_respawn_responded_to_the_recent_things/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust look at the thread above.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApex Legends is basically EA's shot at becoming the next Fortnite and it doesn't seem to be going too well. What happened a week ago is Apex's first event which was a total debacle. They added a bunch of new skins, but all of them are considered grossly overpriced by the community (see comments on thread).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Dev eventually called their gaming community \"Asshats\" and \"Freeloaders\" (See below)\n\n[https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/18/20811014/apex-legends-iron-crown-skins-developers-rant-ass-hats-freeloaders-pc-ps4-xbox-one](https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/18/20811014/apex-legends-iron-crown-skins-developers-rant-ass-hats-freeloaders-pc-ps4-xbox-one)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm too lazy to describe the rest of the situation. The community is outraged though and people (me included) have uninstalled (I uninstalled just out of disinterest; can't seem for others).\n\n\\--------------------\n\nI don't know what portion Apex Legends is of EA's portfolio (you'll have to figure that out). \n\nHolding everything else constant (assume that nothing else is going on with EA to move its price at the moment, market doesn't rally, competitor gaming company earnings call beat, etc.), I see this as a reason to short the stock. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* This is not financial advice.", "created_utc": 1566268893, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/csrnhq/short_ea_eas_apex_legends_devteam_and_community/", "is_self": true}
