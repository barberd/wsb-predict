But the downtrend is losing steam, at least from a purely technical standpoint. Make some more tendies then gtfo around 215 until further notice. If you\u2019re in above 235 you\u2019re golden.

COVID-19 is spreading in the US faster than it did in Italy. Italian deaths/day are still increasing. State jobs reports are coming out this Thursday and based on unemployment claims it\u2019s going to be terrible.  \n \n\nAnalysis: Longer interval momentum indicators are still decidedly bearish however KDJ on all intervals is decidedly oversold. MACD on 1D is also converging slightly. KDJ convergences and Net Volume convergences are indicating early signs of a bull-trap. Although in the week ahead bearish positions are still justifiable positions longer term are exposed to too much risk to justify. Possible 2% gap down or more on Monday. Keep watching futures and news to confirm. Look for short/put entries EOW or early in the next week if bull trap is confirmed. Major resistance around 260 would be the ideal entry.\n\nWeBull Charts: [https://imgur.com/gallery/hes4YEA](https://imgur.com/gallery/hes4YEA)\n\nVolume Analysis: https://imgur.com/tY0Zz1E\n\nAlternative Plays: $GME, $AAL, $EWZ, $EWW,", "created_utc": 1584917324.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fn8yap/spy_technical_analysis_bearish_215p_417/", "is_self": true}
