{"id": "gny8tq", "title": "Let's talk about the near-term future for $AMD", "selftext": "$AMD has been a hero to many portfolios. It should continue to do so, but there are some things to keep in mind:\n\n$AMD might have powerful laptop CPUs, but $INTC has deals in place with current laptop manufacturers which, unfortunately for $AMD, results in top mobile graphic cards being paired with $INTC CPUs. I could not find a single laptop with an $AMD CPU supported by anything above an RTX 2060, which is the lowest of the new top-end mobile graphic chips.\n\n$AMD has a terrible marketing team. $AMD does not communicate with their community as well as $INTC does. $INTC is very active in the community, which helps keep $INTC a household name, something that will continue to have a negative impact on $AMD's market share. Before you blame marketing on budgetary constraints, keep in mind that good marketing doesn't have to be expensive, especially when the communities are all digitally connected.\n\n$AMD has incredibly low power chips, which is a huge advantage. If you haven't been keeping up with what exactly makes $AMD such a sexy stock, it's probably the fact that $AMD is making 7nm mobile chips, while their rival $INTC is still working with 14nm chips. Size matters with CPUs, and the smaller often offers significant advantages.\n\nThat isn't to say that $AMD is a clear winner, despite low-power options. There are still some things that $AMD CPUs fall behind on. In the past, $AMD was notorious for having much slower single-thread processing time, compared to the same price range $INTC chip. The gap is closing very rapidly, but many gamers still opt for $INTC CPUs because $AMD CPUs just don't have the same great track record with gaming performance that $INTC does. (I foresee this changing as more people use the new top end $AMD chips).\n\n$INTC is somewhat known for being stingy on their intellectual property, somewhat like the $DIS of chipmakers. This means that features are sometimes missing in $AMD computers. For example, Thunderbolt 3 just recently started being officially supporter by $AMD. There is a lot of back and forth between the intellectual properties of $AMD and $INTC, but things are mostly amicable. This is important to keep in mind, as it means that $AMD gaining market share won't necessarily devalue $INTC faster than they grow. \n\nBeyond $INTC, $AMD must also consider how viable their graphic division is. $AMD graphic cards are considered inefficient, and perform generally worse than $NVDA graphic cards. $AMD GPU drivers have a history of being buggy. Most gamer enthusiasts will opt for an $NVDA GPU over an $AMD GPU. Thus, this is a double whammy against $AMD, because the laptops that have the good $NVDA GPUs, are paired with $INTC CPUs.\n\nWhat this all means, is that the future success of $AMD isn't quite priced in. Fair value for $AMD is probably about $45-55 right now. We will see new releases from $AMD later in 2020, to include better laptop pairings, which could result in $AMD killing it in earnings. $AMD's GPU division needs work, but saying that $AMD GPUs are trash would be a straight up lie. \n\nMy positions: $57c 7/17 because I don't trust this market. My target price is $AMD $70 by Jan 2021 based on anticipation in the nerd communities for the new $AMD hardware. **Keep in mind that $AMD is trading near their peak right now** so there is downward pressure to consider.", "created_utc": 1590072680.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gny8tq/lets_talk_about_the_nearterm_future_for_amd/", "is_self": true}
