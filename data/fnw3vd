Would you jump on the wagon of people shorting it? \n\nIt\u2019s highest estimate was around $150, and the CEO and CFO are selling their shares. If they don\u2019t have the confidence to believe the price would rise, why should everyone else. \n\nI think people who keep buying Zoom are dumbasses, people should buy Tencent Music, which is incredibly undervalued compared to the insane crack smoking investors who are driving up Zoom\u2019s price. TME is still sitting around $9.5 despite beating Q4 estimates, which caused it to drop from $11 somehow. \n\nBuy TME short ZOOM", "created_utc": 1585012477.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnw3vd/zoom_and_tme/", "is_self": true}
