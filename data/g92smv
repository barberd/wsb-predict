Instead of buying Puts that expire worthless on expiration, buy a call credit spread deep in the money. \n\nLet's use SPY as an example: you buy a long call 4/29 266$ for 20.13 but then short a call 4/29 $265 for 21.13. The difference is credit, $100, if SPY stays above $267. If it drops below $267 before the EOD then you slowly lose your collateral ($100), BUT J-POWELL will never let that happen. So you can easily double your money with no risk at all!\n\nMake it rain tendies bois!", "created_utc": 1588001226.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g92smv/how_to_print_money_with_call_credit_spreads/", "is_self": true}
