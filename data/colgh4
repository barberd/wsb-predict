I hope everyone on this subreddit made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 12th, 2019.\n\n# **Week ahead could bring more volatility as worries over trade and the economy linger  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/09/week-ahead-could-bring-more-volatility-as-worries-over-trade-and-the-economy-linger.html)**\n*****\n&gt; After a whipsawing week, stocks could face more volatile swings as investors assess new information on trade and the strength of the economy.\n*****\n&gt; There are just a few earnings in the week ahead with Walmart, Cisco Systems,Nvidia and Deere reporting as the second-quarter earnings season winds down.\n*****\n&gt; Some pretty important economic reports are coming, however, spread across the week, with CPI inflation data Tuesday, and a load of key reports Thursday, including retail sales, PCE inflation data, industrial production and regional Fed surveys.\n*****\n&gt; But it is the behavior of the stock markets investors will be watching. It will be important to see how stocks react to variables like the level of Treasury yields and Chinese currency, which could be a bellwether for trade talks should the Chinese central bank allow the yuan to lose much more value.\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also be watching to see what signal the stock market sends after outsized moves in both directions this week.\n*****\n&gt; Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, said he believes the worst is over and stocks could trade at their highs again by the end of the month.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think what we went through was a retest of the May pullback and it ended up being successful,\u201d he said. Stovall said he has been watching the sub industries of the S&amp;P 1500, and as of July 12, 91% were above their 50-day moving average, an unusually high number.\n*****\n&gt; But as of Monday, when stocks were cratering, just 10% were above their 50-day moving average.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cThat to me was an indication of a washout,\u201d Stovall said. He added that it was also a rapid move to the 5% decline level from the peak, indicating the market could make a quick comeback.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe are probably coming out of this pullback, and we\u2019ll probably get there quickly. History says we\u2019ll get there by the end of the month, meaning by the end of the month we\u2019ll probably close with a new all-time high,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; Despite additional losses on Friday, stocks regained most of the steep losses from earlier in the week. The Dow ended the week down 0.75%. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite finished the week down 0.5% and 0.6%, respectively. After Monday\u2019s close, the Dow and S&amp;P 500 had plunged around 3% while the Nasdaq had lost 3.5%.\n*****\n&gt; But in the bond market, investors may continue to see the lowest yields in years. In the past week, Treasury yields moved lower in a dramatic global slideamid concerns about global growth and as the world\u2019s central banks have been cutting interest rates.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cTrade tensions have unambiguously caused global growth to slow down, U.S. growth to slow and caused inflation to decelerate. That\u2019s quite clear. That\u2019s all the White House,\u201d said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies.\n*****\n&gt; Treasury yields went on a wild ride in the past week, with the 10-year dipping as low as 1.59% from as high as 2.08% the week earlier.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re in the crazy time of the summer ... when volumes are thin, moves tend to be exaggerated. That\u2019s probably what we should expect,\u201d McCarthy said.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks reacted negatively to the move in yields and to a drop in the Chinese yuan below a former red line level of 7 per dollar. Bond yields, in terms of basis points, last moved this fast right after President Donald Trump was elected.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cAs this things accelerate, the [bond] market has been dealing with known unknowns, and now you\u2019re starting to see people worrying about unknown unknowns. We\u2019re in dangerous territory,\u201d said McCarthy. \u201cThere\u2019 s a widespread perception that there\u2019s a race to the bottom going on here in yields, and it\u2019s not necessarily the U.S. that\u2019s driving this. It\u2019s the fact we\u2019re the high yielding market.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; As rates also fall on foreign sovereign debt, U.S. Treasurys, with a higher yield, look more attractive and lure buyers. Rates move opposite price, so yields move lower when prices turn higher.\n*****\n&gt; As for the Chinese currency, the market was surprised when China failed to defend it, allowing it to sink below 7 to the dollar. The move was seen as a reaction to the latest round of tariffs Trump threatened to impose on China, effective Sept. 1.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to make any kind of definitive material decision about what\u2019s going on in China because there\u2019s no verifiable data to work with,\u201d said Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities. \u201cIf the Chinese really have the capability to keep this from blowing up, they\u2019re not going to let this blow up.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; As for economic data, McCarthy said the CPI and retail sales data will be particularly important. \u201cI think retail sales will be solid. Everything we see on the household side is good. CPI headline could be feisty. Gasoline prices will boost it by more than a tenth,\u201d he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/g307taP.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/g5EgBYr.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/CMBpjsM.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/6OYUNU7.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/KK6C4Ch.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/u6YT7Ra.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/gQsyc52.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SScAKfE.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bDoH92m.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FNHhDv5.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/BI1hEWQ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/lBH1ox3.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/w8P02In.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/SWhFaDa.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Perfect \"Shrug\" Pattern Emerges for the S&amp;P 500\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ripped higher by nearly 2% yesterday on no significant news, and when combined with gains seen over the prior two days, the index gained back all of its losses from Monday\u2019s 3% drop.\n\n&gt; The technicals show a near perfect double bottom formed from the intraday lows on Monday and Wednesday. The 2,830 level proved to be very strong support that saw buyers step in just when things looked their bleakest this week.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/intraday.png))**\n\n&gt; To throw some levity into the mix, the intraday chart of the S&amp;P 500 over the last week has amazingly formed a perfect \u201cshrug\u201d pattern from the famous emoji that you\u2019ve likely seen before in texts or on social media (especially if you have teenage kids)! A picture is certainly worth 1,000 words. Talk about the perfect description of this market!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/shrug.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Another Summer Storm\n\n&gt; U.S. stocks have hit another trade-induced summer storm.\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index fell 3% on Monday, its worst day since December 2018. The index is now about 6% from record highs in U.S. stocks\u2019 worst bout of volatility since May.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Storms Happen Often in U.S. Stocks, stock volatility this year has been relatively subdued compared to history. The S&amp;P 500 has declined an average of 14% from peak to trough since 1990, and even in positive years, the index has dropped an average of 11% during the year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/gWgqf6z.png))**\n\n&gt; \u201cThough the volatility has been uncomfortable, it\u2019s normal for U.S. stocks to endure periodic pullbacks,\u201d said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. \u201cThese experiences typically provide opportunities for suitable investors to rebalance, diversify portfolios toward targeted allocations, or to add to equity positions based on what we see as a generally favorable macroeconomic environment.\u201d\n\n&gt; Stocks\u2019 recent sell-off has been especially brisk. Just 10 days ago on July 26, the S&amp;P 500 reached a new all-time high, bolstered by Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut hopes, improving economic data, and cooling trade tensions. Since then, the Fed\u2019s rate cut and messaging wasn\u2019t met with investor enthusiasm, the United States threatened tariffs on $300 billion in Chinese goods, and China pulled prior commitments to purchase U.S. agriculture goods. In addition, China\u2019s central bank let its currency (the yuan) fall below the key 7 per dollar level that some view as a line in the sand relative to currency manipulation.\n\n&gt; The fundamental picture for stocks hasn\u2019t really changed, though. Economic growth has exceeded expectations, inflation and interest rates are low, and second quarter earnings have been better than expected. Trade uncertainty continues to weigh on global markets, but tariffs haven\u2019t significantly affected the domestic economy and the Fed has indicated willingness to loosen policy as needed. While there are still geopolitical risks, including trade, a review of all of the above fundamentals suggests to us that the odds of an imminent recession are quite low.\n\n&gt; We\u2019ll continue to watch the trade and front monetary policy, along with their impacts to the U.S. dollar, economic output and corporate profit growth. For now, though, we see few reasons that suggest this market pullback will result in anything more than a typical correction, and we maintain our belief that the S&amp;P 500 is fairly valued in the range of 3,000 by year-end.\n\n*****\n\n# Sticking to the Game Plan\n\n&gt; Okay, so the market has been volatile the past two weeks reacting to the Fed rate cut and more so the U.S.-China trade dispute. But in reality this is precisely the typical summer, especially early-August, seasonal weakness we have been warning about, so we are not panicking, but that does not mean the market is out of the woods yet. There is still some technical work to be done.\n\n&gt; At the risk of being repetitive, we remind you that the market continues to track the seasonal patterns closely, which suggests to us that it is likely to continue to do so. The chart below of the Pre-Election Year Seasonal Patterns clearly illustrates that despite somewhat greater amplitude DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have been following the seasonal trend this year. The late-July/early-August drop we just experienced came right on cue, which puts us on an upward trajectory through mid-September before another reversal into late-October.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/08814bbc57f7fec02cea55d894aa0a47/44b1ab85c9708a41-64/s500x750/02cf4e5d162fae7663b1489043f7274f64042c91.jpg))**\n\n&gt; But things will need to continue to get constructive technically soon or else further declines become a higher probability. In the next chart we have updated the technical support and resistance levels for the S&amp;P 500.\n\n&gt; The Down Friday/Down Monday (DF/DM) broke through initial support at S&amp;P 2875 near the old January 2018 highs, but we held the next level of support at 2815 where the S&amp;P failed intraday back on November 7, 2018, before the December selloff, which was rather constructive. Today\u2019s rally was further improvement, but we have yet to reclaim the level before this past DF/DM. The sooner we clear this new overhead resistance around 2955 near the May 1 intraday high and the close of Thursday August 1 just prior to this latest DF/DM, the better the technical picture will be.\n\n&gt; If we cannot take out 2955 soon and then breach the next level of support the situation begins to look like the beginning of the selloff last October. Support at 2775 runs through several gaps and consolidations, but the next level of support around 2725 where we held in early June is important. 2650 is minor support below there, but critical support sits at the old February/April 2018 lows 2580.\n\n&gt; If we can retake 2955 in short order then we would expect the market to drift higher into mid-September, perhaps logging minor new highs.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/78a7a04398f9a0924616f1be83fa821f/44b1ab85c9708a41-74/s500x750/c337baf02495c00cfe30d233786fbb6138752822.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# August Summer Market Storms Are Common\n\n&gt; Mild summer market storms like we are experiencing so far this August have been a common occurrence over the years. After the banner rally we have been having this type of selloff should not be surprising. However, from our analysis of Down Augusts, it can get dicey for the rest of the year if August losses deepen and if September is down as well. You can see in the tables below that the market has usually weathered these typical mild August market declines in stride. It\u2019s mostly the larger losses at the top of the list accompanied by losses in September that have nasty market years. Years like 2019 with big gains year-to-date at the end of July that had August market storms fared better.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/16db10e41530df7f23c174b684cab277/afc688f4021c29af-e5/s500x750/eb2d8527a1ea0b20eb4651b617fd2ae31eea49ec.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/adb6ac19fa7c8a78f9e8907aaac9d71f/afc688f4021c29af-e3/s500x750/638484fa5eebc5375f5a3c36b2aef89596410972.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9fc91acde5cd26a916f3bd94995fdb5c/afc688f4021c29af-11/s500x750/cfcf8d8f0e7259e15bab53258b42f93b706d288b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending August 9th, 2019** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5op0BHYAM3g))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 08.11.19**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/bDoH92m.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Sc3visp.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN ON MONDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/NgFi5hS.jpg))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/EiIrcka.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.12.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/VecJMir.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 8.12.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ur2IUlk.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.13.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hze60CI.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 8.13.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/gAWETzY.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.14.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3JeqCnQ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 8.14.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/RDsaoJc.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.15.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0iLQZ1w.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 8.15.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hFBQOY2.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.16.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/gOIbE4Q.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 8.16.19 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# NVIDIA Corp. $154.18 \n&gt; **NVIDIA Corp.
