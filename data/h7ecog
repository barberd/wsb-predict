Hopefully we won't have to have jobs much longer if these TQQQ puts print. \n\nIf you don't know about the Dark Pool Index or \"DIX\" go over to  [Their Website](https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix) and read the white paper. If you have the IQ to understand it, this is a tool that can help confirm or lend useful info on what the next day brings. If you don't don't have the IQ to understand it then please stop trying to trade options. I'll still summarize it for you idiots so you'll have the capacity to finish the post. \n\nThe Dark Index has 2 main parts: the DIX and the GEX. When plotted on the S&P they can be used together to track \"dark pool\" private exchanges. These are private exchanges where buying and selling occurs without immediately being reflected in the market. Market makers and big money use them and the effects fade into the market if you will. \n\n[The DIX](https://preview.redd.it/hpp7f72jie451.png?width=1171&format=png&auto=webp&s=5dd2b1d7212083a8a1e732cfe3894afec01726e0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The GEX](https://preview.redd.it/hhothybyie451.png?width=1176&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d215fc6d31f78f57b14a1de420de3c57d0af46e)\n\nGenerally folks have looked at the Dark Index as a way to gauge what the \"institutions\" are up to because the DIX value indicates either **net buying** or **net selling.** According to their white paper, a DIX value over 45% indicates dark pools are **net buying.** The GEX can be viewed as the \"brakes\" or \"gas pedal\" on whatever the DIX suggests depending on how high it is and in relative terms. \n\nWhat stands out on June 10 is one of the things that prompted me to [call the top](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h0iz8p/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_june_11_2020/ftmm69r/?context=3) yesterday. The GEX posted a value of $9.6 billion that was in the top 10 highest prints since 2011. It was also the highest DIX/GEX combination EVER. This needed some added attention for sure.\n\nGenerally there's an inverse correlation in the data between the DIX and GEX. Remember the GEX is a measure of MM's **hedging obligations** to remain \"delta neutral\" in the market. This took a little refresher on [gamma exposure](https://systematicindividualinvestor.com/2020/01/23/what-do-you-mean-gamma-exposure/). So I wondered...Why on earth would we have a local S&P high with a DIX indicating a continued rally, but a GEX that is absurdly high? I also considered that the June 10 [put/call ratio](https://markets.cboe.com/us/options/market_statistics/daily/?mkt=cone&dt=2020-06-10) sat at .7 with an index put/call ratio of 1.33. \n\nSo there's overall more call options in the market, but the indexes have drastically more puts? And market makers are hedging more than ever against a \"sustained\" rally? WTF is going on? I thought the DIX was supposed to tell us what the big money was up to?\n\nUltimately I left the DIX a bit confused, but the high GEX and other factors strongly indicated a reversal was imminent.\n\nThen after the mayhem today I saw an interesting [tweet](https://twitter.com/MarginCall4/status/1270490578749280256?s=20) and realized...**WE ARE ALSO INCLUDED IN THE DIX.** \n\n**Ok, now knowing:**\n\n1. High DIX/GEX still resulted in the biggest 1-day decline since 2008\n2. The Market Makers **trade** privately and **operate** on retail exchanges, so retail is reflected in the Dark Index\n\nGoing into 6/12 the GEX has fallen to $2.6B with a DIX all the way up to 47.7%. Put/call ratio today turned more bearish at 1.01 overall and 1.34 on the indexes (again)\n\n**Conclusions:** the trading activity typically reflected in the DIX/GEX no longer contains usual dark pool trader volume such as institutions and insiders. Despite a DIX value that *should* have indicated net buying/green we PLUMMETED. This leads me to believe retail is alone in this market and there's nothing but air under us once we stop bidding everything up and \"buying the dip\".\n\n**Prediciton based on the conclusion above**: The \"buy the dip\" gang makes a valiant effort tomorrow and we fall like a rock, thus confirming that big money is out and huge declines are in store.\n\nThis idea will be nullified if we rally and stay green, which is what the DIX numbers from tonight would *typically* indicate", "created_utc": 1591937867.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h7ecog/these_dix_are_not_as_big_as_you_think/", "is_self": true}
