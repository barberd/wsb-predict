{"id": "fpwjj1", "title": "DD - Covid news from Italy", "selftext": "Hello folks, quick and brief report from spaghettiland.  \n\nDo you know all this fuzz about Covid? It is actually way worse than expected, because numbers aren't right.  \n\nSo what's up? Simple! There's loads of people showing syntomps that doesn't get tested. They get told to stay home in quarantine, and that's it! Actual numbers for infected people are higher than what's reported officially. I cannot quantify the magnitude of this, but I'd say that the issue lies in testing capabilities that can't keep up with the number of potential cases. How do I know this? Well, I live in one of the hardest hit cities (Parma) and I got more than one report of this procedure from different sources.  \n\nOn top of this, a recent article has shown that death numbers don't fit: in this little study performed by 2 physicians, the number of Total Flu Deaths vs Covid Deaths vs Expected \"Normal Flu\" Deaths is plotted.  \n\nResult? There's a spike in total deaths corresponding to beer flu arrival, but the numbers are skewed if compared to expected \"normal flu\" deaths: there's 5 times the expected deaths, but only 30% of these are reported as Covid deaths, what about the rest? This means there's a lot of deaths that are not classified as Covid cases, but actually are Covid cases. And that's understandable: there's not enough tests for everyone, so you go back home and die. No test = not a Covid case. Ez  \n\nTL;DR beer flu numbers are skewed. Actual numbers are higher than reported (for Italy at least), while death % is probably lower than reported (it would get lower with more tests available, see Diamond Princess reports that estimate death % at 1-2 max).  \n\nNow imagine living in Spain or UK 2 weeks from now. Or in the US next month. Peace", "created_utc": 1585314120.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpwjj1/dd_covid_news_from_italy/", "is_self": true}
