PUTS on ($MAR, $WYND, $H, $PK) (03/20 - 04/~) expiration. The focus has been on casinos, not hotels, until now.** (***easy difficulty***)\n-\n\n**Alright establishing credibility** (***HARD difficulty***): \n\nI work with large companies, events, entertainment and HEAR a lot from idiot employees OF said companies. **I'm not stating I have information that is unknown to the public. I just know how these events work. The safety and government interaction behinds these events is insane and you don't even see it.**\n\n I pushed the LYV put and AMD dd's if you remember me. \n\n**The presentation of the main argument (*IMPOSSIBLE*)**:\n\nIf you like a sense of confidence with your investments; this ones for you. \nPeople were saying \"short hotel stocks: MGM, LVS.\". They were focusing on the fact of tourism and gambling being impacted. Nobody was focused on the actual hotel industry. The revenue for these major Vegas hotels mostly comes from gambling, different from everywhere else. Hotels actually get their majority room nights booking from events. Make the connection? Everything is getting cancelled. \n\nI need to give a quick lesson about cities and how event centers work with them (you can probably skip this paragraph but it helps). Most convention centers operate at a loss, and that's the plan. City's work directly with event centers to attract events. These events drive economic growth for the city. Convention centers receive a large portion of their operating costs from the cities board. The cycle is government &gt; the CC &gt; hotels and continue with hotel tax to the city to repeat (think room nights). \n\n**tiny tldr; ($convention revenue &gt; $hotels &gt; $government) and it's cycles. purpose; economic growth.**\n\nHere's where it gets interesting. Business to Leisure travel is a 1:2.1 ratio on average. Where do hotels get most of their revenue? Rooms right? Yes but, not by a long shot. By a small margin close to rooms is Food and Beverage **(F&amp;B)** revenue. Not from room service, from events. Think catering and cooperate events. Cooperate event's are getting cancelled left and right. Add up this F&amp;B revenue/business revenue and you have? A majority of hotel revenue is about to disappear. (Seriously catered event's are insanely expensive; ($40 a plate for steaks x 700 guests).\n\n**tiny tldr; (hotel revenue = events (by majority) = cancelled)**\n\n**Now this is where it gets really f****** **juicy.** A majority of these are combined. A Marriott for example hosts convention space (THE 3RD LARGEST REVENUE GENERATOR). RIP to their incomes. \n\nWhat hotels will get the most F****** in order (personal opinion based off operations and support):\n\n1. Hyatt\n2. Wyndham\n3. Marriott\n4. Hilton\n\nRead the supplementary links if you'd like to read more. ^\n\nPeople focused on casinos not hotels. It's a lose worse than people think.
