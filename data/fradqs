{"id": "fradqs", "title": "Banks are trading well below book value", "selftext": "As you all know the market has been acting strange lately.  In fact, things haven't been this volatile since my wife's boyfriend got mad at me for not cleaning my dishes.  It seems like the market is no longer willing to put debt out of their minds and are now starting to price it in.  How can we tell?   \n Well, we can look at the book value of certain banks with a lot of exposure to the debt market and compare it with what the market thinks these shares are worth.  Book value is the total equity (assets minus liabilities) of a company divided by the total number of shares of that company.  So, in a sense, the book value is exactly what your stake in the company should be worth.  If the market is trading above book value it means most have faith that the company will grow or they believe in its brand.  On the other hand, especially for banks, if the market is trading  below book value then investors think assets are understated or liabilities are overstated.  With that in mind lets look at market value divided by book value (based on December 2019 earnings) of Citigroup and Wells Fargo:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCitigroup: 0.49\n\nWells Fargo: 0.76\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow SPX is only down about 25% since December and both of these banks have small stakes in equities so I don't think that alone solves the balance sheet mystery.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince citigroup is trading 50% below book value, investors really aren't buying Citigroup's balance sheet.  Here is their earnings report from December\n\n [https://www.citigroup.com/citi/investor/data/qer419s.pdf?ieNocache=264](https://www.citigroup.com/citi/investor/data/qer419s.pdf?ieNocache=264) \n\non page 3 we see that they have a total of 400 billion in corporate loans and 300 billion in consumer loans out of 2 trillion in total assets.  Since they are trading at 50% book value, the market is basically pricing these loans at much less than half their value.  Now compare this with Wells Fargo:\n\n [https://www08.wellsfargomedia.com/assets/pdf/about/investor-relations/earnings/fourth-quarter-2019-earnings.pdf](https://www08.wellsfargomedia.com/assets/pdf/about/investor-relations/earnings/fourth-quarter-2019-earnings.pdf) \n\non page 28 we can see that about half of their assets (1 trillion) are in loans and yet their book value is at 0.76.  \n\nAll this, I believe, supports my claim that corporate and consumer debt isn't as valuable as before and that there is some price discovery out there.  \n\nHere is the debt/equity ratio of some big companies (negative means more liabilities than assets)\n\nMcDonalds: -6.54\n\nBoeing: -2.4\n\nGoldman Sachs: 1.9\n\nGE: 2.36\n\nDisney: 0.5\n\n  Boeing has already been hammered into the ground so I'm not sure if there is much of a short opportunity left, however, note that McDonalds has much more of a debt burden and is only down 13% from last year.  Thus it's very possible this debt hasn't been priced in.  Some might argue that the markets are all knowing and efficient.  To that I will give the following joke,\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntwo economists walk down the road.  One says, \"look!  There's a $20 bill on the ground.\"  The other says, \"that can't be a real $20 bill because if it was then someone would have already picked it up.\"  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n  Right now all my money is tied up selling Disney vertical call spreads but I'll be adding some short delta to $MCD soon.  My suggestion is call credit spreads with a month till expiration.  I the stock gets within 50 cents of your short strike roll it out a week or two to collect extra premium and then wait it out.  The width should be about 2 strikes wide so you can collect more if it drops significantly.  I don't want to buy puts because this whole thing is a long shot and I want to be able to recover my money if McDonalds suddenly pulls through.
