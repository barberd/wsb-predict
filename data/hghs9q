Delta was planning multiple EU routes to open up next month. Think about the recent virus increase and how long it's going to take to go down... even if it's only zoomers getting sick, even if FL, TX and Los Angeles went into full lockdown today, even if hospitalizations and deaths don't go up which they obviously will, it would take 2 months at best before the US will get the greenlight from the EU to travel there. Nobody here is going to EU for a long fuckin time.\n\nPOS: bags, i don't want to talk about it ok", "created_utc": 1593211238.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hghs9q/europe_finalizes_71_travel_list_no_nasty_yanks/", "is_self": true}
