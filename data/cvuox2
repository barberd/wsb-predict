{"id": "cvuox2", "title": "$JNJ Straddle Exit Strategy help", "selftext": "Looking for some advice on a situation below?\n\nNote, I am mostly a futures and equity trader.  I have traded futures for over 20 years and stocks for over 30. \n\nIn candor, I have very little knowledge of options. \n\nI dabble in options and mostly just to hedge long or short positions that I swing for a few days. Today I learned about a lawsuit outcome for Johnson &amp; Johnson and I impulse bought a straddle.  I'm trying to figure out best method to exit it tomorrow.\n\n* Today I bought a straddle on Johnson &amp;  Johnson (JNJ).\n* I bought 10 calls of JNJ with a 127 strike for $3.48.\n* I bought 10 puts of JNJ with a 127 strike for $3.22.\n* Straddle expires 6 September.\n* My total cost for these was $6.7 ($6,700).\n\nAt 4pm eastern the Judge in Oklahoma ruled against JNJ but levied a very small fine.  The stock surged to $134 in after hours trading but started to fade back down.  I was worried I would miss profit so I tried to offset delta and shorted 600 shares at $132.  Shares are now $130.\n\nThese have some ugly theta decay so I want to get out of this tomorrow. This was really an experiment but I think tomorrow I will end up getting hosed.\n\nAgain, I am not an options pro by any means.  I'm wondering if anyone has any suggestions on how to manage this trade and get out at least in the green?\n\nThanks for looking at this. \n\nSincerely,\n\nChris", "created_utc": 1566856054, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cvuox2/jnj_straddle_exit_strategy_help/", "is_self": true}
