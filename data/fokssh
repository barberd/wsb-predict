The wavy blue and gray lines that follow the movement of the candlesticks are blue) [moving average](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/movingaverage.asp), and gray) [Bollinger Bands](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bollingerbands.asp). These both indicate general pricing trends. The red horizontal lines are called [fibonacci retracements](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/fibonacciretracement.asp). These are super easy to use, and tend to indicate areas of support or resistance. These do not indicate which direction a stock is going to go, just where the support and resistance will likely be. \n\nBelow that is volume, you can see that the volume was higher during normal trading hours, especially at the beginning and end of the day.\n\nNext we have [RSI](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp) (relative strength index). SOMETIMES, this can indicate when a stock is about to reverse direction, though it's not 100% accurate, and will fuck you up if you rely on it too much. But notice how when the RSI crosses the top line, the candlesticks tend to start going down, and when it crosses the bottom line, the prices tend to go up.\n\nBelow that is [MACD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MACD), or Moving Average Convergence Divergence, which can be used to help confirm decisions you've made (after the fact).\n\nAll of these come with sensible defaults and can be customized to your personal liking. \n\nI'm not an expert, just trying to give a hand up to new tards who could use some TA.\n\nSPY 220p 4/8  \nSPY 280c 4/17  \nBAC 14p 4/17", "created_utc": 1585113762.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fokssh/tech_anal_shhhh_just_let_it_happen/", "is_self": true}
