I beat the S&amp;P easily. I realized the market is even more fucking retarded than I thought it was before I got into it. You people introduced me to options. I needed fast money for a situation in my life I was terrified about and as I learned more about how options worked I decided to dive into them, learn them fully, and get into them. I made gains on my first options trade like everyone does, then lost on my second trade but was still ahead on options trading overall, and stayed that way for a little while, making gains and losses and gains and losses with my little penny options trades but overall mostly staying in the green. Then I went in the red and stayed there. This caused a psychological change and I suddenly became incapable of making money on the stock market, let alone beating the S&amp;P. \n\nIf I had just stuck with my buy-and-hold slow-money strategy, I'd be at huge gains right now, but I was too scared over shit in my life I'm not gonna go into. I shouldn't have been so scared, it turned out OK, but I just want it to be clear I wasn't being greedy for greed's sake, there were serious fears going on making me give up what was working and get so addicted to trying to make something happen faster that I just kept burning my gains. \n\nEventually, I accidentally lost ALL of my gains, my Robinhood account was back to the amount I had put into it, about $420. I decided to start being more cautious and go back to not making options trades bigger than my stock wins. This meant I couldn't afford to trade options for a while since options are expensive and gains from $420 on the stock market are minimal.\n\n**Chapter 2: Retard** \n\nI failed to stick to it and at some point thought it was a good idea to make some options trade again and lost more money, bringing me not only into the red on my all-time options trading, but deep into the red on my entire Robinhood account overall. The gains I had made with regular equities trading over the past few months were gone not only gone, but replaced with losses. So then for a while I was kinda just in a panic of like, fuck it, if I can't somehow make a bunch of money on a big bet I'm gonna be unable to resolve this situation in my life and I'm gonna fuckin die, I might as well just start trading as hard as I can until I save my account, there's no way I'll lose it all, I'm smart and my life is on the line, I won't get beat by the fuckin retard market if I go all-out. \n\nSpoiler: I did not lose it all. I'm not literally retarded, not that it would even be that retarded to lose $420 which is pocket change to a lot of you, but it is a lot of money to me so I did eventually decide I wanted to at least keep a fraction of it and not blow it all on this panic. You thought I did not lose it all because I made money? No. I kept losing until I decided to stop losing. I did not manage to start winning yet.\n\nAnyway, I burned through almost half the money left in the account, always taking a step forward and two steps back. I was starting to become a good occasional options trader, like at this point I would have a very very good rate of average returns on trades if I only traded options occasionally, but I didn't only trade occasionally, instead I only *got into trading* occasionally, meaning I'd go a long time not trading, get a good trade opportunity, make the trade, be like \"I am a god and the market is retarded and there are options gains to be made like this every day so I might as well find the option that's gonna double this money again tomorrow instead of waiting weeks for another opportunity to come to me like a chump.\" Didn't really tend to double my money again tomorrow with that thought process. \n\nI took like a year off from trading. \n\n**Chapter 3: Not Even My Fault Anymore I Was Getting Good By This Point I Swear To God**\n\nAfter a long time off trading, I felt like I was ready to trade again and stop panicking and falling into psychological traps making losses.\n\nYet what you're about to hear is more of me falling into psychological traps and making losses just like before. \n\nYet I was right. I was ready. I had come a long way. There's something different about the panic and FOMO I had in this chapter. It was unavoidable. \n\nI deposited $100 fresh, clean dollars into my Robinhood account so I could keep the rest of the account tied up in stocks it was already tied up in. Then I continued waiting for a chance to come along where I had a good use for that $100.\n\nThen, a few months later, coronavirus was getting into a few thousand confirmed cases in China and everyone was pretending it was no big deal and I felt like I had finally encountered one of those chances where I knew what the market was about to do better than multi-billion-dollar investing firms. I was right, as I usually am since most people, even highly educated specialized people, are fucking retarded and capable of failing to comprehend something as simple as the difference between this outbreak and others. \n\nI bought a Delta Airlines put when Delta was already down pretty hard for the day, because they were down less than the other airlines and I knew that would correct the next day. It was the first day where the market was reacting to coronavirus at all, and I knew it was an underreaction in the long run, though it might also be temporary in the short term. I was worried Delta might gap up the next day, given that understanding that this market reaction might be temporary, but I knew even if they gapped up they'd go back down because more bad news would come out, this was a period of time where the news was continuously getting exponentially worse for like a week or two. They gapped up by the next day, and kept going up, but I didn't worry about it because I knew for a fact they would go back down and close well below where they were at the day before. \n\nThey finally started going back down, and while I was watching the screen eagerly awaiting my chance to submit a sell order, trying to guess where the peak would be to start figuring out where to set my price limit, Robinhood sold it for like a 20% loss. Half an hour later, they hit my strike price, then in the little while left before the market closed they just kept going, and I would have had so much gain.\n\nBut instead, I was losing money and losing more money, because that whole time towards the end where the market was plummeting and Delta was going down while I made no money off it, I had such panic and FOMO that I rotated blindly into other options. At one point I was holding SPY calls and puts at the same time for no strong strategic reason. And I swear to god I was doing that as a good trader. The holdings I had at market close weren't retarded. They were kinda decent for such a panic. Most of them hit their strike prices before their expirations.\n\nThe reason I say this happened while I'm actually good, while the others happened because I was inexperienced, is that I knew what I was doing, and no amount of experience would have saved me. I literally knew exactly what I was doing. I was having fear of missing out, panicking, trading retardedly, frantically rotating my meager funds from one surefire trade that had gotten stolen from me to a bunch of questionable trades that I just had to hope I was right about. I did this because I wasn't willing to let that day be a loss for me after I had seen everything coming, done everything right, known Delta might gap up but would go back down, known to be watching Delta at the right time to see my option's value peak and submit my sell order, never got distracted, just got robbed. I felt better about the idea of putting all this money at risk than I did about just accepting the loss, because I couldn't just accept the loss, because I had been sitting on this $100 for months promising myself I would never lose any of it, only make money on it, that I wouldn't make mistakes anymore and I'd trade right from now on, only trade when I had a good opportunity, and I successfully stuck to that rule this time, and my bet was good and all that, and still, after all that, a big chunk of the money was gone. There is no amount of experience or knowledge or skill that would have made me feel differently about it. Panic trading based on dumbass FOMO was what I was doing because it was my only option for the goals I had in that moment. \n\nAnd there had been previous times where the dumb shit I did was with full knowledge. And yeah, I also say that means I was more skilled than I seemed at the time, if you looked at my all-time trades and assumed I didn't know what I was doing I'd look a lot more retarded than if you understood all the times I knew *exactly* what I was doing, down to the exact psychological problems causing me to fall for the trap, and still did it just because the situation I was in made it the best option. At least, under the assumption that my life depended on getting a lot more money really quickly. \n\nSo, that Friday evening, I had some options holdings that seemed like they should win (and did come close to winning). My plan was to take the gains and put them in puts, and if this dip turned out to be temporary and I lost everything on the puts, keep depositing money to stay in puts until Coronavirus crashed the market, then keep rolling the gains from that into more puts until the market bottomed out. Ez pz. Would finally have my situation resolved with all the money needed, unfortunately due to something as dark as a pandemic but at least I could also use the money to prepare for it. \n\nAnyway yeah, I lost almost the whole hundred that same week because I could not accept having had that chunk of it stolen by Robinhood.\n\nStill, it was not yet time to give up. As terrified as I had been of losing that $100 after months of promising myself I would never lose it, I had been forced near the end to prepare for the possibility that I might have lost it and might have had to keep depositing money to stay in puts until the crash even if it cost a lot along the way. This had been a horrible cherry on top of a cake of horrible luck, but as I've explained, I knew I was getting good at this point and what happened was basically just bad timing and FOMO. I could try again, and this time I would just refuse to let FOMO get to me, because that's what it kept boiling down to every time the whole time. Every psychological trap I fell into was based on FOMO. Every retarded thing I did was because I had such intense fear of failure. At this point I had to basically accept that failure was not only a possibility but an actual outcome that kept happening and it couldn't stop happening unless I let it be possible. If I would start letting myself accept failures instead of panicking trying to correct them then this couldn't happen to me again; Robinhood could rob me on a trade again but it wouldn't trick me into burning up whatever remained, it would just let me take whatever remained, wait a few days, and make way more money than I lost because I knew the crash was coming and it had way more gain in store than I had in money to lose. \n\nSo, I made a deposit to my Robinhood account again.\n\n**And what did those fuckers do??** They said it would take 2-5 days for the deposit to come through, then they took longer than 5 days - I'm pretty sure longer than 5 business days, unless I missed some Jewish holiday or something - and I didn't know this happened so I just thought I surprisingly had more money on my card than I realized, so I spent the money after more than 5 days and when they finally tried their deposit it didn't go through, so they charged me $9 on their end and my credit union charged me like $80. I resolved the credit union charge with a 2 minute phone call because my credit union is awesome, but I still mention it because not everyone would be so lucky and it would be a huge insult to injury on top of the $9 Robinhood bullshit charge if I hadn't been so lucky. \n\nAt this point, RH can go fuck themselves, I'm at negative buying power on their brokerage and I just won't be using it anymore. I'll sell all my holdings bit by bit over time and then close the account. I'll start trading options again when I save up a starter seed again and find a better brokerage to put it in. I suspect with that fresh start I'll finally do well. \n\nConclusion. I think I am now a good options trader, with absolutely no proof of that and nothing to show for it. I think that's the point I've been at since a little while before I deposited that final $100. I think the mistakes I described making in the first two chapters were nearly unavoidable but not quite. I think the mistakes I make in chapter three were *actually* unavoidable. I mean, if you looked at a billion timelines, you'd probably see a few where I never got into options trading, or where I quickly realized I shouldn't be cocky with options trading and should only do it when I have good smart opportunities to. The fact that I failed in this timeline and probably most of those billion timelines is because I wasn't skilled enough yet to take the best course, not because the best course was totally impossible to see. But even if you look at a hundred billion timelines, you will not see one where I was able to handle the following events any better than you're about to hear. It's not that I wasn't skilled enough to take the best course, it's that the best course was totally impossible to see. \n\nHowever, skill doesn't matter for me. My intelligence makes it so I can beat the market without any skill, and my FOMO makes it so I can't beat the market no matter how skilled I get. Even if I'm a good options trader, I'm a loser so far, and I might keep being a loser due to FOMO. Hopefully I won't. Hopefully from now on I will stick. to. the. fucking. rule. of only trading on occasions when I have a good smart opportunity to do so. If I want to be such a god trader I can find the good opportunities every day, I have to let that happen *slowly* over time. Future me, please, don't lose sight of this next time a big number on your brokerage screen fucks with your head. \n\n#TL;DR - I'm fucking retarded, but something was always off about how I'm way more retarded than I should be, eventually I stopped being retarded and figured out what was off the whole time was FOMO, just felt like sharing and I guess the moral is for the love of God don't let FOMO be an overwhelming feeling for you as a trader or you're gonna be luck's BITCH\n\nSide note: I also have another brokerage account where I've never had losses and have had more stable performance than the S&amp;P, because my other brokerage doesn't allow options trading -_- at least I'm not a loser among the slow-snoring boomers that trade equities", "created_utc": 1582905829, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fawvy5/my_failure_story_directors_cut_or_how_i_learned/", "is_self": true}
