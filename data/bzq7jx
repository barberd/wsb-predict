{"id": "bzq7jx", "title": "My thoughts on BYND post yesterday's fall", "selftext": "Upfront disclaimer: I'm long BYND. Now on yesterday's crash and why I'm still long / didn't sell: \n\n* TLRY had multiple &gt;10% one-day crashes before it peaked at over $200 on 19-Sept. Then it halved over the next few trading days but then shot up 65%. Reason I make this analogy is because I also view BYND as TLYR 2.0 with the added benefit that it's the only pure-play on a very hot new theme (fake meat) vs. TLRY when it was one of many stocks in a very hot new theme (marijuana).\n* BYND also has the added benefit of free publicity from celebrities &amp; influencers (who have a vested interest to promote because they're owners too) + from the vegan community especially considering that founder Ethan Brown is vegan and their products are GMO and soy free (unlike Impossible Foods).\n* I also don't think the short squeeze has happened yet because short interest remained at the \\~50% level during the 2 days where it popped (Fri and Mon). Why? One explanation is that if you take a granular look at the short interest data, most of the shorts were done at the $70-80 level. So perhaps they're waiting to get closer to this level to break-even / reduce their loss before realising it. But that's ANOTHER \\~40% fall on top of yesterday's fall just to break-even yet alone recoup the crazy amount they've been paying in borrow fees + make any profit.\n* But we're not going to get to that $70-80 level. Why? Here are the broker price targets in descending order: $126 (Bernstein) / $125 (CS) / $121 (JPM) / $105 (Jefferies) / $101 (BAML) / $91 (Consumer Edge - have no idea who they are) / $76 (GS). If BYND hits $100, then you have 3 analysts with &gt;20% upside who'll upgrade it. If BYND fell 25% yesterday because of one analyst downgrade, how do you think it'll react to if 3 analysts upgraded?\n* Summary from all this: most of those who shorted will never make a profit. Eventually they'll have to throw in the towel because of how much they're bleeding on a daily basis in borrow fees.\n* In the meantime, I think there's huge scope for positive news-flow over the next 1-2 months that can cause a pop in the stock price. Announcing additional trials with QSRs (quick-service restaurants), existing trials going into full partnerships (e.g. Tim Hortons - this got announced this morning) and once again mgmt's conservative 140% YoY increase in 2019 revenue only includes post-trial partnerships (i.e. Tim Hortons is now additional upside), entering new markets (e.g. Asia which on the conference call mgmt said they want to aggressively enter), expanding their footprint in Europe (where rival Impossible Food is struggling to access because of their GMO product which the EU is very anal about), and so on. And of course, the mother of all announcements: a trial with McDonalds. I still expect this to happen in the near-term.\n* Summary: I still think the stock has room to run over the next few months. I'm personally waiting for the above catalysts to happen (new QSR trials, McDonalds announcement, short-squeeze) before thinking of trimming / exiting. I plan to exit starting in October either way because at the end of October is when the IPO 180-day lock-up ends (lots of insider selling from VCs and other early investors who want to monetise their investment + additional supply of shares makes it easier to short).\n* Disclaimer: this is just my thinking of how things can play out and I can be completely wrong. This is not investment advice whatsoever and invest at your own risk.\n* The Tim Horton's announcement today in case you missed it:  [https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/beyond-meat-r-breakfast-sandwiches-are-now-available-at-tim-hortons-r-restaurants-across-canada-827519589.html](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/beyond-meat-r-breakfast-sandwiches-are-now-available-at-tim-hortons-r-restaurants-across-canada-827519589.html)", "created_utc": 1560340044, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bzq7jx/my_thoughts_on_bynd_post_yesterdays_fall/", "is_self": true}
