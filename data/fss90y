{"id": "fss90y", "title": "Let's play with matches", "selftext": "Greetings fellow cucks and autists. I\u2019m here today to share some autism distilled into its weaponized form using the book of matches that /u/fuzzyblankeet so considerately (or negligently) left out for us to play with.\n\nBefore you go any further, you should understand that /u/krusteeblanket is **not** an SEC lawyer, and has less than a complete high school education. This is not investment advice; my advice is that you invest in something nice for your wife to wear for her boyfriend and quit throwing away your money trying to guess what jnug and spy will do the next day.\n\nWithout further ado, let\u2019s talk about how to pick the bones of the soon-to-be roadkill that is Fiesta Restaurant Group (FRGI).\n\nOkay, a little more ado\u2026 before we start, you should read the [10-K](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1534992/000153499220000019/frgi-2019q410k.htm) so that you can do this shit yourselves instead of relying on janitors such as yours truly:\n\n**1.** **The beer flu is bad for restaurants, the FED is bad for puts. No shit. Everyone knows.**\n\nSo you are probably asking yourself, what should I do for those sweet, sweet tendies? Why not some puts? Let\u2019s consider what happens when a business goes under [but you have puts.](https://www.optionsanimal.com/what-happens-value-option-when-company-declares-bankruptcy/)\n\nShort story shorter, you profit, and someone else holds the bag. Wouldn\u2019t that be nice for once?\n\nKeep that in mind.\n\nNow, our next question\u2026. What businesses might be disproportionately affected by this whole bat munching thing? Restaurants! Good answer turds. Not all restaurants are created equal though. Some are drowning in cash and good credit. Others, not so much. On top of that, this bail out is designed to help our huge corporate overlords, and small businesses will keep having their American dreams cucked. Don\u2019t buy puts on BK (QSR). They have tons of debt, but they aren\u2019t going anywhere, so it\u2019s just like buying a lotto ticket.\n\nSome of you autists have been banging your head against the walls wondering why certain stocks keep climbing when as all the boomers and sick people are dying off. \n\n[It\u2019s because this virus and this bailout are going to suffocate big business\u2019 mom-and-pop (and small cap) competition, not (most) big boys.](https://www.forexlive.com/news/!/the-rise-in-the-sp-500-isnt-what-you-think-it-is-20200331)\n\nYeah it\u2019s sad and all, but this is capitalism and that means that the silver lining is always a potential profit opportunity. Enter FRGI. I\u2019ll give you a hint up front, their credit sucks and they aren\u2019t getting a bail out.\n\n**2.** **RTF10-K (Read the F\u2026 10-K)**\n\nIf you were a sports gambler, you\u2019d probably make it your business to know who you were betting for and against. As our dear dad Fuzzy pointed out, the SEC makes it super easy for us. Read it. I\u2019ll wait.\n\nNow that you\u2019ve done that, you\u2019ve used your big brain and determined the following:\n\n\u00b7 They operate in Texas and Florida (hint: Florida is fuk)\n\n\u00b7 They have two chains \u2013 Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana, have you heard of them? No?\n\n\u00b7 About half their sales in 2019 occurred in the drivethrough\n\nIn the risks they list for their business they include:\n\n\u00b7 ***If a significant disruption in service or supply by any of our suppliers or distributors were to occur, it could create disruptions in the operations of our restaurants, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\u201d***\n\n\u00b7 ***\u201cEconomic downturns may adversely impact consumer spending patterns.\u201d***\n\n\u00b7 ***\u201cOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition.\u201d***\n\n\u00b7 ***Despite current indebtedness levels and restrictive covenants, we may still be able to incur more debt or make certain restricted payments, which could further exacerbate the risks described above.***\n\nSo, what happens when you have a lot of debt, and way less customers than your thought? What happens you\u2019re your debt is such that you have to put in your 10-K that you probably can\u2019t take on more debt, but if you did it would be an even greater risk\u2026 Oh, I forgot to mention, you also have leases you are obligated to pay in addition to your debt. Also, read that last bullet point above one more time.\n\n\u00b7 ***We are subject to all of the risks associated with leasing property subject to long-term non-cancelable leases.***\n\nThat\u2019s right \u2013 they have 306 restaurants, 294 of which are leased. These leases are typically **35 to 45 years**. Wow. They can probably sublet if things get bad. Not like commercial real estate is gonna be rough right now.\n\n**3.** **Let\u2019s get into the financials**\n\nThere is a whole bunch of negative stuff I\u2019m going to gloss over since the stock has already taken several hits. If you are interested it\u2019s all in the\u2026 you guessed it\u2026 10-K! There is a new 8-K that pulls their earnings too for all your nerds out there. Go back and read the 10k. I know you lied about reading it earlier. If you have questions ask /u/fuzzyblankeet. I think he costs 1.5k an hour, but he\u2019s a good dad and he might not charge you. Maybe you can mow his lawn instead.\n\nSo... By their financials, I mean debt and liabilities \u2013\n\nWithin the year they need to pay 49,335,000.\n\nWithin the next 3 years they need to pay an additional 166,222,000.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t read fuzzy\u2019s posts yet shame on you. Go do it now. And buy him 6 beers. And a lap dance.\n\nNow that you\u2019ve read them, you are familiar with the shady concept of EBITDA. Whenever companies use it, they have to state upfront that it is a way of calculating that does not conform to \u201cgenerally accepted accounting practices\u201d. That is corporate-speak for \u201cshady\u201d.\n\nTheir EBITDA in 2019 was 58,000,000.\n\n**4.** **Big brain time**\n\nThere are better ways to do this analysis, but like I said, I\u2019m just a janitor. If you could afford an SEC lawyer, you wouldn\u2019t be using RH and shitposting on WSB. Not saying doing it the right way would be wasted on you, but I\u2019ve got other stuff I\u2019ve gotta mop tonight.\n\nSince EBITDA is the weird hot dog meat of finance, let\u2019s look at sales in 2019. 658,263,000. Not bad. Yet they reported (84,386) for income. () means it\u2019s negative. They made negative money. Told you EBITDA was shady. To see how they might be doing now, let\u2019s hypothetically say that they only keep their drive-thru sales because of the beer flu. That\u2019s like 330,000,000. Now let\u2019s say they don\u2019t pay half their workers. That takes their operating expenses down from 732,088,000 to about 640,000,000.\n\n330,000,000 - 640,000,000 = (310,000,000)\u2026 uh oh. That\u2019s worse than their EBITDA. They say that their net cash in 2019 was like 65,000,000\u2026 not like they need to use that for payroll or food or cups or anything\u2026 It\u2019s not like they have all that debt to pay.\n\nRemember, this is a quick and nasty estimation and should not be interpreted as anything but. They surely have other ways to cut costs.\n\n**5.** **So, they are gonna need more debt to pay their debt.**\n\nLooks like before this beerflu kicked off, they had about 71.3 million left on their credit line (150 mil). Remember how much their contractual obligations were this next year, and then the 3 years thereafter. Ever hear of a term called a \u201cdebt wall\u201d?\n\nIf you look at their [credit agreement,](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1534992/000119380517003547/e617524_ex10-1.htm) you\u2019ll see that they are charged more when their leverage goes up. You\u2019ll also see that their leverage is restricted to a maximum of 4.5 times their EBIDTA (based on a complicated formula in the credit agreement). You\u2019ll also see that they are not allowed to incur any debt with anyone else.\n\nRemember negative covenants? Buckle up.\n\n**6.** **Putting it all together.**\n\nIf debt goes up and EBITDA goes down with sales, the leverage ratio goes up. How high? It depends. If they don\u2019t even have enough cash to service their debt this year without dipping into credit, what happens next? Long story short, it is not good, and there aren\u2019t a whole lot of good options left, thanks to the negative covenants. RIP \u2013 (**F) RGI**\n\nSince this is janitorial services, I\u2019ll leave it here. Remember this is all probably garbage since /u/krusteeblanket is just the nasty thing under your bed that you hope your mom never finds, basically the opposite of fuzzyblankeet, who is expensive and actually keeps your mom warm at night. Maybe he\u2019ll jump in and help unfuk this before you all lose your money. Maybe not, he probably has hot chicks to bang and companies to kill.\n\nBut wait, the options chain probably sucks right now\u2026 and this might be a longish play\u2026 if only there were a way that you could sell an OTM call and buy a further OTM call to take other peoples sweet, sweet tendies as premium\u2026 repeatedly\u2026 until this ship sinks\u2026\n\nAgain, this is all hypothetical. I don\u2019t have any positions in FRGI, I just like playing with matches. All credit goes to /u/fuzzyblankeet, all blame when something bad happens goes on yourself.\n\n**Tl:dr \u2013 strangle on onion futures, pick any ticker.**", "created_utc": 1585713762.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fss90y/lets_play_with_matches/", "is_self": true}
