{"id": "gddgr1", "title": "Is ARE a target to short?", "selftext": "Most tenants of ARE are those companies which would function as normal while allowing employees to work from home. There will be definitely some loss of tenants even a small percentage of them discover that WFH is as efficient as working in the office. Or the tenants may delay signing new leases.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/080l4x1knrw41.png?width=1266&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd202ca84a567215bd7785c7f2122c4fc7fd9efd\n\ncomparing 3/2019 to 3/2020, a 2 % reduction in \"Occupancy of operating properties -North America\", result in half year in weighted average remaining lease. The commercial lease usually are 10-20 years. If the loss of occupancy is due to not renewing lease or signing new lease with less term, the total percentage loss in weighted lease term shall  be much smaller. So the only reason is that they have new spaces unoccupied. The RSF increase from 25.3Million sqft to 30.9 sqft. so the not rented spaces , which will bring extra burden down the road.\n\nthe average rent is 51 dollar per sqft, times total RSF and occupancy rate, divde by 4 to get income of each quarter,  which will give them over $51\\*30.9Million sqft \\* 95% =1.3 billion a year. Seems consistent with other numbers presented.\n\nAt 3/2019 the stock is at 142, now it is at 150, with 20% increased space and 8% reduction in weighted lease term. the rate increase on existing tenants is 46%. Are they trying to present better financials by raising rent on existing tenants? because they have trouble to secure new tenants?\n\nPlease help me with the points that I missed.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o9tuf9tsjrw41.png?width=1285&format=png&auto=webp&s=130397eb317495ae89b7d77ecd1d1c8729feac46", "created_utc": 1588605543.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gddgr1/is_are_a_target_to_short/", "is_self": true}
