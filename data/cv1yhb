Consumer is very strong. Women have a ton of discretionary income these days.....  that's part of why you saw Target shoot up 20% on earnings. \n\nBURL is another consumer play, but should be considered 2nd tier to DLTR and ULTA.\n\nThursday will buck the trend and will be a green green day. \n\nYes DD should be this simple.

You just need a general idea of macro and micro fundamentals and investor sentiment.", "created_utc": 1566695891, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cv1yhb/heres_two_earnings_plays_for_next_thursday_dd/", "is_self": true}
