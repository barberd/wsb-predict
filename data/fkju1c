Anyway, this place is run by a bunch of old fucks who all got rich when doctors got paid more than programmers and didn\u2019t have six figure debt and malpractice was kind of like drunk driving back then, in that it wasn\u2019t super legal and cool, but no one really gave a shit. \n\nSo this place employs about 80 docs, and all the younger ones who know how to use a fucking smart phone without getting a migraine or needing a nap have been asking to implement telemedicine for at least 2-3 years, and of course management never does shit. But that all changed with beerflu. \n\nNow that patients are refusing to sit in the waiting rooms to hand us money, and we\u2019re running out of masks and gloves, we have finally decided to implement telemedicine as of this week. What\u2019s more, Trump decided today that we can get paid for it even though we aren\u2019t in a rural area. Medicare announced this via email this evening. This was the previous excuse management had been using, and now it\u2019s gone. See below.\n\nhttps://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/president-trump-expands-telehealth-benefits-medicare-beneficiaries-during-covid-19-outbreak\n\n\nNow if you actually click and read that link (lol), you\u2019ll see that this is temporary. Doesn\u2019t fucking matter. Every clinic, hospital, and doctor in the country is going to be looking to keep revenue running over the next few months without getting infected. You think once we buy those cameras and train our staff and shell out for software licenses and convince patients its equivalent to a normal visit and enjoy the convenience of seeing more people more easily that we\u2019re going to shutter that and go back? \n\nTL;DR: TDOC calls for at least June, buy on a red day (not today, dumbass)", "created_utc": 1584506353.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkju1c/boomers_finally_coming_around_on_telemedicine/", "is_self": true}
