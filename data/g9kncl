It was a dream of oil flowing all over the ground and into the ocean. Tankers and trucks full of oil weighing them down with nowhere to go. Nowhere left to keep it all. Nowhere. Then it hit me.\n\n\nI nearly kicked my wife's boyfriend off the bed when I shot up. Space. Goddamnit space. Where else is there space to keep the oil but fucking space!?! Listen to me, they are paying Elon Musk right now to stick millions of barrels of oil onto onto his recycle rockets and he's just shooting the shit out there. Wanna say that's not cost effective? Oil. Is. Less. Than. Free.\n\n\nStorage? It's fucking space. It's stored in space. You can tie a string to a million 2 liter coke bottles filled with oil and as long as the bottles come down when and where you tell them  then it's literally free oil space. The actual name of the place is space. If my calculations are correct he should have approximately an amount equal Alaska floating over our heads.\n\n\nBut baby, this is Elon we are talking about here. He isn't going to stop there. He's working on a gasoline engine Tesla model 12 equipped with the gas nozzle on the roof. You need gas? You push a button on an app and that shit falls out of the sky. The big 3 go under because how the fuck do you compete with gas falling into your car. \n\nTSLA 1000c 05/01", "created_utc": 1588068800.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9kncl/tsla_genius_why_elon_is_going_to_be_the_richest/", "is_self": true}
