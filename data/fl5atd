{"id": "fl5atd", "title": "[DD] Liquidity Crisis is going to fucking melt the markets.", "selftext": "TL;DR: TQQQ ~~5~~ 6/19 25p but wait till the Thursday short squeeze.\nEveryone is running for cash, so the folks buying the stocks when you try to sell (MMs) are fucking running our of money. \n\nSo the fed decided to spin up the money printer, and lower rates to 0 and they decided to allow equities to be used as collateral. That's not a fucking handout, that's a loan. And a shitty one at that. \n\nJPMorgan can fucking borrow free money in exchange for some shitty stocks that are in free fall. They can use that money for whatever they want. Really, they are just using it to meet their reserve requirements. So they are just fucking sitting on it. Or buying bonds.\n\nBut we're literally printing money just so theres enough of it so that the banks don't collapse under the weight of the reserve requirements. \n\nNow what the fuck do you think happens when folks start drawing down savings and checking from the massive unemployment spike that just happened? Reserves go down. The shit assets Morgan bought need to be collateralize just so the bank can pay Cleatus the $6.50 that was left in his checking account after his binger celebrating trumps $1000 handout. (Side note: Its going to be more like $850, and it isn't tax free so more like $650, and it won't arrive for another 2 months). \n\nSo what happens when you you need to cover expenses but you ran out of cash? You start buying Dollars with assets. But dollars are much scarcer than assets, so you end up having to sell more than you initially wanted just to get the dollars you need to cover your ass. \n\nAnd now we get to the stock market, Who the fuck wants these shitty nasdaq companies, Small caps, and non-dividend paying stocks that are going to eat shit now that mom and pop shops are dead. Its going to be a bloodbath as investors start to exit their position, and theres no one buying because the liquidity has dried up. \n\nI'll post positions when I take them Thursday.\n\nAlso I'll take a #6 with a diet coke.", "created_utc": 1584599102.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fl5atd/dd_liquidity_crisis_is_going_to_fucking_melt_the/", "is_self": true}
