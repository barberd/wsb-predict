{"id": "fd86yh", "title": "Supply shock vs Small Cap ETF (3x inverse small cap etf, $TZA)", "selftext": "$TZA is an inverse small cap ETF. It tracks the Russell 2000 index. It holds lots of healthcare (which might be bad if some underlyings moon for retarded reasons; i haven't checked), industrial, utilities\n\nWhy not $SQQQ you ask? \n\nSimple: \n\n- do $SQQQ too, but add $TZA for some 'diversification'\n- high debt, more vulnerable to supply shock, higher risk of going belly up in the next few months\n- $QQQ likely will rally harder because of tech, which will hurt when holding the inverse\n- maybe a bit more but that's it really\n\nWanted to get this out to you all before i collapse for the night so excuse the lack of meme and DD girthyness \n\nI'm only long stock on a relatively small position in $TZA since last week along with $SQQQ so things are quite peachy. However I have not checked its option chain so not sure about its liquidity. I know, blow me.\n\nHope this inspires others and spark some erudite discussion.
