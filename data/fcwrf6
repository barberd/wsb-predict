She sent out this email today to a few of her concerned friends and CC'd me:\n\n\n\"Dr. Paul Biddinger is a professor of disaster medicine at Harvard, and is responsible for medical disaster planning and response for the city of Boston - we worked together a lot in the 911-Katrina years. Paul was interviewed on the news last night saying that covid19 could be a grave public health threat. I know he is not alarmist, and I trust him to tell the truth (unlike the CDC, which has been muzzled by Trump).  I sent him a quick email this morning. His sense is that we may all be practicing 'social distancing' in the April/May time period.  He can't predict if the epidemic 'wave' will have passed by June.\n\nI would not be surprised to see some mandatory measures such as closing schools and college dorms, and canceling large gatherings (concerts, sporting events).\n\nThe real unknown is how quickly the epidemic wave will hit.  If many people who work in the service infrastructure (supermarket employees, truck drivers, etc.) are too sick to work, all at once, there could be some disruptions and shortages (and hospitals will be overwhelmed - like in a really bad flu year). If the epidemic wave is slow, we may all be able to keep up without too much disruption.  We should have a better sense of this in the next couple of weeks.\"\n\nWhen I asked what made her change her mind, \"This expert I trust has a lot of access to early data that you and I don't, and he's saying it's significantly scarier than I first thought.\"\n\n\nTLDR; sToNKs aLwAyS gO uP", "created_utc": 1583251651, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcwrf6/close_associate_has_worked_in_public_health/", "is_self": true}
