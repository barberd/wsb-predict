The best flavor will win in the long run and BYND ain't it, at least not this version.\n\nI went to whole foods to try this vegan super meat and the taste doesn't live up to it's promise, at least for me. But here's the kicker. \n\nThere were several other fake meat brands for sale, so I tried one of them. [Gardein meatless sliders.](https://products.wholefoodsmarket.com/product/gardein-the-ultimate-beefless-sliders-09113d)\n\nFor me, these things tasted far closer to meat than beyond burgers. They don't \"bleed\" but honestly who gives a fuck about that.\n\nGardein is owned by Pinnacle Foods which is owned by Conagra Brands (ticker is $CAG) so long $CAG I guess?\n\nI've also heard that the impossible burger taste better than the beyond burger and after having tasted the beyond burger I'm inclined to believe those anecdotes.\n\nLet me know if you've tried the Gardein meat or any other fake meat.", "created_utc": 1558888926, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bta23v/as_if_you_needed_another_reason_to_short_bynd/", "is_self": true}
