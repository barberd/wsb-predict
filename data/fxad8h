Or maybe the days where you watched jartek screw your wife.\n\nThere will be no hate in this meeting, no fear of being made fun of because your shitty yolo puts are now garbage. It will be an open environment to speak your mind.\n\nIf this makes your tendies tickle, leave a comment about how gay Jartek is and you will get a special invite to a private yacht purchased by all the tears that have been shed from r/stocks and r/options because of you autists. For the rest of you cocksuckers, you all need a real psychologist to fix your stonk addiction.", "created_utc": 1586365734.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxad8h/a_lot_of_shit_went_down_some_of_you_are_suffering/", "is_self": true}
