{"id": "f17vm8", "title": "DD: Bilibili ($BILI)", "selftext": "Bilibili is a Chinese video sharing website similar to Nico Nico Douga and related sites. The content is mostly anime and game stuff. In the wake of the recent Coronavirus scare, most Chinese stocks have gone down, however BILI has risen 14% likely to around $25 a share. The reasoning for this may be that it's easy to share news about the coronavirus on its platform, thus increasing ad revenue. Also in general Chinese internet stocks may be more immune to the economic changes associated with a virus, which would affect sectors like manufacturing more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow let's get this straight. I understand nothing about the fundamentals of this company and am too lazy to look it up. However, I am a huge weeb and I learned recently that Bilibili's name is actually derived from \"Biri - biri\" the nickname of Misaka Mikoto protagonist of the action sci-fi series A Certain Scientific Railgun. She is an esper with the powerful ability to control electromagnetic forces, including manifesting lightning at will hence \"biribiri\" since this is what Japanese people think lightning sounds like. Now Misaka just happens to be mai waifu so already I am captivated by this company that took its namesake from best girl herself. For that reason alone I might pick up the stock. But it doesn't end there! Apparently Bilibili also celebrates Misaka's birthday every year on May 2 on its front page, and even designs its user tokens after Misaka's signature move the Railgun. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr: Long BILI because Misaka Mikoto is mai waifu", "created_utc": 1581250401, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f17vm8/dd_bilibili_bili/", "is_self": true}
