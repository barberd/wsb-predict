{"id": "daarjc", "title": "My lack of essential stonks knowledge", "selftext": "I've been a retard for about two months now, and since joining this amazing sub, I have become heavily addicted to staring at my Robinhood app hoping that it makes me money. \n\nI don't know how any of this shit works; I don't know what stocks do, I don't know what the S&amp;P is, what an IPO is outside of what Jordan Belfort taught me. I don't know what futures are, what the IV crush is, or what the fuck margin is. I don't know what leverage is, or a motherfucking cap-weighted index. \n\nThe furthest expiration I fuck with is one week max, and I use all my day trades as soon as they're available. I only trade SPY, GPRO, and GME options or Iron Condors on shit that has dropped significantly. Don't ask me fucking why because I do not know. \n\nI started with $100 a month because I'm fucking poor and right now I'm at $331. Up $231 this month over 27 trades. I refuse to learn other shit about stocks that might help me and I only watch YouTube to learn about options. I get all my DD from the daily discussion threads on this sub. \n\nThis shit is easy and all you guys are amazing. Thanks for finally giving me hope.", "created_utc": 1569640655, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/daarjc/my_lack_of_essential_stonks_knowledge/", "is_self": true}
