No, not the new Air Fryer everyone can't seem to stop talking about... no no, not the new Apple Watch. Nope, sorry, it's not one of the best devices made this side of 2010 (A Roku). This package consists of $250,000 USD that will be promptly shuttered into an options trading account. I am considering one of the two options (please, no puns, thank you):\n\n\\- $200,000 in SPY DEC 2020 330 Call options, use the remaining $50,000 to sell VIX puts (or some VIX/UVXY/VXXB instrument) along the way as a built in insurance/hedging mechanism.\n\n\\- $200,000 in SPY JAN 2021 350 Calll options, use the remaining $50,000 to buy VIX calls (or some VIX/UVXY/VXXB instrument) along the way as a built in insurance/hedging mechanism.\n\n\\- $250,000 in a straddle/some kind of exotic bird (condor?) that could keep us within a range of $330-$350 SPY , where anything in between or above nets a solid return.\n\nLadies and gentleman, thank you for your time, effort &amp; concern (in advanced)\n\n\\*\\*PS. Feel free to make any suggestions about a wild-crazy trade idea that you would do with this same package\\*\\*\n\nSigning off.\n\nLionel E.
