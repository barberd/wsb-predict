{"id": "e3k8b6", "title": "PTON short rates and Black Friday update", "selftext": "For those of you looking for an update, I am still holding my Jan 2020 $35 calls. I haven\u2019t sold any yet. It might be  a mistake, but I\u2019m a big believer in letting your winners ride while cutting losses quickly.\n\nThe short interest as a % of float has come down tremendously to 59.9%, still incredibly high, but much lower than the 80%+ we were dealing with a few weeks ago. The borrow rate has stayed mostly the same at between 5-7%. Something interesting happened today, however: for the first time that I\u2019ve seen, IB is reporting that they have no more shares in inventory to short. It could be a fluke, but if it is accurate, then the squeeze could be starting as the borrow rates go higher and shorts rush to the exits. \ud83e\udd1e \n\nBlack Friday update: I stopped by a class A mall with my family and finally bought the peloton bike. It didn\u2019t seem crazy busy to me, but the employees said it was the busiest day ever so far. When I tried to schedule a delivery date, the delivery times disappeared before I had a chance to confirm probably 4-5 times.  The delivery calendar is linked to PTON stores in the region (Philadelphia/Delaware/NJ area) so it should mean high demand. After clicking furiously on the dates and time I finally got a delivery date On the calendar for about 11 days from now. I\u2019m hoping this means that sales are good and that data somehow leaks out into the press/analyst community over the next few weeks...\n\nHope you all had a happy thanksgiving and have a great weekend!", "created_utc": 1575058726, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e3k8b6/pton_short_rates_and_black_friday_update/", "is_self": true}
