{"id": "fldx3q", "title": "If options are too expensive use Portfolio Margining for maximum YOLO", "selftext": "What's up guys, now that you've graduated from your week long options training course and are addicted to buying them, you might have noticed that they can get pretty expensive per contract! You can barely buy 1 share of Google but now everyone is talking about buying 1 option that costs way more!\n\nWhat do?\n\nWell enter the world of Portfolio Margining! You see, your competition is trading with a lot more flexibility than you.\n\nYeah I know, you just found out about normal margin and some of you cucks are actually paying a monthly subscription for a basic free feature of all brokerage accounts, but then you discovered the pattern day trader rule and you just got over the $25,000 threshold so that you could keep trading all day. \n\nWell, that's just \"Reg-T\" margin. In Reg-T margin, for long positions you don't have to put up all the money to buy a share of a stock, but you still have to put up all the money to buy an options contract. \n\nThere are other margining systems in existence and they are all better than Reg-T margin.\n\nOne of those margining systems is called Portfolio Margining, and aside from generally 90% lower margin requirements for almost any kind of trade, it also makes long options positions (buying calls or puts) marginable as well.\n\nWhat's the catch? Well for one, Robinhood doesn't offer it. Tastyworks, TD Ameritrade and Interactive Brokers do though. Generally, you need a minimum of $150,000 in the account and have to pass a test, but given how so many people started from the bottom and are here now, over the last week: its time.\n\nYou guys don't know the meaning of Personal Risk Tolerance yet, you're welcome!\n\nIn the next lesson we'll talk about cross margining.", "created_utc": 1584638840.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fldx3q/if_options_are_too_expensive_use_portfolio/", "is_self": true}
