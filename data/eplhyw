I bought a total of 16 calls expiring 1/17 for about $0.41 average, some were $0.60, some were $0.20. \n\nThe price shot up to $1.30, then dipped to $1.10. I didn't expect to make much more than $1100, so I sold everything. \n\nThat same call is worth $0.05 right now. \n\n\nPlease dont be greedy. If you're up $1000, don't wait for $2000. Be grateful some other guy just paid your rent and helped out on your tendies budget for next month.", "created_utc": 1579191595, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eplhyw/i_sold_tsm_calls_two_days_ago_and_made_1100_profit/", "is_self": true}
