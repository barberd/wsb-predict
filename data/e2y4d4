Bringing many who haven\u2019t yet bought Disney+ into the Disney fold.\n\nSome support for the growing Disney brand is the park operation. I\u2019m currently at the Magic Kingdom in Orlando, FL and was at Universal Studio yesterday. Both parks (and I\u2019m assuming EPCOT as well) are undergoing expansion/construction in their resort areas probably to accommodate an increase in park attendance. Not only this, but Disney has opened its newest theme park expansion Star Wars: Galaxies Edge which has yet to prove its profit generation. Coupled with Disney\u2019s series The Mandalorian, the show will very likely drive up park attendance at the new theme park.\n\nAll in all, 2020 will prove to be a massive year for Disney\u2019s parks and it\u2019s streaming service. If you haven\u2019t bought in a dip yet, do so before the next earnings because it will most definitely be big. If not, that will be due to construction costs at the parks and will be the centrally planned dip to make good earnings nonconsecutive and generate larger positive shifts in price.\n\nAnyways, that\u2019s been my Thanksgiving DD, enjoy the holidays and don\u2019t stop betting on wallstreet, my fellow autists.", "created_utc": 1574948254, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e2y4d4/never_bet_against_the_mouse/", "is_self": true}
