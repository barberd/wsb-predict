Inverse HnD, consolidation, or Death?", "selftext": "So NFLX has bounced off the resistance at about $344.40 for the third time in about a month, and if we count March, the fourth time in general. Assuming it holds i think i have identified an inverse HnD but still need a leg up and a breakout to confirm. Speaking of, NFLX has also tripled topped since May 16th at about $363.50. We've been trading in this channel since the 10th of May. When you look at the daily NFLX has really been sideways since Feb.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn top of all that I've plotted a descending triangle from the high of May 3rd to the lower high of June 10th.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith all that being said what's your analysis? Critique on mine? Volume has been below the MA since April on the daily.", "created_utc": 1560364356, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bzuutv/nflx_trading_channel_triple_top_triple_bottom/", "is_self": true}
