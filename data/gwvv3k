So, she spends here time shopping on Lululemon.\n\nI don't have a position here, nor do I have a price target, but I do have two interesting data points to call out to those making a play for ER.\n\n[This New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/13/technology/online-shopping-buying-sales-coronavirus.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share) has a graphic showing that LULU's online sales were up massively during COVID.\n\nChart is [here](https://preview.redd.it/c0toyji940351.png?width=990&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcab04d06c9072dec2507a11aad1a3659ff15dd6).\n\nAlso, Yipit Data did a webinar on LULU last Friday.   They shared [this chart](https://preview.redd.it/y6f84q4v30351.png?width=1193&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d8838d8573bb9c5cd79d78edb17931352b39880) that shows that LULU's online sales have now fully compensated for the loss of retail sales.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would have embedded the pictures in the post but for some reason we are all supposed to using Reddit in dark mode right now and I can't post pictures.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositions:  No LULU.   All PRPL.\n\nER Prediction:  You are going to lose money on your play.", "created_utc": 1591323980.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gwvv3k/lulu_dd_beckys_been_shopping_online_during_covid/", "is_self": true}
