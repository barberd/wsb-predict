Before we dig deeper into the nature and consequences of our discovery, we will discuss the background to the thesis and consider first what we know from history a few lessons;  \n\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Every other time this happened it ended badly for the global economy via recession.   \n\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 A Fed that lags and finances the Whitehouse will only add fuel to the flames... \"it's different this time\".  \n\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 The longer the delay in USD devaluation from Fed, the worst the blow is going to be in Equity markets. Assuming USD does not devalue materially into 2020 its repo will grow and continue expanding the balance sheet , one way or another eventually this is going to look like Fed has been financing the WhiteHouse and then the game is up.  \n\n\n[US05Y-US02Y](https://preview.redd.it/74367vgs2fn41.png?width=2536&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f8ae971f767fa10b1c31d93e8f0e432400d0a84)\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/US05Y/QaDmIy0Z-ALPHA-PROTOCOL-SEEKING-IMMEDIATE-EXTRACTION/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/US05Y/QaDmIy0Z-ALPHA-PROTOCOL-SEEKING-IMMEDIATE-EXTRACTION/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Protectionism is a serious error**. There is no yellow brick road to success with protectionism, and it is no surprise the US via media manipulation have the masses deluded. This is a necessary component to the makeup of the next economic cycle ; but it must be in balance, any overshoots or undershoots will destroy the effectiveness in manipulation.  \n\n\nCentral Banks have been buying 20% of Gold supplies, expressing a view on global risk at rates we have not seen since the Nixon era when mortgage rates were surpassed by wages and no surprises this is also happening again now! Those with a background in fixed income will know alarm bells are ringing louder than usual in bond markets with wages ticking higher than mortgage rates. This is not sustainable and when danger threatens and the crowd does not smell it, don't stand like a sheep, rather run like a deer.  \n\n\n[End Of The Cycle](https://preview.redd.it/s63ayufi0fn41.png?width=2548&format=png&auto=webp&s=38f1fe06a02813b2698922c3c3eefb03da1de2c0)\n\nNow that Pandora's Box has been opened, it is equally important to understand the consequences and have a pulse to guide us on [how to proceed](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/US05Y/74DeWBa2-Alarm-bells-ringing-on-the-2-s-5-s-curve-Recession-is-calling/):  \n\n\n[This is not a fire drill...](https://preview.redd.it/mifog6ln0fn41.png?width=2544&format=png&auto=webp&s=9573ab29b7197d82663df8fcd3540e71f9c03166)\n\n  \n**Consumer Staples**[in the decade long chart:](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/XLP/F9dwhY5e-Consumer-staples-Ride-the-Pig/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Consumer Staples](https://preview.redd.it/j7dfdi7t0fn41.png?width=2530&format=png&auto=webp&s=76c686ba0bd57d27efe726b4188444db0ed6db8a)\n\n[Vol exploded from the launchpad](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/VIX/0pHMAQ6d-Capitulation-Waters-in-VIX/), this was the \ud83d\udd11 to the puzzle that unlocked the use this chart to good advantage, time to start paying close attention for early signs of a turn. 85 was the target I called back in 2019, we are sitting at the highs now so time to start looking for a fade as VIX is miles ahead of the rest:\n\n[Diagram from October 2019:](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/VIX/0pHMAQ6d-Capitulation-Waters-in-VIX/)\n\n[VIX Q419](https://preview.redd.it/6m03zo071fn41.png?width=2524&format=png&auto=webp&s=f021d48a9e2d7f1d47d560538da8345e4a07d723)\n\nAfter the fact..\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[VIX Q120](https://preview.redd.it/5br2etfe1fn41.png?width=2542&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1744a32f82d7f7785657dfe13f1cb1672164f77)\n\n[German Equities](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/DEU30/rHRST8wB-ridethepig-DAX-2020-Macro-Map/) are another to track for signs of a floor at the end of the month, the 2020 targets have been cleared:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[DAX \\(before the fact\\)](https://preview.redd.it/904fmi762fn41.png?width=2658&format=png&auto=webp&s=e540d3fe9b72679e13ae3f9a12fed1a91a7a1ded)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[DAX \\(after the fact\\)](https://preview.redd.it/xfxnbizb2fn41.png?width=2620&format=png&auto=webp&s=22e3e7263e016767fd6438db72d6c0edbdb1c6f7)\n\nIt is the same case in US Equities... despite FED cutting 150bps, $700bn in QE and a $1.2T fiscal package.

This expectation of panic looks set to continue till month-end, I am no expert in virology but from talking to some Chief Exec\u2019s there is a sense that virologists have created something sensational here which is opening the door to overreaction and hype from governments and unlocking (btw in all the wrong places) doors they never thought were possible on both the fiscal and monetary side.
