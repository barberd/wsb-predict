I predict that renewable energy, most notably solar will have an explosive growth in the next month and years. With the entire world on lockdown, we see pictures of once heavily polluted cities are now very clear and clear of smog. We have to accept that oil is becoming a commodity of the past and renewable energy will take over the future. This lockdown will be that catalyst for consumers to go green. Hydrogen powered vehicles, solar power energy, and self sustainable ways to harvest energy is becoming increasingly attractive in the media. \n\n==============================================================\n\nTaken from a user on Stocktwits named WantedtoRetireEarly: \n\nGood comment from a solar installer: \"We've had to field more calls in the last month than I can remember in any April. We've made three sales with no contact with customers. It think the pandemic brings out the \"preper\" in people. Also, Tesla's solar tiles don't compete with anybody. They are a premium product and require special training to install. They also are integrated into the roof so maintenance and trouble-shooting is a bit more complicated. On that note Generac's inverter/battery offerings are a potential competition, but if you call them (I have numerous times) they don't have anyone who has information to give you on the technical aspects of an installation of their product line, specifically a retrofit for AC coupling of an existing PV installation. Finally, **Enphase's battery offing is whole house (up to 150 amps). SolarEdge's battery offering is only up to 25 amps per 7.6k inverter. I expect Enphase to overtake SE in the battery market when it becomes available.**\"\n\n==============================================================\n\nAn example for the growth of the renewable sector particularly solar:\n\n[https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Trump-Administration-Approves-Largest-US-Solar-Project-Ever.html](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Trump-Administration-Approves-Largest-US-Solar-Project-Ever.html)\n\nYesterday, an article was released **\"Trump Administration Approves Largest U.S. Solar Project Ever\"** \n\nU.S. Department of the Interior [approved](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-approves-plan-largest-solar-project-us-history) this week the biggest solar project in the United States ever\u2014an estimated US$1-billion solar plus battery storage project in Nevada. The project will consist of a 690-MW photovoltaic solar electric generating facility plus a battery storage facility. The project will be the world\u2019s eighth-largest solar power facility and is expected to generate enough electricity to power 260,000 homes in the Las Vegas area and potential energy markets in Southern California, the Department of the Interior said.\u00a0The Gemini project is expected to be built in two phases, with the first phase coming online in 2021 and final completion as early as 2022, the Department of the Interior said. The on-site construction workforce is expected to average 500 to 700 workers, with a peak of up to 900 workers, supporting up to an additional 1,100 jobs in the local community and injecting an estimated US$712.5 million into the economy in wages and total output during construction, the Interior said, at a time when [more than 20 million Americans](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Oil-Holds-Gains-Despite-Massive-Unemployment.html) have already lost their jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Abigail Ross Hopper, President and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), said, commenting on the project\u2019s approval:\n\n\u201c**The solar industry is resilient and a project like this one will bring jobs and private investment to the state when we need it most**. We appreciate the work that the Trump Administration has done to make this historic project a reality.\u201d\n\n\u201cGemini offers the **opportunity to showcase, at an unprecedented scale, what we believe to be one of the most promising technological advances in coupling battery storage to utility scale solar power to produce low cost renewable energy over the long term**,\u201d [said](https://www.quinbrook.com/post/blm-doi-issue-final-record-of-decision-for-milestone-690mwgemini-solar-battery-storage-in-nevada) David Scaysbrook, Co-Founder and Managing Partner of Quinbrook.\n\n==============================================================\n\nTechnicals say that as long as the market remains bullish, we can expect ENPH to continue to rally in up to $69 target in the short term. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3qee15xaomy41.png?width=966&format=png&auto=webp&s=b765a872e1dd0135c2bf6f6b59e985802324d031\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s5qrknh7omy41.png?width=968&format=png&auto=webp&s=857107525681ac61e8ab5a50109386079ed0364a\n\nBarclays analyst Moses Sutton raised the firm's price target on Enphase Energy to **$80 from $76 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares following the company's Q1 results**.\n\nEurope - **doubled revenue over Q4. Tripled sales force.** Spain, Netherlands, Belgium Germany all exciting. Asia and Latin America are seeing revenue increases. Australia is seeing expansion but they expect a slow down in the region but they believe we are well positioned to do well in the long term.  \n\n\nNew products: Engineers have been working hard to implement remote debugging. Shelter in place did impact overall engineering and were unable to ship beta units at end of Q1. They are shipping now and expect to have revenue in Q2.  \n\n\nIQ8 will be launched by Q4 and IQ8D for two panels is coming along well. Their solar panels will be **97.5% efficient.** Another big initiative: **Digital transformation**. Looking to develop a comprehensive digital platform for both homeowners and installers. When done right, it will serve as a **powerful catalyst to launch further sales. Expect to make significant progress in this area in 2020.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nENPH has been experiencing explosive growth pre-coronavirus era going from a $2 stock in 2018 to $59.09 in March 2020 and now they rallied up to $65 just two days ago and is now sitting at $58. Their balance sheet is pretty healthy, and they're expecting to continue to increase their revenue. Their estimated EPS growth next year is 38.80% but I'm 100% sure its going to be way more. As per Finviz, their annual EPS Growth in the past years is **53.50%,** annual sales growth in the past 5 years **12.70%,** quarterly revenue growth is **105.10**, and quarterly earnings growth is **2393.20%.** ENPH was also recently added to the S&P midcap growth 400. I project this stock will skyrocket to $200 in the next 1-2 years and possibly >$300 within 5 years. Right now, I currently have 11 contracts for ENPH $65 C 6/19 since I'm playing on this currently rally, and will continue to add in increments for longer dated calls for a long term investment. SEDG and TAN are good stocks as well but I currently like ENPH for the growth. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR ENPH $65 C 6/19", "created_utc": 1589418597.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gjc8lu/solar_energy_will_have_explosive_growth_coming/", "is_self": true}
