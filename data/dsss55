I'm an 18 year old kid that's trying to get his foot in the door of investing, but these long term savings are just too safe. I'm retarded through and through and want to try stumbling through the riskier side of investing, but I want to do it with style.\n\nMy parents have taken on all of my debt, and i'm really excited about what i'm studying, but I want to stop wasting my time and actually do something that could have potential monetary benefits. WSB seems like one hell of a place to start, and hopefully I learn enough tricks and tactics that in 5 years when i'm graduating, I can surprise my parents with a sizable chunk of fucking cash that might make the ensuing years of debt a little more manageable.\n\nI don't have insane amounts of money to throw around, but i'm a quick learner and i'm willing to take risks as long as I know the odds. The money i'm playing around with is money i've saved up from working, with the intention of investing it. If you'll have me, i'd like to be indoctrinated into the ranks of retards already polluting this subreddit and really live up to my potential. Maybe, just maybe, one day I'll be comparable to the likes of u/ControlTheNarrative, but for now i'm just trying to learn.\n\nWill you autists take me under your collective wings, hide me away from the SEC, and teach me how to lose money but in a way where THEORETICALLY I should've profited? In the very least, I need to know what the fuck guh is supposed to mean.", "created_utc": 1573102826, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dsss55/loads_of_free_time_not_quite_1000_and_a_penchant/", "is_self": true}
