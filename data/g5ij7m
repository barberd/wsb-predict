{"id": "g5ij7m", "title": "USO is beyond fucked: A look into the next 3 weeks", "selftext": "USO is currently ~80/20 between WTI june and july futures.\n\n10-k was filed yesterday that indicates rollover will happen on May 5-8: https://twitter.com/QuisitiveInvest/status/1252412411295920131\n\nThis means that USO will be attempting to sell ~25% of the outstanding /CLK contracts in two and a half week to then buy the next month contracts(the same for the 20% that will rolled from july to august). Now just yesterday the concept of negative WTI futures was proven to be a real possibility; every trader should know how the market is capable of ignoring a potential outcome until it happens for the first time. \n\n/CLK is currently trading at 13$ with a massive unwind coming up. With a publicly available announcement that 25% of outstanding contracts will be unwound in the near future, there is a very real chance speculators try to front-run this to escape the scenario we say yesterday. (Yes I'm aware its down a shit ton today, but as we saw it doesn't stop at $0)\n\nFurther reasons USO is fucked:\n\n- USO inflows have been record high in the last week, entirely coming from retail investors who think they're investing in oil at its current spot price. https://twitter.com/chigrl/status/1251493231394775041. At some point this is going to puke.\n\n- Most states are still shut down, and federal guidelines recommend 14 days of declining cases before opening up. There is almost zero reason storage capacity should open up before June contracts deliver.\n\n- Contango is at a record high %\n\nPotential ways USO fucks you instead: \n\n- Rumored OPEC meeting for May 10. Yes it's after rollover, but enough could leak to cause a slight pop.\n\n- The same retarted retail can prop this garbage up well over NAV for god knows how long. USO was trading ~8% above NAV at close yesterday; right now its probably closer to 20-30%.\n\nTl;DR USO puts for 6/19", "created_utc": 1587486898.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5ij7m/uso_is_beyond_fucked_a_look_into_the_next_3_weeks/", "is_self": true}
