{"id": "g6tg26", "title": "Technical upcoming fire storm: Pump bet on $JCP (JC Penny). Heat only rises, never falls. DD/YOLO. Call $3 likely hit near $10. $1 per contract= $2500 minimum, $3000 recommended for 3000 contracts.", "selftext": "This is the TL;DR version:\n\nAllow me to give some of you cats the meow you have been oblivious to this entire time: JCP is about to be set on fire, both in stocks and literally (maybe). **As we all know heat only rises, never falls.**\n\nJCP: Jcpenny, was and still is (strangely) one of the biggest clothing/style/makeup retailers out there. You may be fooled by their balance seat and their crumbling technicals but let me enlighten you on why this is a bet you want to go in on.\n\nJc penny has been hated on for awhile by investors and fool subscribers, the later of which also likely use RH exclusively as a broker, and that's all well and fine but there are multiple aspects that are overlooked:\n\n1. Despite Macy's and other similar retailers being worth more with better prospects only JCP was able to land contracts with several clothing brand or makeup companies like [Sephora](https://www.sephora.com/beauty/sephora-inside-jcpenney) for example.\n2. JCP has (cumulatively) arguably more expensive real-estate.\n3. Expanding on number 2, most of JCP's highest real estate properties in value are low traffic stores which they can cut to save money and sell for insane profits.\n4. Most of JCPs creditors (quantity) are trying to sway JCP from bankruptcy.\n5. JCP still has potential deals [working with more companies on the table.](https://ir.jcpenney.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/589/jcpenney-partners-with-thredup-in-new-business-model)\n6. JCP has brought BC(Bankruptcy) to the table, but they have a Pump balance sheet that, when combined with several creditors not wanting them to file, makes lt *~~very likely~~*, **nearly guarantee** that JCP will dodge bankruptcy and will continue on until their gamble fails and the company burns up.\n\nBefore continuing let me let you know what a pump balance sheet is because people who haven't been in the market long, or who have been in the market long but haven't really learned how it works (despite thinking they do) will need this education for Due Dilligence.\n\nNow as we all know, JCP \"balance sheet\" is a mess, and when you read \"pump balance sheet\" you likely  flipped back in your chair hitting the floor head first, and no I will not be paying for the damages for you being a dumbass. ;)\n\nA **\"pump balance sheet\"** is when a company that's not doing well, still has a \"balance sheet\" in terms of having access to assets, funds, and opportunities to turn around..........***temporarily***. Hence the word \"pump\" being included. Sometimes Pump balance sheets can temporarily turn companies around.......... for a short amount of time or it can result in an even shorter pump and dump period.\n\nAnd that's exactly why we are here ladies and gentlemen. JCP is going to dodge bankruptcy, announce partnerships that likely won't make it in time before the company implodes, will cut some of those high value real-estate, and **it will be enough to push a  short-term narrative that the company is improving and heading in the right direction. This will cause the stock set on fire and jump!!!!!**\n\n....***For a period of 1 week to 2 months*** depending on how they execute. At that point the company will implode, and while it may still be possible for them to still choose to go bankrupt at that time it's very likely that will be heading toward closing things down and liquidating instead.\n\nHowever, this very soon to come (very soon) pump in the stock is very very close to happening and this is the time to have JCP redeem itself by making people rich.\n\n**Options call:** minimum $3c, contracts I've seen are .01, which means a $1 per contract, 2500 contracts is $2500, but that's minimum, higher the better. Expected it will hit and slightly pass $6 with a good chance of passing 7. Lower chance it will head near $10. \n\nI will be going 3000 contracts in once I shift from my RH account back to Schwab, still waiting on the transfer. Have used RH for 3 months to try it out, see why it has mixed to mostly negative reception, nearly unusable on every level, oversimplified, makes kids think this is easy and they understand how it works, but they don't have any idea what they are doing. For me, it gives me no info and at best looks pretty...after hours when the design is green and black. \n\nYOLO, go all in, it's free money, grab it while it's hot. **Heat only rises up fools**, don't be sofa king wee tar ted trying to buy $USO calls at $500, it's not freaking happening. Due your DD. #DD #YOLO #JCgivesyoupenniesformillionsofDollars\n\nOne more piece of info, while many companies in many industries, worth more than JCP, skipped rent in April, [JCP actually paid rent](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/06/jc-penney-bucks-trend-pays-its-april-rent.aspx), and they got that money from their available resources that are undervalued as I say above, without any damage to their bottom line:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> While **Cheesecake Factory** ([NASDAQ:CAKE](https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/the-cheesecake-factory/cake/)) declared it will [stop paying rent](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/03/26/cheesecake-factory-cant-pay-its-april-rent-asks-it.aspx) during the coronavirus pandemic and other companies have called for a \"rent strike,\" one unlikely retailer,\u00a0**J.C. Penney** ([NYSE:JCP](https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/jc-penney/jcp/)), is honoring its monthly obligation. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust sayin. Can you dig it?
