{"id": "hjekk5", "title": "Quick DD: Buy Puts on PLNT for upcoming COVID restriction wave", "selftext": "When I saw this shit at +6.5% today I knew the top was in, and it was time. This is going to be quicker than my normal DD\u2019s and with less sources cited because I\u2019m doing it during the trading day while my girl and I are having mimosas in da crib to celebrate my new job, and I\u2019m trying to get the people tendies before this shit falls off the face of the earth.\n\n**PLNT has been set up with a successful franchisee model**\n\nPLNT has a pretty smart business model whereby franchisees own their own gyms and pay a cut back to the company (of totally gym memberships and revenue). The margins of 6.1% are reasonable to most franchisees. The other way they make their money is through being the sole supplier of gym equipment to the owners, as well as requiring maintenance/replacement every 5-7 years; these margins come out to 24% for PLNT fitness, solid gains.\n\nThey\u2019ve got a great model, bounced back decently post COVID, and have market cap to eat given 24 hour fitness and others are getting eaten alive. **So, where\u2019s the problem?**\n\nThe problem for PLNT is three-fold\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Franchisees and PPP: PLNT is essentially a network of small business owners, which obviously doesn\u2019t bode well rn. The business may have a good model, but owners can\u2019t afford to stay open. No patrons\\_\\_\\_\\_> gyms close\\_\\_\\_\\_> maintenance contracts 5-7 years out are fuct. PLNT also let members across the boards freeze memberships immediately when they closed down, sure to eat into those profit margins in the worst way\n2. The rise of home workout alternatives: Becky who just bought a fucking $3,000 PTON bike isn\u2019t going to want to slum it at PLNT. I hear you, though \u201cthat\u2019s not their market, though!\u201d No, it isn\u2019t but Becky\u2019s follow each other, and the fad will produce a downgraded counterpart. Oh wait, it already happened, because LULU just merged with Mirror. If you\u2019re not a class or you\u2019re not an in-home, you\u2019re on the downtrend rn. Granted, gyms have a significant place and I\u2019m not saying gyms are going extinct, but for the foreseeable future they are not going to be a) the convenient option b) the safe option c) the trendy option\n3. California is about to close today, and NYC is looking at walking things back: Your average small business can hardly survive ONE lockdown (see: 24 hr fitness) let alone two. PLNT outperformed airlines recently because people thought, well, even if you can\u2019t travel you can work out. People got sick in PLNT this week, and 200 patrons are now being told to self quarantine. Gyms are clearly going to become the next COVID whipping boy once we\u2019re done bloodsucking restaurants, bars, and beaches over the coming weekend. And guess where most of the PLNT gym network is located? The northeast and Cali.\n\nOther than that, it\u2019s just common sense. Stop playing SPY day in and day out based on not believing in COVID or thinking travel is the only thing affected by COVID\u2014gyms are a no-brainer in this new \u201ccrisis\u201d. The market as a whole only cares about DEATHS\u2014which is why it hasn\u2019t really been affected by the news\u2014but gyms/general policy care about CASES. Gyms are almost as bad as planes as far as vectors go\u2014probably worse. My gf is a middle class workout IG Becky and claims the rest of her flock is avoiding gyms even though they are open because they don\u2019t want their liberal followers to value-shame them and lose their following or look irresponsible to them; home workouts are CONTINUING to be the move. 24 hour fitness is basically a wrap, and it\u2019 only a matter of time before this PLNT rally hits a skid.\n\nYou could probably problematize if you dug enough into some research, but come on, just common sense this one, guy.\n\nPLNT 7/17 55p\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nCheck u/glorypants tweak on this bet that's a super smart way to play it in the comments below", "created_utc": 1593623932.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hjekk5/quick_dd_buy_puts_on_plnt_for_upcoming_covid/", "is_self": true}
