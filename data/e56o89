Office workers were busy with their cocaine induced insider-trading, while Mr Brightman was sitting at his Sequoia table with the new administrative assistant intern, Brittany under his desk. The usual Monday at RH. He was just about to reach the top when he saw his glass of Whiskey with one pill of Dedalon still dissolving at the bottom start shaking.

He shakily started walking towards the window and carefully lifted the blinders.  \nA horde of brave warriors wearing the colors of the war alliance of WSB were storming the bays of Menlo Park, quickly advancing towards RH. Mild spots of powdered Adderall were still visible under their noses when they reached the premises in their berserk.

The shockwaves of autistic screeching and infinite leverage did not take long to weaken the feeble structure of the building, with Richard still standing there not knowing if he should be fully erect or piss his balls off.
