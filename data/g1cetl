{"id": "g1cetl", "title": "Too much bullshit here about inflation", "selftext": "TL;DR Genuinely, if you believe the US is in any way shape or form teetering on the edge of inflation (or, lmao, hyperinflation), you're retarded.\n\nThe short of it is inflation happens when there is too much money floating around for too little supply. The value of your currency goes down with supply/demand, and goods goes up with supply/demand. Bread starts costing $20 and hookers and blow skyrocket to the millions. Many here seem to think the Fed overheating their printer will lead to inflation: they're retarded. Dollars don't exist just in the US, and they don't exist eternally either. There are many foreign countries who need to pay back their loans in dollars, and therefore buy dollars from us to pay them off. They also use dollars to buy US goods and services. Don't get me started on how the eurodollar works, that's another rabbit hole. In addition, when a company goes bankrupt or defaults, whatever money sitting on that balance sheet goes poof. Zilch. Nada. It's fairy dust, it doesn't exist. \n\nThe US is also a much stronger country than we were back in the 1930s. So strong, in fact, that we can literally print up enough money to crash *other* people's economies. We couldn't do that in the 30s. The last thing on JPow's mind as he cranks that printing lever is inflation. The real issue is deflation, this is what happens when there are not enough dollars flowing through the system. If you have dollars and I have goods that you want to purchase, it works, but what if now you want to use those dollars but there's nothing that you want to purchase? The flow of liquidity in the system stops when consumption goes down, regardless of the supply of goods or the supply of cash. Inflation is a supply-side problem, deflation is a demand side. It is very easy to control supply of both US dollars and US goods, it is *not* easy to control demand for those goods and dollars. As I mentioned before the main demand right now is dollar loans from foreign countries. When banks no longer want to lend money to companies, the Fed has to step in to backstop it with their money printer or the whole system crashes, that's why JPow is revving the alphabet soup as we speak.\n\nDon't worry about inflation, worry about deflation because that's what'll really cause companies and banks to go bankrupt/default in the long run", "created_utc": 1586893468.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1cetl/too_much_bullshit_here_about_inflation/", "is_self": true}
