Doing the research so you don't have to](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fne6fx/surviving_coronavirus_with_jd_doing_the_research/), and wanted to share a brief update on JD and inspiration for gains.\n\nAs China has successfully managed to lift their quarantine, and the rest of the world settles in for a protracted lockdown, investments in Chinese companies are looking more attractive. [JD.com](https://JD.com) is one of the few companies that managed to successfully navigate the coronavirus lockdown in China (demonstrated through revenue growth and surging demand), and has little exposure to the rest of the world (aside from retail and e-commerce in SE Asia, which is an asset during lockdown). With many days of negative S&P and positive JD, an [upgrade from Morgan Stanley](https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/upgrades/20/04/15808492/benzingas-top-upgrades-downgrades-for-april-15-2020), and ongoing Chinese recovery, JD will continue to be in the news more frequently, and more investors will appreciate the growth play that it represents.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dangerous political environment:** \n\n\\- Number of countries, with [leadership from the US](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/08/coronavirus-crisis-is-turning-americans-both-parties-against-china/) and the UK, are increasingly blaming China for coronavirus and calling for severe economic punishment. Although this is highly unlikely in the middle of a pandemic where China is the only country where factories are actually working, it is highly likely that politicians will attempt to shift blame from their own missteps during the crisis, and take a more confrontational stance towards China.   \n\\- A the same time, China continues appalling levels of cover-up, on everything from [not disclosing the emerging pandemic quickly enough](https://apnews.com/68a9e1b91de4ffc166acd6012d82c2f9), to [manipulating number of cases/deaths](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/asia/coronavirus-china-grief-deaths.html), to [hiding the origin of the virus, and attempting to shift blame for the virus away from itself (and blaming the US)](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/30/beijing-coronavirus-response-see-what-sticks-propaganda-blame-ccp-xi-jinping/). China is also aggressively pushing an internal disinformation/censorship campaign and an international PR/propaganda campaign to [pitch themselves as saviors and use this pandemic to obtain further influence on the international arena](https://thehill.com/policy/international/490719-china-sees-chance-to-expand-global-influence-amid-pandemic).  \n\\- These two trends are likely to result in further major confrontation with likely economic consequences between the US and China, if not other countries. And with Trump being up for re-election this year, he will do everything to shift blame away from his poor handling of the pandemic and conduct a grand theater of \"punishing China\" to appease his supporters  \n\\- Given the above, it is possible that US may take draconian actions towards China in the Summer/Fall timeframe, after the crisis becomes more manageable. No one knows what these actions will be, but they may include further sanctions of individuals/companies, tariffs, restriction of access to the financial markets, more aggressive support to move certain supply chains (such as pharmaceutical production) out of China, and more restrictions on Chinese companies for access to US capital markets (partly due to [LK and TAL fraud scandals](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ywang/2020/04/10/china-stocks-face-increased-scrutiny-after-tal-education-and-luckin-coffee-reveal-inflated-sales/#4a2373f2d51b))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Takeaway:**  \n\\- JD represents a great growth opportunity, but will be impacted by the shifting political winds, likely around when the pandemic starts winding down in the US/most of Europe (which will not happen for at least a month)\n\n\\- JD will have their next earnings on \\~5/8, and they had announced an \"at least double digit\" YoY revenue growth. I expect they will meet the minimum 10% mark, and they will be one of the few companies during this earnings season that will have positive YoY quarterly growth and full-year guidance\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Disclaimer:** \n\nThe earnings season will be bad, with likely misses and lowered guidance across the board, which may drag down JD in the short/medium-term. However, it is encouraging that JD is often outperforming S&P 500.\n\nAlthough this is still a longer-term, high growth play (200-300% in 1-2 years, with right positions), with a potential for a shorter term high profits through the earnings season, you should be very careful to not get caught up in a US-China spat. \n\nAlways remember, the advice you see on here is enthusiasts sharing their opinion, and should NOT be taken as a credible financial advice, especially if you don't know what you're doing. Liquidate your account, uninstall Robinhood, sign up for an actual brokerage, talk to a financial advisor (most of them will do it for free), and take online courses before you start throwing money away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:** \n\n\\- May 22 2020 $52 Calls (Risky)\n\n\\- June 19 2020 $50 Calls (Risky)\n\n\\- September 18 2020 $55 Calls (Moderately Risky)\n\n\\- Jan 15 2021 $45 Calls (Moderately Risky)\n\n\\- Jan 21 2022 $55 Calls (Moderately Risky)\n\n\\- Pay attention to US-China and US-World politics to unwind JD positions before things escalate in the Summer\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Gains:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3vvpkjiul8t41.png?width=485&format=png&auto=webp&s=93b0a60c9a55e476e2114370de55c5ae235a44e2", "created_utc": 1587070847.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2njn2/surviving_coronavirus_with_jd_updates_and_gains/", "is_self": true}
