From criticizing the coronavirus \\[[1](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1236029449042198528)\\] to posting memes about the lockdown \\[[2](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1249207285785808896)\\], Elon has done it all. Like father, like son, TSLA has also been on a wild ride. Jumping off a cliff from its initial high of 968.99 to a pitiful low of 361.22 and today retracing to the %50 fibonacci 665.11. Is this a trap? will it all go tits up again? is TSLA\u2019s rally over? What will earnings on 4/22 entail?\n\n**PART 1: Foreplay**\n\nRemember pre-beer-flu era where stocks only went up even without JPOW printing $$ out of his ass? As many of you guys remember, TSLA went on a run the weeks leading up to Rona. Some on WSB raked in those sweet sweet tendies while others looked on with jealousy and regret. What if I\u2019m telling you that the next green rocket ship is right around the corner, and it\u2019s in part due to Robotaxis. Much like the electric dildo your wife uses after your 3-incher fails to satisfy her, autonomous machines are taking the place of everything in this world. Uber usher in the first revolution of the multi-billion-dollar industry of taxis with its platform, but the next iteration is coming soon. Back in December, investors saw potential in a fully-autonomous taxi service and theorized that TSLA\u2019s autonomous driving capabilities might one day be suitable for its implementation. But there were many critics that doubted autonomous driving\u2019s safety and commercial appeal. However, the coronavirus hit and now no one wants to ride in a car with some low-life driver who\u2019s probably been eating bats in Wuhan the day before. Robotaxis didn\u2019t seem like such a bad alternative all of a sudden \\[[3](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2020/04/13/can-robotaxis-survive-a-pandemic/#20a1034e2ca6)\\]. The technology still needs a lot of time to fully develop, but the fundamentals are laid, and the theory is proven. This type of market exists and TSLA is in just the right spot to fill it. A main contribution of TSLA\u2019s recent 34% rally is this autonomous network. But some theory of a possible robot taxi service isn\u2019t going to send TSLA to the moon any time soon. What I\u2019m about to say next will really push you to finally sell those -99.9% SPY 250 4/15s and roll them over to TSLA 1000C 4/17s.\n\n**PART 2: Daddy Xi\u2019s Basement**\n\nUnlike the United States, China isn\u2019t addicted to oil. It does have a little dependency but not to the point where every household owns at least one car. For one there\u2019s too many people in China to make cars even worthwhile and for another most of its citizens are too poor to support owning a gas-guzzling 4-wheeler when gas prices are 4x those here in the US. If any of you unfortunate retards have ever been to rural China, you\u2019ll know exactly what I\u2019m talking about. Everyone and I mean everyone from middle schoolers to 80-year olds owns an electric moped \\[[4](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/why-electric-motor-scooters-are-leading-electric-vehicle-revolution-in-asia)\\]. That\u2019s how they get around. Oh you want to go to Ching-Chong\u2019s house after school to get some dog meat for your dumplings? Will then hop on a moped and zoom on over. China\u2019s entire transportation system is built around these electric fuckers. So it\u2019s no wonder when TSLA finally befriended Xi and was allowed into the CCP, they saw a massive increase in sales \\[[5](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1127785_tesla-sales-took-30-of-china-s-ev-market-in-march)\\]. Now they own 30% of the ENTIRE Country\u2019s Electric vehicle market. That may not sound like a lot to the Freedom-loving cucks of America where only Fags and Curry-lovers drive electric vehicles. But in the CCP, that means big money. As the Chinese economy improves and people start getting richer, normal citizens are going to replace their shitty mopeds with these brand new Teslas. As long as Elon can refrain from pissing off Xi and getting kicked out, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see Teslas becoming the most common brand in China. In fact the Tesla revolution has already begun. Go to the big cities of Shanghai, Beijing, etc. and you\u2019ll see Teslas lining the streets. \\[[6](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Tesla-Sets-Sales-Record-In-China-Despite-Coronavirus-Crisis.html)\\]. So what does all this mean for you. In the Long term TSLA is definitely going to become a trillion dollar company, but I know none of you extra-chromosome \u201ctraders\u201d have the patience to wait years into the future. Lucky for you, TSLA earnings are on the 22nd and there looks to be a massive play. Wall Street is giving TSLA an abysmal -0.21EPS \\[[7](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/earnings)\\], and I believe TSLA can easily beat. With its sales in China peaking to ATHs even while Corona ravaged the world. I\u2019m loaded to the tits since last Thursday with 590C, 650C, 700C 6/19s and I\u2019ll load up pre-earnings with even more.\n\n\\[1\\] - [https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1236029449042198528](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1236029449042198528)\n\n\\[2\\] - [https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1249207285785808896](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1249207285785808896)\n\n\\[3\\] - [https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2020/04/13/can-robotaxis-survive-a-pandemic/#20a1034e2ca6](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2020/04/13/can-robotaxis-survive-a-pandemic/#20a1034e2ca6)\n\n\\[4\\] - [https://www.wired.co.uk/article/why-electric-motor-scooters-are-leading-electric-vehicle-revolution-in-asia](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/why-electric-motor-scooters-are-leading-electric-vehicle-revolution-in-asia)\n\n\\[5\\] - [https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1127785\\_tesla-sales-took-30-of-china-s-ev-market-in-march](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1127785_tesla-sales-took-30-of-china-s-ev-market-in-march)\n\n\\[6\\] -[https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Tesla-Sets-Sales-Record-In-China-Despite-Coronavirus-Crisis.html](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Tesla-Sets-Sales-Record-In-China-Despite-Coronavirus-Crisis.html)\n\n\\[7\\] - [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/earnings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/earnings)\n\nTLDR: Robots and Rice farmers are the key to TSLA\u2019s future takeover of the world.
