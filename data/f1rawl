I'm up $900 on them this morning, thoughts on earnings play? I'm thinking to hold until Thursday to play the run-up and sell before close.\n\nAnyone else playing ROKU? Thoughts on selling around $135? Does anyone have any insider info? I feel like they must have had great holiday sales - I have 2 ROKU TVs in my NYC apartment and I just left my brothers and he has 5 around his house.", "created_utc": 1581346103, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f1rawl/roku_earnings_play/", "is_self": true}
