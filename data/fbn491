I am wanting to make some quick money now to then invest in ETFs that I'll keep for a long-ass time. I also really want to learn what all this is abt cuz it seems fun af. Where should I start\n\nBlah blah blah autist blah blah blah retarded blah blah blah gay bears blah blah blah fuck the bulls\n\nNow that that's out of the way\n\nWHere should I get started. My dad said he won't let me buy option but my mom doesn't know shit about the market and will probably let me, so I'm gna make two custodial accounts, one sensible funds one with my dad and one YOLO options one with my mom. I have about $2k but really don't want to lose it all so I'm thinking I'll start with about 500-750 in options.\n\nI'm thinking 3/6 TSLA 550 puts, 4/17 TSLA 480 puts, SPY 230 3/27 puts, 200 6/19 MSFT calls, and AMD 47 3/20 calls\n\nwhich of these are the safest moves to make a reasonable profit or are any other ones a better move or should I go get fucked in the ass and stop asking retarded questions", "created_utc": 1583028133, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbn491/15_yearold_wanting_to_get_started/", "is_self": true}
