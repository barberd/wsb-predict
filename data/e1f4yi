Each and every time I went in nearly every employee was participating in a circle jerk while the few patrons that were there roamed around viewing BBY\u2019s limited supply. Not once did I find what I was looking for and ended up buying everything from Amazon. \n\nA few years ago they would have three registers open at checkout because it was poppin... no longer the case, I had to motion for someone to come check me out for a PACK OF GUM.
