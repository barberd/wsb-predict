{"id": "he7p93", "title": "[Chart] Voodoo & [Options] Chains - $NKE and $FSLY", "selftext": "Somehow we managed a green Monday. Let's hear it for the bulls. Bear gang walks home gay and empty-handed. If you held $SQ or $NVDA over the weekend, congratulations! Occasionally, diamond hands pay off. I'm sure you made some tendies. I know I did.\n\nEnough boasting, I'm not a total dick (only in person). I have a few disclaimers I want to put out real quick: 1) You should never trade anything you see on here without doing research of your own, 2) Never put more into one position than you're willing to lose, 3) Trading is all about patience - which is going to be important this week.\n\nOkay - I know, \"Shut the fuck up and get to the details, moron. I have money to throw away.\" What are some big things to look out for this week?\n\n1) Bank stress test on Thursday - this is going to give us some good insight on whether the financial sector can handle an unexpected event/adversity. Do not underestimate how important this is. Watch for possible lower volume until Thursday. I'm going to play the banks, but it's going to be last minute when I have a better idea of which side to play.\n\n2) COVID-19 daily reported cases. Things are starting to feel uneasy again. I live in Texas, and I know my county made it mandatory again to wear masks while indoors in public. Mamma didn't raise no bitch, but this is definitely something to monitor.\n\n3)  US/China tensions. Is the trade deal over? I mean we all knew it was over 6 months ago, and 6 months before that, and 6 months before that... but is it over?\n\n4) Oil uncertainty. Chevron JV in Saudi Arabia restarting shipments despite OPEC deal. Others likely to follow.\n\nIf I missed anything big, and I'm autistic so I probably did, please put it in the comments. It's show-and-tell and everybody and their brother wants to hear about it.\n\nIf you don't like Kaepernick, you won't wear this brand mid calf and you won't trade this stock: **$NKE**\n\n[1 year chart](https://preview.redd.it/zbk39424qk651.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a915056770afdec8f82a9621e2e190f281c9ba4)\n\n[1 month chart](https://preview.redd.it/evyxu736qk651.png?width=1013&format=png&auto=webp&s=a304d2bc9a93cd9ad55d1bba7bb96eab2702bfa9)\n\nSo tbh no one requested this one. I was thinking about America, the 4th of July, and tendies... then I had this memory come back to me. Last year - on June 30th - while getting ready for America's most patriotic day, I wrote up some DD on $NKE. I predicted the continuation of a trend (inverse head and shoulders), recommended a play, and it eventually came to fruition. There was money to be made. To the bars! People laughed, beers were drunk, mistakes were made, people cried. Not gonna talk about it.\n\nWhy do I like $NKE? The company makes some dope shoes, joggers, I rep their socks 50% of the time (the other 50% of the time is a mix of random brands), their marketing team is g(ay)reat, they make a mean profit. \n\nMy one complaint about $NKE last year was that they had too much of a cash pile and I suggested more marketing/R&D. Turns out, having too much cash was a good thing (COVID). Not only do they have cash reserves, but the long term debt on the company's books is very modest. As J \"Daddy\" Pow once said \"stonks only go up\", so does $NKE's revenue, EBITDA, and FCFs YoY, QoQ, possibly even DoD. I have multiple degrees in accounting and finance and $NKE's financials make me pretty hard (humble brag...).\n\nEarnings estimates are very reachable at just $0.09 EPS. Even if it beats estimates, can this stock keep pumping? Is the risk of China trade too great to play the upside? How much is already priced in? ER is on 6/25.\n\nQuick peak at the options chain shows a priced in movement of about $3 on both sides after ER. Volume and open interest on the options chain are pretty high. Put/call ratio for volume is pretty bullish, ratio for open interest is barely bearish. RSI and MACD are both pretty bullish.\n\nTomorrow I'm going to watch the price, wait, and make a decision. What looks attractive to me right now? 7/2 105c and 110c. 6/26 105c are pretty cheap, too, but theta and IV decay are something you have to watch out for. There is a lot of uncertainty in the market right now. Don't blindly buy these.\n\nThe next one on the list is one that I have heard a lot about, but was rather unfamiliar with up until now: **$FSLY**\n\n[1 year chart](https://preview.redd.it/ji6axw5ixk651.png?width=809&format=png&auto=webp&s=978330dfcffc5fd2278c87f9ac5590bc4efe3da2)\n\n[1 month chart](https://preview.redd.it/3krds49pxk651.png?width=805&format=png&auto=webp&s=82db0b39170f2ce693a932da00de951e3c99ee41)\n\nSome local retard recommended I do some DD on $FSLY so here it is. $FSLY is not profitable. It is near-profitable. It wants to be profitable. But it is not profitable. When I read a summary of the business operations and took a peak at the financials I saw big data and fast delivery. I'm young and I know what that means: a future of profitability (if properly managed of course). \n\n$FSLY joined our ranks last year with a May 2019 IPO. It's currently trading at ATHs with very high volume to back that up. RSI is signaling overbought, MACD is signaling the bull run must go on. Volume and price action signal investors could never be more optimistic. \n\nThe upside is uncharted territory (seriously go look at options chain. Calls only go up to the 90 strike). It could go *anywhere*. There are no specific resistance levels. The downside is pretty clear. This was a $20 stock not too long ago. It could go *anywhere*. \n\nThe options chain is pricing a movement of about $10 post-ER. Volume and open interest are both bullish. ER is 8/6 and recent EPS have fallen between -$0.05 and -$0.20.\n\nWhat does this stock really have going for it? Coronavirus. Work-from-home. Data and the transfer and storage of that data is more important now than ever. $FSLY will most likely win in the future, regardless, but can rona speed up its success? \n\nMy play for this fast-mover? Wait for a big red day and get in on some leaps. I'm thinking a post-earnings play. 8/21 90c don't look that bad, but I think the premiums will drop. If you don't want to play earnings the 7/10 80c are not that bad. A major part of this play is if daily rona cases continues to rise. Again, I suggest waiting for the price to drop a bit or at least flatten.\n\nTL;DR\n\nBe patient. Look at the events I pointed out in 1-4 and play accordingly.\n\n$NKE barely OTM calls to play ER - 7/2 105c and 110c\n\n$FSLY deep OTM calls to play ER and capitalize on rising COVID cases - 8/21 90c and 7/10 80c", "created_utc": 1592885474.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/he7p93/chart_voodoo_options_chains_nke_and_fsly/", "is_self": true}
