The recent weakness is cyclical, as more and more applications are being found and put mainstream. ADI has great dividends and is expecting to hike during this quarter. \n\n**Technical**: Priced above in 20, 50, 200 day moving averages.  MACD shows bearish convergence. RSI shows around 50, neutral. Options sentiments are very bullish in volume and very bullish in open interest, mostly due to a likely call credit spread 118/124 with almost 3000 volume today. Implied movement of about 3.4% or 4$.\n\n**Sentimental**: Analog devices has a stellar dividend payout and a looming increase. In addition, with the new 5G cycle coming out, this represents another cycle of opportunities for ADI. While YoY performance is weak, especially in EPS, I believe the dividend increases and perceived optimistic outlook will move the price action green. As long as ADI beats/inline top &amp; bottom line this quarter.\n\n**ROI: 22%**\n\n**Risk Level: 3 out of 5, Risky**\n\nPlay -  [https://imgur.com/a/xE4tM8T](https://imgur.com/a/xE4tM8T)  (Robinhood)\n\n  \nBuy 111$ 3/6 Put \n\nSell 113$ 3/6 Put", "created_utc": 1582054681, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f5xd70/analog_devices_earnings_2192020_bmo/", "is_self": true}
