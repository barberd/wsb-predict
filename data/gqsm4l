{"id": "gqsm4l", "title": "Ingenius options play", "selftext": "So this weekend was extra long i decided to hash out the old blackscholes formula out of the dusty textbook from 160 years ago and it says, get this, value of the option is proportional to sqrt of time. But markets are CLOSED during weekends, but there is still value. Holy crap, the infusion of power the einsteinian quantum mechanical sqrt of t gave me the ultimate strategy - sell straddle at the close of friday and buy back on monday morning first thing. Noway you can lose, no way. And on bank holiday weekends, sell tripple cos people are on holiday, it doesnt move, free money. WOW, genius, no one will ever think of this because they too busy running out of the office to their weekends and you look like a pro for selling vol because all pros sell vol, its a fact. \n\nTldr: sell straddle every weekend and buy back monday open. Free money bruh.", "created_utc": 1590478930.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gqsm4l/ingenius_options_play/", "is_self": true}
