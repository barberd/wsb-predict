I just cant believe it...\n\nSo maybe you wonder what I did here... let me explain.\n\nI opend one of my old accounts... a shitty CFD broker where I made so many tendies that my wife's boyfriend almost got a new wardrobe to hide in(sure I did)\n\nSo I got full pro-autist-mode and activated ALL possible indicators.\nand now... BREATHE!!!\ncan you see the information clearly?\nSure you can so lets beginn...\n1.first of all this broker is clearly shit... I mean cmon do they really call the S&amp;P 500 just... \"US 500 FKN KASSA (1E)\"???\n2.we see the \"US 500 KASSA shit\" is right before 3100 \u00a0\n3. now look at my CPU usage... can u see it? sure you can, CPU is at 3,92GHz what we have to do now is to multiply this with the current year\nso... 3,92 * 2020 = 7.918,4 \u00a0 \u00a0 okay\nwhat do we do with this number?\n\n4. because the market has a canche of 50:50 we have to divide this by 2\n7.918,4 /2 = 3.959,2 \u00a0AHHH and now we see it\n\nmarket wants to go to the 3959,2 resistance. (jeah there is one !!!!)\n\n5. okay it hits 3959,2 but whats next?\ntrust me...\njust trust me...\nso my CPU usage is by 23% right? that means markets go down by 23% after this\n\nNow you would think:\" but OP your CPU usage rose to 23% and so will SPY\" but no fkn redtard!!!!\nand here is where the inverse-master comes in place.\ndoes my CPU really increase by 23% or does is lose 23% of its 100%???\n\nand now we got it.\nSPY will fall 23% of its 3959,2\nand thats...\n3.048,6\nso in the end our spy puts will expire worthless.\n\nWhat a great time to be alive. \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b", "created_utc": 1583355898, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fdjqjp/i_just_found_the_truuuth/", "is_self": true}
