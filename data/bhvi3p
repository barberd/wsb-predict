And that dude got rich.\n\nOK? So what? Is this result replicable? That is the real question there.\n\nI don't give a fuck some idiot got lucky and won a lottery. I am interested in how to replicate it myself. Why would a person be holding worthless, almost certainly going to expire worthless OTM calls this month? Did he know something? Insider info? Or he did this bullshit every month with spare money on all kinds of stocks, and he just somehow hit big this time?\n\nSimp cucks equate luck with skills. That's why simps are simps and the majority of them will remain simps. It's the epitome of the Just World Fallacy. If someone won big in the stock market, he must have done something right. But smarter people knows it simply doesn't work like that.\n\nThere's a saying in investing, better lucky than right. Luck in my opinion is a huge factor in making big money in stocks.
