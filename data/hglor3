Sources within the company already hearing talks of SeaWorld off-loading all of their animals. PETA is offering them a quarter million to build a sea-side sanctuary for those animals if they are serious about doing this.\n\n\"This would result in a dramatic decrease is recurring set costs while also making the park\u2019s even more appealing to potential buyers. NBCUniversal was previously rumored to be interested in the Orlando and California parks, but unwilling to involve itself in the hot button orca captivity controversy. If Kleiman is correct and if SeaWorld can find a new home for its animal collection, we may see the board move the company into bankruptcy where it could more easily break up the parks to multiple buyers while also helping Hill Path finally see a return on its investment.\"- Ken Storey of Orlando Weekly\n\nAnd yes, you may say that SeaWorld says that they have enough cash from their debt offering to keep them a float until 2021. But what company is 100% honest? They wouldn't want to scare away investors would they? They have copious amounts of liens from contractors they have not paid for projects that are either finished or discontinued. Their largest investor, Hill Path investing, has a huge stake in both SeaWorld and Dave & Busters. Two companies that are getting gang banged by this pandemic. Chances of Hill Path sticking around for lackluster returns and a recovery that is not guaranteed are slim.\n\nAnd now we have Disney pushing their reopening date indefinitely. Florida just announced that they are slowly shutting down businesses. It starts with bars, leads to restaurants, and then its the clothing stores, and then we get the parks and arenas. It is a matter of time before they shutdown SeaWorld digging an even deeper hole in their pockets. They are calculated to have 193 Million dollars on hand but according to the San Diego Union Tribute, \"It will need more than that to survive months of park closures\" Once they do get shut down, how much cash will they be burning, and how long till they start defaulting on their loans and their liabilities and debt exceeds their equity.
