{"id": "h10rw8", "title": "Video games are the future. ATVI DD inside.", "selftext": "What's up fuckers. TSLA fuckboy here writing a post about video games. Go figure. I posted the link about Daddy Elon and legalizing weed last weekend, and ***got fucking*** ***temporarily banned*** for it because I flaired it with DD. It definitely wasn't DD. Learn from my mistake and don't fuck around with flairs or the mods. In my defense, I have ADHD, was high af, and am likely retarded. I served my sentence, and am here to try to redeem myself with some real DD on Activison-Blizzard (ATVI). I actually wrote this a few days ago when ATVI was $68 (proof attached), but couldn't post it until now. That's ok though, I committed a sin and you all have to pay the price by getting this DD 4 days late (love you mods). Don't fret though (like the market this morning wtf), there is still time for tendies.\n\nI'm long ATVI. They are going to steadily rise for the next 5-10 years. In the paragraphs below, you'll learn why. To be fair, I bought puts on BYND when it was trading at $70 in April, so, *I'm pretty fucking smart*. Do your due diligence (or fucking don\u2019t, whatever). *Obligatory this is not financial advice.*\n\nPictures, positions and **TL;DR at the bottom** for those of you that don\u2019t know how to read (and let\u2019s be honest, most of you don\u2019t know how to read. Most of you need crayons to *eat* while you look at pictures. Lookin at you 220p SPY bag holders lmao.) That or you have the [attention span of the stock market in March](https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-MARKETS/0100B5L144C/index.html). Either way, enjoy!\n\n# Long-Term thoughts\n\nYou know that saying, the one that rich-fucks who inherited a bunch of money from their crazy aunt (they've never even met this Aunt obviously) say, \u201cYou gotta make your money work for you or you'll never be rich!\u201d Yeah, well fuck those people. I got one better. I make ogres and trolls and wizards and guns (oh my) do the work for me, and it turns out they work really fucking hard, 24/7/365.\n\nActivison-Blizzard is one of the biggest powerhouses of the video game industry and I think they have a tremendous opportunity for growth in the long term. They are also recession/virus/pandemic/protest proof. And in reality, most of these things actually make ATVI more attractive.\n\nCan\u2019t go outside because there's a fucking curfew (we have to be in a simulation), or your downtown is literally on fire from a protest and there\u2019s a deadly virus just hanging out on every corner trying to murder your grandma? Cool. You don\u2019t give a fuck because you\u2019re sitting in your Lovesac (just fucking don't), playing COD while eating your BYND meat fake burger with a non-gmo, organic, gluten-free lettuce wrap with a 42oz Monster at 3 am. Why face reality when video games are so much more fun, AND you don't have to put on pants. Also, the gov is literally handing out money to people on unemployment.\n\nPut on your thinking cap and think really fucking hard for a second. *Really hard.* Do you think there's a correlation between people that are unemployed (and getting insane unemployment payments + stimulus + more stimulus at the end of July and are basically being **ENCOURAGED TO STAY HOME**), and the likelihood of that person playing video games? Hmm. FUCKING MAYBE.\n\n**Earnings** \\-  **They make lots of money lol**\n\nThey have *crushed* [recent earnings](https://investor.activision.com/static-files/2697764c-6dfa-47da-898b-0ee1ab2d3439) (and most other earnings), and they have [really fucking solid financials](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ATVI/financials?p=ATVI). Boatloads of cash on hand and relatively low debt. They have rock-solid management that has been there for years, and they are devoted to the company. Here's some great info on [how they make money](https://www.investopedia.com/how-activision-blizzard-makes-money-4799286).\n\nAlso, **most importantly,** u/fuzzyblankeet said *\"they are a great company\"* (proof attached) and that guy doesn't fuck around.\n\n**Current and upcoming games**\n\n1. **COD -** (literally prints fucking money every single release) and the new free-to-play [Warzone mode has been insane](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-reaches-another-huge-player-m/1100-6476877/), taking tons of market share from Fortnite and PUBG. They also have gotten tremendous traction with their [COD Mobile game](https://dotesports.com/mobile/news/cod-mobile-surpassed-180-million-downloads-with-second-best-launch-ever-in-mobile-games). They will also obviously announce a new COD for the next-gen consoles coming from Microsoft and Sony, Holiday 2020. This holiday season will *unquestionably* be the most gigantic video game fiesta the world has ever seen, and COD will be the Fucking King. Mark my words.\n2. **Overwatch 2 -** No date announced yet, but you can bet your allowance (that your wife's boyfriend gives you) that they're gonna try and get it out during the Holiday season. I bet it sells 45-55 million copies, on top of all the micro-transactions, [similar to its predecessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overwatch_(video_game)).\n3. **Diablo 4 and Diablo Immortal -** Diablo's fan base are addicts. [Blizzard killed it with Diablo 3](https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2015/08/05/believe-it-or-not-diablo-3-is-now-the-10th-best-selling-video-game-of-all-time/#35d2cf4c2ab4), and many people expect these 2 new games to be even more epic. One of them being a console game similar to Diablo 3 (for next-gen consoles obviously), and the other being a free-to-play (micro.fucking.transaction'$) game made for iPhone/Android (lol losers). Much smaller fan base than COD/Overwatch, but still, 10's of millions is pretty massive.\n4. **WoW -** Not what it used to be, but still has a large player base of millions. They are releasing another new expansion this year and the revitalization of its [classic Wow has been a hit](https://www.newsweek.com/world-warcraft-subscriptions-triple-classic-release-1461086).\n5. **Hearthstone -** More than 100 million people have played the game as of 2018 (most recent data I could find). I'd guess that with their new Battlegrounds Mode, in addition to multiple yearly expansions, this game will continue pulling in significant revenue for years to come, especially if they find ways to invent new game modes that bring old players back.\n6. **Starcraft -** Although this area of the business doesn't make them much money right now, I think it's safe to say that the Starcraft Universe still carries a lot of weight in a lot of gamers' minds. I wouldn't be surprised if we see a Starcraft 4 or some mobile variation of it in the next 3 years, and I think that it would do excellent.\n7. **Hero's of the Storm -** The game is still played, but is definitely one of the smallest revenue generators for them.\n8. **Revitalizing Spyro and Crash Bandicoot -** Although there is no real news on theses getting re-vamped, ATVI thinks of them as a [flagship brand](https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2019/06/05/activision-blizzard-considers-crash-bandicoot-and-spyro-flagship-brands/). I bet they sell a shit load of copies each on console if they go that route, especially the Nintendo Switch (which happens to be [in the hands of 55 million people](https://www.statista.com/statistics/687059/nintendo-switch-unit-sales-worldwide/)).\n9. **Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 Remaster -** Yeah, they are [remastering this shit](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21254430/tony-hawk-pro-skater-remaster-ps4-xbox-one-pc-release-date). You remember how badass these games were back in the day.  Set to release Sept, 2020. I actually think this might be a surprise revenue generator. It'll sell 25-35 million copies.\n10. **King Digital Entertainment -** [ATVI bought them](https://www.forbes.com/companies/king-digital-entertainment/#d7a79482ed68) for around 6 billion a few years back, and it's pretty clear that this was a wise purchase. Their suite of current games and upcoming games/expansions should continue to print money and at a good margin. They are a dominat player in the mobile space, and could leverage those users to try other games from ATVI (Diablo Immortal)\n11. **Tv show -** Pretty strong rumors that Blizzard is working on a [few TV shows](https://www.polygon.com/tv/2020/2/18/21142292/overwatch-diablo-netflix-animated-shows-blizzard-linkedin-leak) based on their Diablo and Overwatch worlds. Animated TV shows are [growing in popularity, even for adults.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2020/05/22/avatar-the-last-airbender-was-the-most-watched-show-on-netflix-this-week/#599046b05d9c) Both of these shows will attract ALL blizzard fans (100's of millions around the world), and lots of new people too, as I'm sure they'll make it easy enough to digest for someone who doesn't know the game/universes already. This could also bring brand new people into the *Blizziverse*. And I'm sure Netflix/HBO Max/Apple TV would be happy to pay a pretty penny for rights to it.\n\n# E-Sports -  The Future of 'sports' entertainment\n\nE-Sports will largely replace real sports in our lifetime, and we\u2019re just now really getting started. Disagree? Great, I don\u2019t give a fuck. Go ask any 10 year-old this question. \u201cHey little Johnny-Sue. Would you like to watch some sweaty dudes smash into each other for 3 hours, or would you rather watch your favorite team play in their respective competitive E-Sport league on Twitch?\u201d 9/10 times, Lil-fuckin-Johnny-Sue gonna pick video games, and that's a fact.\n\n**Teams and Orgs**\n\n[Esports are also BOOMING in colleges](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/02/06/why-the-rise-of-esports-is-good-for-schools-students-and-even-employers/#323f2a3c6f50), with lots of colleges offering significant scholarships to come play video games for their school. Let me help you draw a mental picture. *Concentrate.*\n\nRemember Lil-Fucking-Johnny-Sue from above? If he/she gets good enough at whatever game he/she is playing, they could get a full-ride scholarship to college, and then possibly get a job afterwards as a professional Esports athlete (and [make more money then a CPA](https://www.businessinsider.com/call-of-duty-league-teams-schedule-salary-rules-format-2019-11#call-of-duty-league-players-will-have-a-minimum-salary-of-50000-along-with-other-benefits-1) makes their first few years of working). THEN, when he/she gets too fucking old and slow to play the game (25-30 years old typically) they can become an analyst, caster, coach, manager, scout, etc etc. Maybe they become the next [N0tail](https://dotesports.com/business/news/top-earning-esports-players-21870) (highest paid Esports athlete to date) and make a cool 6.8 million a year. Imagine making 6 figures a year to play fucking video games and rekt n00bs on stage. Fuck I want that life so bad.\n\nThere are literally stadiums being filled with fans to watch people play video games, while another 100 million people watch from home. Esports organizations are becoming bigger and bigger. TSM is a major Esports organization in the US and they are building a [$50 million facility in LA](https://www.dailyesports.gg/tsm-announces-50-million-esports-facility-in-los-angeles/). [More words](https://www.oneesports.gg/features-and-opinions/5-of-the-worlds-most-over-the-top-esports-facilities/) on other organizations to help put things into perspective. While these facilities are clearly impressive, this is **nothing** compared to [major sports facilities](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/1211/the-5-most-expensive-stadiums-in-the-world.aspx).\n\nHere's my point. Is it reasonable to assume that these facilities/teams/Esports stadiums/orgs will continue to get bigger? And if they get bigger, they will [demand more attention](https://www.looper.com/44783/10-games-revolutionized-gaming/) from celebrities/rich folk because they want to get in on the action. As a result, the salaries of players/managers/staff/coaches/analysts will continue to go up and there will be more and more opportunities for jobs in this field. This then causes more young people to be more interested in video games, because not only are they fun af (and insanely addictive), but you could play pro someday! Schools/colleges will continue to develop competitive Esports teams because A: You better fucking believe that there are lots of kids out there that care about this and B: The school knows that it could lead to jobs (more like a dream job, but still something that's reasonable to consider if you are really good at a video game).\n\nStill disagree? More words for you to look at and not understand.\n\n[Blizzard Esports Revenue](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/03/12/things-know-activision-blizzard-1b-esports-deal.aspx)\n\nThere are competitive [(money generating) Esports leagues](https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-16-call-of-duty-esports-franchise-25-million.html) for 7 different ATVI games. (Overwatch, Hearthstone, WoW, COD, COD Warzone, COD Mobile, Starcraft). Here are some thoughts from Pete Vlastelica ([head of E-Sports at Blizzard](https://www.newsweek.com/activision-blizzard-esports-president-future-plans-overwatch-call-duty-league-1486570)).\n\nE-Sports will be 10x in 10 years. Bet your bottom dollar on it.\n\n# Technicals - (kinda, but only 1 cause fuck TA)\n\nHonestly, just fucking look at the 50-day moving average (image attached). They crashed and burned cause Rona (so did everything else you autist). But Rona has been canceled, and even if it hasn't, ATVI is gonna be better off because of it.\n\n**TL;DR** \\- ATVI makes a lot of money and they are in a strong position to grow and make lots more fucking cash regardless of C19/protests/riots and they might actually do even better because of it. (3 -12 months = 80's) (12-24 months = 90's.)\n\nYolo 100c mid-2021.\n\nEDIT: misspelled ATVI ticker one time in post and some autist called me out. Fixed. Also, fuck off.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8g6urh79oa451.png?width=2476&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfc5dc86d808439bbb5ff7612d2f40d86c0742e2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ry0jel79oa451.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f683884fc309d90803a24e3c32d1c626ef84cb0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qq32ek79oa451.png?width=596&format=png&auto=webp&s=11661a18e989e7fdf5fc94979f15fb64645d8907", "created_utc": 1591887149.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h10rw8/video_games_are_the_future_atvi_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
