People aren't spending a lot of money right now, sure. A lot of people lost their jobs, sure. But do you really think that even 20-30 million people who will probably lose their jobs won't get another one and won't go back to their previous spending habits once they do? In addition to the easy loans companies getting probably with some shitty loop hole I don't even know about yet you really think the S&P 500, the biggest companies - the ones most likely to get EASY fucking money from their friends at the fed - are going to go have a hard fucking time? Explain why you think we won't be back to near normal in 2 months and every single person who bought in right now bought good stocks at relatively good prices?\n\nDon't bet against the fucking fed, Market Makers already know they'll do anything to keep the market from falling. The game is rigged for stability, not your fucking puts.\n\nI have no fucking positions, I lost half my shit learning that I can't fucking do options in the past month. I bought UPRO and made 30% back in the past week because fuck these options sellers taking my fucking money. Fuck.  Ban me if I've broken some rule but FUCK OPTION SELLERS, sneaky \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udffb posting fucks.
