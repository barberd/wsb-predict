Don't necessarily follow this unless you're retarded or someone else can help vouch for it, but I'm trying to look into $EGHT (8x8), a company that deals with VOIP (like ZOOM) on a small business-level basis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll keep it bullet pointed to make it easy\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis company went up 5% today (5/11)\n\nTheir earnings are tomorrow AH.\n\nHaving looked through as many posts as I can find in regards to people discussing the product quality, it's rarely positive.\n\nI looked through the quarterly earnings and this is what I got from the previous two:\n\nSeptember 2019: MC 2379.342; Cash 232427; Debt 84426; Enterprise Value: -145622; Cash-Debt: 148001\n\nMore recently December 2019: MC 1946.702; C 291604; D 172903; EV: -116754; C-D: 118701\n\nSo my thinking is they're on a downward trend and are going to continue to not meet the current expectation tomorrow AH, leading to a correction from the current pump.\n\n**I'm not saying follow this,** but can someone help look at this with me to see if I'm on the right track about doing this?
