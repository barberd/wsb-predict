Might go for some cheap 140-150 strikes as well, depending on how touched by God I'm feeling. Like most plays, I'm sure this one can't possibly go tits up. \n\n$WYNN \n\nSo, for starters, I know fuck all about this company and how it is run, but I suspect a lot is not being priced in due to the shitty publicity around it. They got to keep their MA gaming licenses last night and the stock is having a nice day today. If this momentum carries into ER and earnings surprise I can see a pretty big move happening based on the chart. \n\nLooking at getting absolutely fucked by some 6/21 calls, probably 165-180 strikes. \n\n$ROKU \n\nFirst of all, fuck roku. I havent known anyone who owns one since 2010. This company basically doesn't exist for all I know, I've never even seen an ad for this shit.  With competition from the likes of Amazon and Apple, I just dont understand how they cant not lose market share from here on out. Mainly though, it's running up into earnings and that offends me. \n\nLooking at getting plowed by some 5/10 55 puts. Maybe some 5/31 45 puts if I'm feeling extra retarded. \n\n$GE \n\nHell yeah, baby. This stock fucking sucks, but I think its overdone and sentiment *seems* to be turning around in the short term. I think the movement from this ER should carry forward into the next, provided the market doesn't shit itself. \n\nI'm seriously considering losing money on various calls, 11.5-12.5 strikes, July and August exp. \n\nSuper shitty wild card picks: \n\nAMD 5/17 35c\nSQ 5/3 90c\nNVDA 5/17 230c\nATVI 5/31 70c", "created_utc": 1556735257, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bjkmmk/i_pick_downright_retarded_options_so_you_dont/", "is_self": true}
