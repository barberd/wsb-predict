Swapped to Xfinity and now have 10x faster internet FOR THE SAME PRICE. \n\nSo here I am today returning my AT&amp;T equipment through their returns partner, FedEx. It was a nice FedEx but big empty (DD of its own). AT&amp;T digital returns systems are slow so I\u2019m just standing here like an idiot pretending to text some friends I don\u2019t have. I quickly notice that the only thing on the back counters are AT&amp;T boxes. Nothing else. This a FedEx not a god damn AT&amp;T store. I ask \u201chey, how many of these returns do you guys do per day.\u201d 50. Per day. Incredible. Best part? AT&amp;T return system never loaded and manager came out and I swear to god said \u201cthey\u2019re experiencing a high volume of returns. It\u2019s overloading the system\u201d. Big short. \n\nThey couldn\u2019t even print me a receipt so I gave them my contact info and am already expecting to get into one of those \u201cwhy the fuck would I lie about returning your shitty boxes\u201d arguments in the next couple weeks.", "created_utc": 1575918225, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e8ebom/att_dd/", "is_self": true}
