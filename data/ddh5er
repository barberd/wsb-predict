All that matters is that the further from the underlying price your strike is the cheaper the option is. You probably believe that because you've never looked at the ITM options. That shit gets more expensive as it becomes more ITM -except it doesn't. At least it doesn't get more expensive at the same rate it gains intrinsic value. That extrinsic value that you hate about OTM options works in reverse when options are ITM.\n\nRemember how I told you to ignore Black Scholes? It's because option prices are set by morons like us who buy these things despite not having the faintest clue what we're doing. That means if you look, you can find opportunities to buy ITM options spreads for less than the net intrinsic value.\n\nExample:\n\nOn Monday I bought GE 9.5p and sold GE 9p. I paid .33 total. Today I closed the positions for 0.5, max profit. I literally bought $.5/contract for $0.33/contract.\n\nToday I picked up SPY 290c for 3.19 and sold SPY 293c for 1.14. Both expiry 10/7. Since I know you can't do math, that's $300 in equity per contract I just bought for $205. I'm already up 30% today alone - and it's all theta decay. \n\nNow I want to know, where you at Theta Gang? Where's the spread I can sell that risks $200 to make $100 with next day expiry? Am I your king now? I think I might be your king. \n\nTL;DR: Buy ITM option spreads, make money on theta.
