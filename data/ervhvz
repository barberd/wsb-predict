{"id": "ervhvz", "title": "Corona virus is a WYNN!", "selftext": "So the corona virus is spreading across Asia with cases confirmed in China, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and Thailand.  The virus is said to be similar to [SARS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome) to which we all know required our ladyboys to wear masks in late 2002 to 2003.\n\nDuring the SARS epidemic over 8000 people were infected and almost 800 died.  Mostly from mainland China.\n\nThis is the very early stages of the potential Corona Virus epidemic but WYNN and LVS have both dropped 6% this morning due to Wynn Resorts generating 75% of it's revenue from Macau and Las Vegas Sands generating 62%.  \n\nThe thing is, if we look back at the SARS epidemic, although there were 5,300 cases confirmed in China there was only 1 case in Macau and 0 deaths.  The epidemic lasted from November 2002 to July 2003.\n\nTime to buy some WYNN and LVS Nov20 calls boys.", "created_utc": 1579617499, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ervhvz/corona_virus_is_a_wynn/", "is_self": true}
