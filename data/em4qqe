I am seeking an F for FFFFM .. oh wait. Wrong board.  \n\nMoney, yes back to money...\n\nI was going to buy BRK.B so I could play bingo with Buffet. I did - one single B class share.  Going to Omaha this year!\n\nThen I decided on the following:\n\nI will accumulate 1.35 DIREXION Portfolio Plus shares every month as my new core holding.\n\nIf there is a significant drop in the SP500 I will but up all the 3x ETFs I can using margin and lines of credit.  BALLS TO THE WALL.  When everyone else is running away for forced to sell is when I will pick them up. Cheap.  As these are highly path dependent for success I think I lower my risk after a significant correction.  I will still have some decay if we go sideways for a while but I am willing to hold..\n\nBoring as shit right?", "created_utc": 1578544907, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/em4qqe/a_millionaires_strategy_for_2020_v01/", "is_self": true}
