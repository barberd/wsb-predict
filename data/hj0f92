{"id": "hj0f92", "title": "If you are long NKLA this is literally free money!!!", "selftext": "TL;DR: short sellers pay you about 8% a week and all you have to do is hold NKLA stock for them (of which they have the short counterpart).\n\nHow it works: Imagine you sell 1 at the money put and you also buy 1 call at the same strike price as the put you will basically buy 100 shares at the strike price at the expiration date what ever happens because if NKLA is below strike price, the sold put will force you to buy the 100 shares at the strike price and if NKLA ends up above the strike price u will execute your call option and buy 100 shares at the strike price.\n\nSo whatever happens, you get 100 shares at the strike price (current value). Now what if I tell you that the premium on the puts are higher than the ones on the calls, which means that by doing the above explained procedure you get money for buying the stock at the current price in one week. 300IQ\n\nExample: We both have $6750. You are an autist and buy 100 shares of NKLA for $6750\n\nI sell a cash covered put at the $67.50 strike for $10.50 (credit) and then buy a call same strike for $2.90. I have made $760 in premium. (real values taken from the option chain)\n\nAt June 10th I will (be forced to) buy 100 shares of NKLA for $6750 whatever happened. Then you will own 100 shares of NKLA but I will own 100 shares of NKLA and have made $750 in the process.\n\nWhat to do: Sell all your NKLA shares buy at the money calls and sell at the money puts for the same amount of shares. MAKE SURE YOU ARE USING CASH-COVERED PUTS AND NOT MARGIN!!! Enjoy free save money!\n\nDisclamers:\n\nThis is only risk free money relative to holding NKLA shares.\n\nIf you are not bullish on NKLA don't do this since you can still lose money if NKLA tanks more than 8% a week. It's just a better way of holding NKLA shares.\n\nEarly assignment is good for you since you can just sell your call and do the above again.
