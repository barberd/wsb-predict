Fair price of this thing is 0 and that's what it will eventually be worth. They will sell their assets and probably their subsidiaries too, any company interested in taking over is better off going to the bankruptcy yard sale and taking their pick there. Shareholders will be wiped off, DAX exclusion index is also coming this September.\n\nDisclaimer: No position yet, but I'm keeping an eye on a possible short if it gaps up again.\n\nEdit: price reached 4.60, so it basically halved again now.", "created_utc": 1593520225.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/himfzg/wirecard_just_halved_again/", "is_self": true}
