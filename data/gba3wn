MM\u2019s hate this trick!", "selftext": "See the below EOD prices:   \n\nStock price: $7.69  \n\nJan 2022 option prices:\n\n$7 put 4.20 / 6.70 (Bid/Ask)\n\n$7 call 2.48 / 4.85 (Bid/Ask)\n\n**Here\u2019s what you do**:\n\nSell stock   +7.69\n\nSell put       +4.20\n\nBuy call      -4.85\n\n**Total**: $7.04, -1 put, + 1 call.\n\n**Jan 2022**: you own the shares + 4 cents.  You win no matter what the stock does.\n\n**BUT**, in reality you could buy/sell the options for closer to the mid-point.  That would put you about $2.50 ahead, not 4 cents.\n\n**Explanation**: There\u2019s an arbitrage called put-call parity that keeps option prices in line.  Cost of shorting is one of the inputs.  That\u2019s where the $2.50 comes from ($2.50 uses the midpoint, which ignores the liquidity premium MM's get for being willing to take this bet and possibly be screwed over if it turns out you know what you\u2019re doing).  \n\nIf you\u2019re one of the rare breed willing to own this stock you might as well get paid for it.\n\n**Other fun facts**:\n\n* MM\u2019s are willing to pay \\~50% of the current stock price to lock in minimum $7/share in Jan 2022\n* MM\u2019s demand \\~90% of the current price to sell you the same (they won\u2019t hold the risk on their books and it\u2019s expensive to hedge)\n* For Jan 2021, someone\u2019s bidding $2.20 on a $3 strike put.  No takers.  MM\u2019s are asking $2.90 (to be fair, they probably just aren\u2019t paying attention; for some puts they\u2019re asking more than the strike).\n* The all-time intraday high is $28.84, on March 19, and it closed at $14.34.  It was only $2.28 on March 13.\n\nI own deep ITM puts and intend to hold for a while longer.  This may be a bad idea, there could be a short squeeze, or the threat of one could send the price up, or the company could get PPP loans and/or issue bonds to the Fed, or it could get acquired (I'm sure financial engineers are building masterpiece ShitCo's full of defaulted debt, disastrous leases and the short end of as many sticks as they can gather; maybe some of them would like to acquire some employees and a \"story\" to help them get a bailout).\n\n**TLDR**: if you want to own APRN, you\u2019d be better off owning it syntetically by selling bets against it.", "created_utc": 1588301324.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gba3wn/if_you_own_blue_apron_aprn_do_this_mms_hate_this/", "is_self": true}
