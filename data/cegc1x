Was thinking about YOLOing my whole account into $134 calls for 7/26.\n\nIs this a classic autist WAB move or nah? How does price usually move during these times? Anyone have any input on URI as a whole?", "created_utc": 1563386233, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cegc1x/united_rentals_earnings_report/", "is_self": true}
