Simply the greatest YOLO fund ever invented. Double Trippling down with extra juicy leverage\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; The Japanese company plans to lend up to $20 billion to its employees to  buy stakes in its second giant venture-capital fund, according to  people familiar with the matter. Mr. Son may account for more than half  of that amount, some of the people said. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; At $20 billion, the employee pool would represent nearly a fifth of the money that SoftBank [said last month ](https://group.softbank/en/corp/news/press/sb/2019/20190726_01/?mod=article_inline)it  had lined up for its second Vision Fund, a successor to a $100 billion  fund that launched in 2017 and is nearly spent. Adding in its own  contribution to the second fund of $38 billion, SoftBank could make up  more than half of the money raised, far more than is typical for a fund  sponsor. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; SoftBank announced it has $108 billion from investors including [Apple](https://quotes.wsj.com/AAPL)  Inc., [Microsoft](https://quotes.wsj.com/MSFT)  Corp. , the government of Kazakhstan and half a dozen banks. Those  commitments aren\u2019t binding and are being finalized during a tumultuous  stretch for startups, including some of the Vision Fund\u2019s largest  investments. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; But SoftBank is instead lending to staff\u2014it has about 400 employees\u2014to  buy those stakes. It did the same thing for the first fund, which now  includes about $8 billion of employee money, people familiar with the  matter said. The lending adds leverage to the fund\u2019s already risky  investments and highlights the unusually close relationship between  SoftBank and the fund. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Other investors in the fund include the government fund of  Kazakhstan, which is likely to contribute about $3 billion, people  familiar with the matter said. Banks including  [Goldman Sachs Group](https://quotes.wsj.com/GS)  Inc., Standard Chartered PLC and Japan\u2019s [Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group](https://quotes.wsj.com/MUFG)  Inc. have signaled they are willing to invest several hundred million  dollars apiece, which bankers view as a way to get hired on deals and  IPOs for Vision Fund\u2019s portfolio companies.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;SoftBank is  negotiating with several pensions and insurers, including in Taiwan, for  combined investments it hopes will exceed $30 billion, some of the  people said. Taiwan\u2019s insurers are searching for higher-yielding  investments to help them close the gap between promised payouts for  older policies and returns they are getting on investments now.\n\nSo $20B for 400 empoyees means a nice $50m loan per person, obviosly not equal wheighting in reality but still, that's a lot of leverage for an unknown amount of collateral, if there even is one. \n\nSource: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-to-lend-founder-and-employees-billions-to-invest-in-fund-11566051247?mod=rsswn](https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-to-lend-founder-and-employees-billions-to-invest-in-fund-11566051247?mod=rsswn)\n\nExtra: \n\n&gt;Shares of [Uber Technologies](https://quotes.wsj.com/UBER)  Inc.  have fallen 30% since the company went public in May. The stock  now trades below the roughly $35 level that SoftBank paid to acquire its  stake, according to people familiar with the matter.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;WeWork,  another big Vision Fund investment, filed this week to go public,  disclosing losses that are enormous and growing fast, even by Silicon  Valley standards. It will need large sums of cash for years as it builds  out offices, which could affect its most recent $47 billion valuation,  which [one analyst called \u201cvery hard to swallow\u201d](https://www.wsj.com/articles/stopping-the-red-ink-tops-weworks-to-do-list-11565881081?mod=article_inline) in light of the company\u2019s huge losses.\n\nIt's no coincidence, Analfarmer2 must be their best employee.", "created_utc": 1566066318, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/crpwmv/wsj_softbank_to_lend_founder_and_employees_20/", "is_self": true}
