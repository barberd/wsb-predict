SDC now brings a $2.8 billion dollar defamation suit against NBC news. Did I mention they\u2019re attorney bringing the suit is the same one that was successful against Walt Disney in a $1 billion dollar suit for a beef company that was defamed by Disney for selling \u201cpink slime\u201d... back the truck up boys. This might not be the traditional buy high sell low opportunity we are often presented with here, but hold SDC for a while and I\u2019ll bet you seem 10x free tendies.
