{"id": "e9bbsn", "title": "PTON Short Interest and Borrow Rates Update", "selftext": "Short interest on S3 was reported to be 70.4%, the highest since mid November. Finally we are seeing shorts running out of available shares. On IB, they are reporting they have 0 available shares to short. This was down from about 500k last week and about 1.9m 3 weeks ago. Occasionally we've seen 20-60k shares come available, but they pretty much get swallowed up as soon as they become available. This is GOOD. This is what we want to see because once there are not more available shares to short, the borrow rate starts to rise....\n\nWhich has already started happening... yesterday the IB short borrow rate on PTON was about 5-6%. Currently it is 9.8% and has been slowly rising all day. It typically makes its biggest moves after the trading day so its good to see it rising mid-day as well. That is the recipe for a squeeze. \n\nI added to my Jan 17th $35 and $50 calls. I haven't sold any. But just because I have the risk tolerance for this trade DOES NOT mean you should follow me. This is a high risk/high reward trade and it has a high likelihood of being a bust. Please keep that in mind when you think about following some idiot you read on the Internet like me. \n\nAs to upcoming catalysts? The CEO is speaking at a conference today at 4:30pm. They might announce a new product (rowing machine would be nice), people might realize that their delivery people are busy as hell, etc. I don't know what the catalyst might be- but the keg is full of gunpowder and now we just need a match to light it. Maybe an increasing borrow rate might light it?", "created_utc": 1576090602, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e9bbsn/pton_short_interest_and_borrow_rates_update/", "is_self": true}
