{"id": "cg7r97", "title": "Completely new to investing, any tips?", "selftext": "Hey guys, I've been following this subreddit for a short time and only began investing this past thursday on Robinhood. Wondering if anybody has any helpful tips for a new person to all of this investing, new to Robinhood.   \n\n\nAfter some stupid decisionmaking as a young adult I have just recently finally completely paid off all my debt (yay) and have started to look at ways of potentially investing my money. I have decided to set up an account with Robinhood and deposited \\~100$ or so into it, I've also been recruiting all my friends to try to use my referral code (maybe a little too much). How should I go about trying to grow my portfolio with a low starting amount?   \n\n\nI'm hoping there is lots of you in here that have started just like myself and have learned some valuable stuff throughout your journeys that perhaps you'd be willing to share with a person just getting into all of this. Maybe some of you are Robinhood pros and could give me some pointers about the website/app as I'm still trying to get a hang of it as well.   \n\n\nPS: Ill also PM afilliate code if you want to help that way :D", "created_utc": 1563764379, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cg7r97/completely_new_to_investing_any_tips/", "is_self": true}
