If you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about I had a nice little story yesterday how I had $13700 went down $600 and yolo\u2019d the last of it on Netflix er. \n\nSo here is my next play. let me know what you think. I plan on going all in on both calls and puts for WDC 7/19 (expires tomorrow). They are pretty cheap rn and I think it could be a good play here\u2019s why.\n\nI\u2019m hoping for volatility. If it moves a little over 1% percent I\u2019m breaking even anything after that is gains. WDC has been extremely volatile recently and I figure since msft earnings are today if it goes to the moon WDC will follow. If msft sinks so will WDC. So I\u2019m expecting WDC to be more volatile tomorrow and the options are pretty cheap obviously. \n\nWhat do y\u2019all think?", "created_utc": 1563476815, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cewr4n/smart_play_or_stupid/", "is_self": true}
