Prepare for shit earnings Q1 earnings too!", "selftext": "Because the last quarterly earnings were historically not shit, I suspect their Q1 report will be absolute garbage because there is no way they can do the same trick as they did in Q4-2018. They did add some optimization for Android recently but I don't know how that's going to crawl it back for them, as I suspect it won't have that big of an influence on their earnings. My autism senses say Q1 will be a shit show and that Q2 will be quite shit if not just as shit as Q1. Seen as SNAP is at 11 bucks now, ITM Put options for next week Friday will probably be the best bet on them. Prepare for tendies my fellow autists! *literally can't go tits up...*", "created_utc": 1555501727, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/be6tir/snap_just_added_a_new_shit_inchat_game_function/", "is_self": true}
