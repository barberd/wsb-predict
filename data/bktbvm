Stop with your humdrum, never read any business news, don't know a thing about tech whining. \n\nFor a long time, Apple was a hardware company mostly. It had software, which was an operating system that was installed on the Macintosh computer. Over time, innovators like Steve Jobs helped the company create the iPod, the iPod Touch, the iPhone, etc. Along with that came a \"services\" ecosystem. These are softwares that are not just the operating systems of the devices, but things that run on them, Software as a Service. or SAAS, I think it's called. These are things like Apple Music, iTunes, Maps, facemojis or whatever that's called, the watch OS, autonomous tech, SIRI, and stuff like that.\n\nWhat's happening with Apple is that they are at peak mobile technology. They have realised that you can make mo re mobile phones, but if you did, you would ruin the Apple brand name, because you would be forced to make compromises on performance and design.\n\nInstead, you start making a lot of peripherals that use SAAS, and then -- AND THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART THAT PEOPLE FORGET -- you start pushing your software services on to non-Apple devices.\n\nSo, basically Apple is taking its vertical integrated software and hardware silo and while it is innovating within this silo in Apple's ecosystem, it is now pushing that software / services out into other devices, like Android devices.\n\nYou have about 4 million paying apple music subscribers on Android devices, and about 40 million Android devices right now that have some form of Apple music on them, but they are not subscribers.\n\nSo, if you think about it, Apple stands to make a huge amount of profit from having its systems on other devices, and that is why, in my view, they are trying to bill themselves as a services company.\n\nThey are administering and delivering a Software as a service to the non-Apple ecosystem.\n\nWith this are also moonshots like autonomous driving software and cars, etc. You may see them make more acquisitions here.\n\nI have bought tonnes of Apple stock on weakness and this cynical belief that somehow Apple is failing. And I think people are going to be surprised. People are way too focused on the first generation of apple as an exclusive hardware brand and not at all knowledgeable about their innovations in software design and innovations in AR, etc.", "created_utc": 1557026969, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bktbvm/view_all_systems_go_nonapple_devices_services/", "is_self": true}
