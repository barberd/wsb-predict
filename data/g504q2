Saudi Aramco and uncle Vlad added a new feature that will once again allow you infinite tendies. It works like this:\n\n1. Buy 100 contracts of CLK20 May Crude futures at -$35\n2. Buying power increases by $3.5MM because math\n3. Use said buying power to SLAP the fuckin ask on UVXY May 15 $70 C's\n4. Call up the WTI delivery facility and tell them \"you'll be there soon\"\n5. Cash out your UVXY tendies. Use profits to buy 20 acres in Texas, 42,000 above ground pools\n6. Sell 100 June CL contracts\n7. Deliver pool oil to the next guy\n\nBoom, you're rich.
