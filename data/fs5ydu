We all think that because we can halfway understand a DD on WSB and see that the news is \u2018really bad\u2019 we\u2019ll be in the next Big Short. \n\nRemember, Michael Burry fucking INVENTED A NEW FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT to short housing.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious right now that according to all \u2018logic\u2019 stonks should still go down. Well, you can bet your ass Wall Street knows step-by-step how and when everything will play out and makes their plays long before we do. Now, they know it\u2019s our turn and we\u2019ll try to make the same plays with our beer money while on lockdown. It\u2019s like they\u2019re playing poker but see everyone\u2019s hand.\n\nNow all you have is retards running back and forth calling, putting, yolo-ing, brrrr-ing, but most of all GUH-ing. \n\nIt\u2019s like waiting in airport security. You think you\u2019re gonna be slick slipping into the \u201cshorter\u201d lane then when you look back that family of 8 has cleared TSA before you get coronavirus spat on your boarding pass. \n\nTLDR; Wall Street knows it all way before your do. No matter how smart we think we are the best we can do is leech off their moves.", "created_utc": 1585627092.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fs5ydu/wall_street_knows_your_next_move_retard/", "is_self": true}
