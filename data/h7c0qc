{"id": "h7c0qc", "title": "$ROPE play?", "selftext": "TLDR: If you want to gamble on death: SCI 18SEP $40 Calls. \n\nWhile I was looking for a decent $ROPE to hang myself with after the close today, I had an epiphany: there has to be a way to make a play on COVID + the impending Robin Hood induced suicides that are likely when woke millennials start getting margin calls and realize they\u2019re moving back into mom\u2019s basement (or will be there for another decade).\n\nAfter some minimal scanning, I find Service Corporation International (SCI). I immediately think of Prestige Worldwide but I digress. Pretty covert name for a company that provides \u201cdeathcare\u201d products and services in the United States and Canada. As of December 31, 2019, it owned and operated 1,471 funeral service locations; and 482 cemeteries, including 290 funeral service/cemetery combination locations covering 44 states, 8 Canadian provinces, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. \n\nAccording to their last earnings call (https://seeking alpha.com/article/4341863-service-corporation-international-sci-ceo-thomas-ryan-on-q1-2020-results-earnings-call) the lockdown caught them off guard and they took a hit but they adapted by integrating virtual services into traditional services. Business, unfortunately, is increasing. From the 01 May transcript:\n\n- In the New York, New Jersey area over the last 3 weeks, we have brought in over 100 funeral service professionals who volunteered from around the country to assist our local teams in taking care of our families. Additionally, as the cemeteries and crematories have been overwhelmed, we brought in 23 additional refrigeration units, leveraging storage capacity to help relieve an overwhelmed system.\n\n- From an operating performance perspective, we have been privileged to serve over 5,400 COVID-19 deceased and their families today.\n\nThis stock dropped from a high of $52.33 in early March to a low of $33.93 and has barely budged. There is no way POTUS will agree to shut down the economy again as November draws near and social distancing has gone out the window (just ask the woke people in the \u201cCapitol Hill Autonomous Zone\u201d). Also take into account that: \n\n1.) Funerals will return back to the old normal\n\n2.) The backlog of postponed funerals will happen over next few months\n\n3.) COVID \u201cpart deux\u201d will likely overrun the rest of us and kill another several hundred thousand people\n\n4.) Panicked investors will desperately seek out \u201crecession proof\u201d plays and might be drawn to the fact that nothing is certain but death and taxes...and stocks that are selling at a 28% discount to their intrinsic values. \n\nI\u2019m buying 18SEP $40 Calls at the open tomorrow before I explain to my wife why our kids are going to a community college in 15 years. Maybe she\u2019ll kill me and the calls will print enough to cover my services. IDK.
