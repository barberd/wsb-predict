{"id": "fflujq", "title": "Switching from RH to WeBull...any feedback about it?", "selftext": "Even before RH messed up I've been thinking about switching to have better tools. My profolio is well over $25k so I would be able to use margin and day trade on all platforms. I have a TD and Fidelity account but I don't like the mobile apps and Fidelity will not approve me for options. (Which is all I trade now except long term investments I keep in separate accounts) WeBull looks like they have great tools and I already have the app. I've gotten used to how simple RH is and like the UI. I just don't want to switch between apps anymore to look at charts and other tools then back to RH to execute trades.\n\nLooking for experiences with find settlement and margin accounts.\n\nHow quickly can I use the funds after a sale? How many day trades are allowed on margin account/cash account assuming the account remains above $25k the whole time? (Systematically, I'm aware you can trade an \"unlimited\" in theory over $25k) Anything extremely different from RH or that I should be aware of?", "created_utc": 1583712637, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fflujq/switching_from_rh_to_webullany_feedback_about_it/", "is_self": true}
