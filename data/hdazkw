This led me to invest heavily in new cookware. Analysis of  Williams Sonoma also makes me very bullish on the cookware market.\n\nBoys and Gentlemen,\nI present to you the stock of Helen of Troy, HELE. Helen of Troy will release earnings for the period from March 1, 2020 to May 31, 2020 on July 8.\n\nHelen of Troy is a small cap conglomerate consumer goods company with 3 product focuses: healthcare, cookware and beauty. \n\nHelen of Troy licenses the Braun name to sell their home thermometers under. Meaning the skyrocketing thermometer sales benefit PG only from licensing revenue. They manufacture the thermometers in both China and Mexico and they make the disposable tip covers in the US. Since the pandemic began, they have increased manufacturing in Mexico dramatically. The CEO made clear on the last earnings call for the period ending feb. 29, 2020, that investors should not think that because you cannot but a thermometer anywhere online that they are not selling any. He stated that they are making and selling more than they ever have, but they are working directly with government, health systems and businesses to place them in the marketplace in the most efficient way possible. BULLISH.\n\nSecond, the company sells premium cookware under the OXO brand which manufactures a significant amount of its product in the USA. The OXO brand is sold by Williams Sonoma, Bed Bath Beyond and others. I purchased more than $600 worth of cookware during quarantine, about half of that was branded OXO. The pan that I ordered directly from OXO took 2 weeks to ship due to overwhelming order volume. \n\nThird, the beauty division. Helen of Troy sells haircare products under the DryBar brand. This segment is likely to see some decline due to declining revenue from salons and women working from home spending less time pampering themselves. I firmly believe, however, that this decline will be more than offset by the sales of cookware and thermometers. \n\nThe stock is currently trading at an approximate 10% discount to its ATH of $198.51.\n\nTLDR: Helen of Troy makes Braun thermometers and OXO cookware and they will have record earnings on July 8th.", "created_utc": 1592761197.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hdazkw/thermometers_cookware_bullish/", "is_self": true}
