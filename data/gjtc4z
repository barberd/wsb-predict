Well look no further than Wells Fargo the perennial loser about financials.   The financials , represented by XLF, are not beloved right now as they are being slammed by lower interest rates and also stricter loan requirements in everything from home loans to autos.  \n\nIt is one of the weakest among the primary dealers - exceeded only by Deustcheland Bank whose woes are a topic for another discussion- so if you include only American banks then it is #1 on the list.  \n\nThe stock has been under pressure due to dividend cut fears.  The concerns about a dividend cut has hit Wells Fargo particularly hard because it has one of the highest payout ratios among banks making it beloved by Boomers and fund managers.  Wells Fargo's current annual dividend rate of $2.08 a share implies a dividend yield of 8.48%. That compares with the yield for the financial XLF of 2.87% and the implied yield for the S&P 500 index of 2.05%, according to FactSet.   This is not sustainable.    If capital is an issue (which it is at any business) then it makes sense to save it instead of spending it on investors.\n\nWFC has also been up today on rumors that GS will buy them out.  Unfortunately for WFC bulls I find that unlikely b/c market cap deposit restrictions imposed by the FDIC.   Here is an analyst's words on it:  \n\n *02:38 PM EDT, 05/14/2020 (MT Newswires) -- Speculation that Wells Fargo (WFC) and Goldman Sachs (GS) may merge sent shares of Wells Fargo up 6.5% in afternoon trading, however, the speculation is a \"non-starter,\" according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) analyst Vivek Juneja, Business Insider reported.*     \n\n*Business Insider reported that in a note on Thursday, Juneja said that the combined deposit market share of the two banks would go past the regulatory limit. In a separate report, MarketWatch said Juneja reiterated his underweight rating on the stock and said a takeover by a bank of Wells Fargo would be \"banned by law.\"*     \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, WFC has bounced back today in intra-day trading ( so far to around 8.5-9%). The stock had plunged 24.9% during a 10-day stretch in which it fell nine times, to close Wednesday at the lowest price since June 2009.             \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Chalkin Money Flow captures institutional selling of WFC shares as fund managers continue to dump it.
