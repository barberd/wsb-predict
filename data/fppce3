{"id": "fppce3", "title": "Why DIS is Screwed", "selftext": "  \n\nWhy DIS is seriously fucked! According to FactSet, 87% of DIS revenue comes from its Consumer Services. 31% of that is related to its hospitality services such as hotels and amusement parks. We all know why that segment fucked so there\u2019s no need to explain. Parks closed = no money. Even if beer virus were to have a cure, it\u2019ll take years for the park to regain attendance. \n\nThe remaining 56% is its Media and Publishing services which comprises of 2 segments: Television cable & Broadcast Networks (40%), so like the ESPN, ABC, etc and Video Entertainment (16%) Pixar, Marvel films. Because of the rise in cord cutting, they\u2019ve been declining in that segment for the past 5-8 years, which led them to want to make Disney Plus. Despite Disney Plus doing well in subscribers, they are still losing money in that segment and its still relatively small, any subscriber growth in that aren\u2019t going to move the needle. \n\nRegarding their revenues for films, all their recent movies were basically delayed because aint nobody going to theaters now. Fear will persist and attendances will only slowly be regained. Also, the current filming production that they were working on or planning are also delayed or cancelled. This is going to cause a huge slowdown regarding upcoming releases. There\u2019s no fucking way they do well this upcoming earnings release on May. 62% of their revenue is in the US and this virus shit is just getting started as Trump is as incompetent as our fellow autists. We are just going to continue our quarantine longer and longer. People are severely underestimating how the economic impact and fear will sustain much longer. \n\nSo, closing statement: PUTS PUTS PUTS!\n\nFor all you retards saying this is priced in and have been the case for the past month it\u2019s obviously not since SPY and DIS decline since Feb 20 has roughly been the same around 23%. DIS should be far worst. \n\nClarification: The 56% and the 31% is in regards to the Consumer Service segment.", "created_utc": 1585277680.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fppce3/why_dis_is_screwed/", "is_self": true}
