{"id": "gako3t", "title": "Some TA on AMD here. I was initially looking for bear signs but I might have found some bull.", "selftext": " As I said, I was running a real quick TA on AMD (which is why this is on Robinhood) looking for bearish signs, with the blue MA at 25 and the yellow at 40. When looking at box 1 just after the 25 MA intercepts the 40 MA downward, there is a resemblance of a tweezer bottom followed by a dragonfly doji kicking off a reversal into an upward trend. If you look at box 2, the 25 MA is again beginning to intercept the 40 MA, and just below it is the same tweezer pattern followed by a dragonfly dojo pointing towards a possible continuation of another upward trend. Please leave any input you might have on this. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/GwhB7o3", "created_utc": 1588204059.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gako3t/some_ta_on_amd_here_i_was_initially_looking_for/", "is_self": true}
