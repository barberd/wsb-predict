Our next business venture is actually moving to webcams since a lot of big boys will be working from home all year (hint hint LOGI.)\n\nHPQ is already mooning as you can tell. Now is the time to get in a week before earnings. You've already seen other posts about HPQ plays but let this be the deciding factor for you.\n\nHP has also been almost completely out of stock on their website too insinuating that the demand is definitely there. I imagine at this point during the pandemic sales will be slowing down substantially.\n\nTake advantage of the week and sell next week when volatility is even higher.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n17c 5/29 17.5 6/12", "created_utc": 1589907900.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gmsld2/memes_and_bullshit_aside_hpq_is_the_way/", "is_self": true}
