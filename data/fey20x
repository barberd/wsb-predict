The 400 people tested, per CDC rules, are likely people that are at the highest risk - i.e. symptomatic/hospitalized/known contacts with COVID-19 patients. They are testing the highest risk groups first, and the finding that 93% - 95% of them do NOT have the virus has me pretty optimistic!", "created_utc": 1583601149, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fey20x/covid19_testing_at_university_of_washington_57/", "is_self": true}
