CNBC level DD inside (going full retard)", "selftext": "CNBC reports, from unnamed sources within the Trump administration, that next Friday we can expect a major announcement and possible completion of the trade deal with China.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn case you didn't happen to be watching, that news leaked less than 30 minutes prior to the Fed announcement and subsequent press conference.  Coincidence?  Nope.  Trump gets briefed on Fed decision, knows that markets are expecting an ultra-dovish statement (we got neutral instead) and suddenly a mysterious source \"leaks\" that we're about to have a trade deal.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wouldn't panic sell just yet folks.  Add some hedges to your portfolio but Trump is gonna let Kudlow out of his cage tonight to hit all the news stations tomorrow morning guaranteed.  We'll get one last pump to get close to retouching highs and then the real correction will start.", "created_utc": 1556746061, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bjmqvk/market_will_retouch_highs_and_then_plummet_cnbc/", "is_self": true}
