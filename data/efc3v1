I have a question about what kind of option trading considered as day trading and is limited by PDT rule.\n\nScenario1: sell to open a call option and then buy it back same day. Does this falls into PDT rule?\n\nScenario2: buy to open a call option on day1, then on day2 sell it, then at same day2 buy to open the same call option. What about this?\n\nScenario3: opposite of scenario 2, sell to open a call option on day1, then on day2 buy it back, then at same day2 sell to open the same call option again. What about this?", "created_utc": 1577248985, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/efc3v1/question_about_pdt_rule_for_options/", "is_self": true}
