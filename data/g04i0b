Some analysts cautioned, though, that details of the accord may already have been priced in to stock prices.\n\n**Not a big enough cut.**\n\n>If it was a bigger cut \u201cthen you would\u2019ve seen oil prices strengthen to $30 very quickly and that would be helpful for equity markets but we didn\u2019t get that,\u201d said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities.  \n>  \n>If the global economy stays closed for another few months \u201cthis 9.7 million reduction will be meaningless because people aren\u2019t driving,\u201d Cardillo said.\n\n**Generally a good news though, so there should be a green Monday:**\n\n>\u201cThe broader market will see this as another point of stabilization as the economy, primed by favorable fiscal and monetary policies, seems to be avoiding the worst case market scenarios,\u201d said Meckler, a partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Jersey\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**And Speculation on why the market isn't giving two fucks about bailouts** ([Source](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-fed-moralhazard-an/seen-everywhere-in-last-u-s-crisis-moral-hazard-is-nowhere-in-this-one-idUSKCN21U0GV))\n\n>As the U.S. Federal Reserve rolls out trillions of dollars to blunt the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, there\u2019s a notable difference to the last financial crisis: close to zero concern over \u201cmoral hazard\u201d - the sticky business of bailing out those whose dilemma is of their own making.\n\n**People don't gaf:**\n\n>\u201cPeople are undertaking sacrifices for the common good. We need to make them whole. To the extent we have the ability to make them whole we should be doing that as a society,\u201d Powell said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t cause this.\u00a0Their business isn\u2019t closed because of anything they did wrong. They didn\u2019t lose their job because of anything they did wrong.\u201d\n\n**Bailout is the way even if some shit companies get rescued:**\n\n>The Fed\u2019s programs may end up helping some businesses whose trouble is at least partly of their own making - having loaded up on debt before the crisis, for instance. But for the moment, neither Fed policymakers nor politicians seem too concerned with separating the deserving from the less so.\n\n**AND PERHAPS THE MOST TELLING SIGN THAT JPOW DOESN'T GIVE A SINGLE FUCK:**\n\n>\u201cI worry that in hindsight, you will see that we could have done things differently, but one thing I don\u2019t worry about is inflation right now,\u201d Powell said.", "created_utc": 1586724556.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g04i0b/speculation_around_opec_deal_and_what_it_can_mean/", "is_self": true}
