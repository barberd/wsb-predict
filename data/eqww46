Long time lurker here finally emerging from the shadows to ask a question that will definitely place me deep on the spectrum. \n\nBefore I do, I want to start off with an obligatory thank you for getting me hooked on this shit like a heroin junkie. For me, it all started when I saw king of the dry dicks GUH on the front page because \u201cIV crush is priced in\u201d. Ever since then, I started investigating how such a large group of individuals all missing chromosomes could find each other in one spot. Next thing you know I\u2019m watching option videos and reading shit posts and it feels like I went back in time and dosed an extra round of vaccinations when I was a kid...l could feel the autism coursing through my veins and voices in my head telling me to buy SPY FDs. \n\nAnyways back to my retarded question... if I buy a call that ends up being ITM, but still has a lot of time before expiration, do you make more money selling it right away to avoid theta decay or do you make more by holding it (stocks always go up)?\n\nExample:\nBought: MSFT on 1/2, 155,strike 11.85 premium, expiring 6/19 (yes, I\u2019m a cuck)\nSold: 1/9, premium 13.15 (yes, very gay)\n\nRight now obviously shows I should have held (16.70 premium), but is this usually a good strategy?\n\nThanks in advance for not answering my question and fuck the bears", "created_utc": 1579444190, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eqww46/newcomer_with_retarded_options_question/", "is_self": true}
