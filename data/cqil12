We all know \"algos\" trade the market and we feed those algos. As we go lower in the SP500, DOW, there will be mentions of \"buying the dip.\"\n\nAlgos will read this information \"buy the dip.\" Now algos are way more complex than we understand, and as a HTML coder myself with vast experience I can tell you these algos are going to buy $PEP.\n\nWhy? Well lets think like an algo for a second. When advanced algos reads \"buy the dip\" it will obviously search for who is selling the dip. Now the most common type of dip type is cheese, and we all love Tostitos. $PEP makes not only the tortillas but they have various other dips. \n\nCan't go tits up.", "created_utc": 1565829506, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cqil12/long_pep_or_regret_it_later_but_the_dip/", "is_self": true}
