{"id": "gvmf01", "title": "Zoom Technology: Post ER Analysis", "selftext": "TLDR: The numbers don't add up + 2021 guidance is complete garbage + standing firm on my previous prediction that ZM will correct 30% by mid June. Zoom is just a Skype rebrand, no proprietary technology, no integration, generic UI. \n\nReport Revenue: 328M\n\nReports that 88% of revenue comes from Enterprises, meaning 288M came from these businesses.\n\nReported Enterprise Users: 275,000\n\nThe Math:\n\nCost of enterprise plan - $19.99 per host/per month\n\nGiven that the 275,000 enterprise customers consist of companies with 10+ employees, lets say the ratio of host to employees is 1 host per 10 employees. Seems fair?\n\nNow lets assume that the average # of employees for these 275,000 accounts is 100 employees. Seems fair right? JPM Data for 2014 finds that 99% of American businesses are small businesses and 88% of that employs less than 20 employees. Based on my approximation of 100 employees on average, that would be 10 hosts per company or $199.90 per company/per month.\n\nSo, 275,000 accounts x $199.90 x 3 months for the quarter = \\~165M\n\n165M is pretty far off from 288M, no? Maybe they rounded up or something.\n\nBut wait, they also said 768 customers contribute 100K for a 12-month trailing revenue. So... that's an additional 76.8M in revenue.\n\n2 problems here: 1) they said these customers are not adjusted into the revenue since these are trailing (or extrapolated) numbers assuming they don't cancel their subscription.\n\n2) Even if we add the 76.8M, we are still short $46.2M.\n\nIf you're still following the math at this point, congrats!\n\nHere's the second part of this analysis and it has to do with it's outrageous guidance. Their CFO said they are estimating \"conservatively\" in their guidance, but they somehow suddenly doubled their forward 2021 guidance from $900M to $1.8B. Yes, you didn't read that wrong. $1.8B is their estimated 2021 \"conservative\" guidance. Does this remind you of any company that did this type of magic math when their underlying value increased by 200% in the month? Tilray anyone?\n\nWe are at a point where the peak pandemic is over and people can care less about getting infected at this point because their UI claims are running dry and they have to go back to work soon. Conveniently, Google hangouts/meets + Cisco Webex + Microsoft Teams among others are competing for their lion's share of this space. Here's the difference: They all have integrated technology that can link applications and they are also free. Teams and Google are also significantly safer from a security standpoint. Tech companies are also mainly using Teams. That leaves that 275,000 customers most likely small businesses with much fewer than 100 average employees.\n\nThe point is that Zoom will NEVER be able to hit 1.8B in revenue unless COVID-19 kills 1 million people overnight, Kim Jong Jun says he will be hosting his deathbed message on Zoom, a 5-year shelter in place is effective immediately, and they start pimping Zoom employees as escorts.\n\nThey are down in AH btw.
