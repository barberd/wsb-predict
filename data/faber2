{"id": "faber2", "title": "Beer Virus Report from Tokyo", "selftext": "I\u2019m living in Tokyo and wanted to give y\u2019all a update on what\u2019s it\u2019s like in Japan with regards to the beer virus. \n\nThere is absolutely ZERO masks available anywhere and neither are there any hand sanitizers. Japan has been relying on China to supply the masks but with what\u2019s going over there, it is safe to say we won\u2019t be getting any mask anytime soon. Anyone that has been to Tokyo knows how PACKED the trains get. To make matters worse, most companies are run by old men who refuse to allow their employees telework.\n\nThe gov has been busy trying to downplay the situation to safe the olympics and even refusing to test people with symptoms. Their logic is that if they don\u2019t test, there isn\u2019t a positive results, which will help keep the infection count low. Everyday there are dozens of new cases popping up but most of which they have no clue from where and from whom it was passed from. Official count now is at 200 but is NOWHERE NEAR the actual count. I am certain this is wide spread amongst the general population. \n\nNikkei has been hammered last three sessions but this is still the beginning. PUTs on Nikkei225 or Topix or anything Japanese for the matter!", "created_utc": 1582806694, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/faber2/beer_virus_report_from_tokyo/", "is_self": true}
