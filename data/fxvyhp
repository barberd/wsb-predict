And the market has reacted with some noted gains across the DOW and S&P500.\n\nThose gains seemed light however and so some rather rapid investigation went on between myself and several other investors.  Here's what we found and our conclusions behind the data points below.\n\n1. GOLD is up... 2.75% to $1,692   Gold stocks GLD 2.5% and NEW 9.8%  \\*SLV - 3.37% for the curious\n2. Inflation protected bonds - TIPS is up 1.1%\n3. REITS and real estate related stocks are significantly up   SAFE - 8.85% PLD - 6.36% EPRT - 20.24% MCD - 3.67% \\*Burgers and Land\n\nNow the Fed has just notified the market that they will directly invest in investment grade ETF's HYG, and LQD.  They have moved into the Junk Bond territory and Risk ratings are being thrown out the window.  Or in short... The Fed has announced they'll pay for just about anything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's where we started thinking or at least interpreting how a Money Manager is approaching the situation.\n\n1. I can clear my books of this crap at a premium price\n2. However, I need to move out of Dollars because the Fed will just keep printing.\n3. The music has to stop... but that only would happen if the Administration changes or the election has already occurred.\n\nGiven this thoughtline... looking at the prices of real estate, gold, and inflation protected bonds we came to the conclusion that the smart money was already moving to protect itself from the FED PRINT BUS running their investments into the ground.\n\nIn short... we moved all our puts to post election and just bought into REIT and GOLD calls.\n\nPlay as you may... this ship is already sinking and the Rats are spending today to clean their books.\n\nTLDR: $200P SPY NOV, $65C NEW JUNE", "created_utc": 1586451169.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxvyhp/where_i_think_the_smart_money_just_went/", "is_self": true}
