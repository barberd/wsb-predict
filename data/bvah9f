AMD and ARM unaffected", "selftext": "[source](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12701) \n\n(Same researchers as Spectre/Meltdown) \n\nTL;DR, despite the hardware mitigation on Coffee Lake Intel processors remain vulnerable to out-of-order and speculative execution bugs that can allow untrusted code to gain system access. Unclear if Ice Lake is affected. \n\nIn my opinion as an ECE I think there is a shot of Ryzen 3 beating Ice Lake once all the hardware/software mitigations imposed by the OS's and Intel to deal with all this. Intel has been an industry leader in single threaded performance largely due to their OoE secret sauce and deep instruction pipelines - now these vulnerabilities are negating their advantageous position. With lower clock speeds, larger die size, and fewer cores I would not be surprised if AMD beats Intel in real world benchmarks with same generation processors. \n\nTL;DR you fuckers who sold me $26 puts on AMD got me good", "created_utc": 1559324083, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bvah9f/new_intel_security_flaw_amd_and_arm_unaffected/", "is_self": true}
