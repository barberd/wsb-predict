Now, what would Elon do next with Tesla? I say, set a trap for the people he hates. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTesla has been one of the most shorted companies over the last years and [Elon is tired of it](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-16/musk-calls-tesla-most-shorted-stock-ever-technically-it-s-not). The amount of [pure bullshit](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/06/04/teslas-going-to-have-to-restructure-says-blaine-capital.html) the bears have been spreading has been insane. With the expiring tax credits, he knew long in advance that Q1 2019 would be a relatively bad quarter.  He played this by first lessening profits in Q4 of 2018 by increasing CAPEX. He then kept up CAPEX and production in Q1 and had over [10 000 cars](https://ir.tesla.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tesla-q1-2019-vehicle-production-deliveries) in transit at the end of the quarter. All to make a loss and make it look like demand was waning. You all know the stock was pushed down to $178 with shorts at more than 30% of stock value. Shorts of $10 billion is more than 10 days of the normal trading volume. At such volumes, one great bull trigger and the shorters will be FUCKED!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow in Q2 he stepped on the gas, reduced CAPEX and production and sales are higher than ever. As analysts have seen the sales numbers  TSLA has moved up 40% to $250. The shorters are getting squeezed, they can't get out and are hoping for a loss in Q2. Something that will not happen. The Q2-profits will hit and the shorters will be hit so hard the blood will flood wall street trading floors.", "created_utc": 1563292067, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cdysit/elons_short_squeese_trap_is_about_to_close/", "is_self": true}
