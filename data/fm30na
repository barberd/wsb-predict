If you've been reading the news at all, you know that people are getting laid off at monumental rates as the pandemic worsens. Maybe some of you autists know firsthand after being caught trading at work all day while doing nothing else.\n\nAs everything has grinded to a halt, the hospitality industry might be hit the hardest with 15 million jobs that could be lost [\\[1\\]](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2020-coronavirus-hospitality-jobs-at-risk-by-city/); with the casinos closing for the rest of the month, thousands are already at high risk.\n\nNow down to brass tax:\n\n>\\[This line graph represents\\] search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region and time. A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term. A value of 50 means that the term is half as popular. A score of 0 means there was not enough data for this term.\n\nIf you're still too retarded to understand Google Trends, basically this image shows that the amount of people in the united states searching to file unemployment online **SKYROCKETED** march 15 till now (relative to the past 30 days, 90 days, etc)\n\n[https:\\/\\/trends.google.com\\/trends\\/explore?date=today&#37;201-m&geo=US&q=unemployment&#37;20how&#37;20to](https://preview.redd.it/8fxlsrc84wn41.png?width=2322&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb6afdb0eb1e4667ab20f4b9916c6a4fd763eb68)\n\nSo remember that DOL report I told you about earlier? Yeah well like I said they do it weekly. [They released one this past thursday](https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf), HOWEVER, they only reported the data up to MARCH 14! What does that mean? The throngs of people that started getting laid off this week have not been reported officially to the public yet, and when they do next thursday, I speculate the market will bleed in reaction to all of their consumers being without work and without money. **There's one caveat to this speculation:** I'm not sure how fast people can file for unemployment. So if someone was laid off this thursday and they don't report it till next Tuesday, my speculation could be a week early.\n\nPersonally, I'm going to be looking for non-essential retail companies over the weekend to collect a series of tickers to buy end of april / may puts for. People are not going to be going to red lobster (NYSE: DRI), they will not be shopping at malls [(NYSE:SPG)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fh9ipg/rare_find_im_buying_puts_on_the_largest_shopping/)\\*, they won't be buying the newest jordans (NIKE), and i really hope they don't spend their 1k trump bucks on a $999 macbook air (AAPL), but people are retarded so they might.\n\n\\* Note about SPG: I called this stock a week or so ago and made big bucks off it (for me anyway). I'm not sure how much more it can go down though considering it has a lot of equity tied up into valuable real estate. Maybe someone less autistic can do a proper DD of it's future.Paid $855.00 for this win (retarded, should have held):\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.reddit.com\\/r\\/wallstreetbets\\/comments\\/fh9ipg\\/rare\\_find\\_im\\_buying\\_puts\\_on\\_the\\_largest\\_shopping\\/](https://preview.redd.it/6ntynxlq8wn41.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7a444463805a6f01830fc75ef98b25ed7c4197a)\n\n**TLDR:**  BIG unemployment numbers coming next thursday and the thursday after that. stonks go down\n\n4/17 SPY P $69\n\nEDIT: I want to note higher unemployment will also eventually lead to the pop in the auto loan bubble (IMO)\n\nDon't forget I'm a retard and this isn't advice\n\nEDIT 2: Just found a similar thread posted recently with supportive data:**Unemployment from 2,000 to 80,000 a day in California!!!**\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fm17ed/unemployment\\_from\\_2000\\_to\\_80000\\_a\\_day\\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fm17ed/unemployment_from_2000_to_80000_a_day_in/)", "created_utc": 1584739279.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fm30na/dd_the_market_might_crash_hard_next_thursday_and/", "is_self": true}
