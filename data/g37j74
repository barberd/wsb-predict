Automotive decreased 1% to account for 4%. **Digital consumer electronics increased 44%** to account for 5%.\" -- CFO of TSM at their quarterly earnings call, yesterday.\n\nAlso, the all-knowing Bloomberg is reporting, [\"Apple Chipmaker TSMC\u2019s Profit Soars on iPhone Demand\"](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-16/apple-chipmaker-tsmc-s-profit-soars-on-internet-iphone-demand) but wait, there's more. Goldman, per Bloomberg, [is pricing Apple at $233 now.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-17/apple-may-lose-a-third-of-quarterly-iphone-sales-goldman-says)\n\nSo who do we believe? Well, that's up to you, but I'm going with the quarterly earnings report.\n\nMore DD for the ambitious ones:\n\n\"Moving into **second quarter 2020**, we expect our **revenue to be flattish**, as **weaker mobile product demand** is expected to be **balanced by continued 5G deployment** and HPC-related product launches. \n\nFor the **whole year of 2020**, we now forecast the **overall semiconductor market, excluding memory growth, to be flattish to slightly decline**, while foundry industry growth is expect to be high single-digit to low-teens percentage.\n\nWe maintain our **forecast for mid-teens penetration rate for 5G smartphone** of the total smartphone market in 2020.\n\nWe continue to expect faster penetration of 5G smartphones, as compared to 4G, over the next several years, with substantially higher silicon content. Thus, **we believe 5G as a multiyear megatrend is still strong and will fuel the growth of all four of our growth platforms in the next several years.** HPC will be another major long-term growth driver for TSMC.\"\n\n[Transcript from TSM with my highlights](https://discordapp.com/channels/671848366849785856/671848366849785860/700679432721006592)\n\n[5G Patents by company, granted and pending as of 02/25/2020](https://www.statista.com/chart/20095/companies-with-most-5g-patent-families-and-patent-families-applications/)\n\nSo as you can see, 5G is going to be the savior for this company this year and NOK has the second most patents in 5G technology.\n\nTLDR:\n\nAAPL $260p 5/1\n\nNOK $4c 1/21/22", "created_utc": 1587147885.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g37j74/tsm_apples_chipmaker_says_smartphone_revenue_down/", "is_self": true}
