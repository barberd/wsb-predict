Let's say this is just the beginning of a long path to TENDIES for everyone and SPCE share price growth continues until it's in the $1,000's to $2,000's. If I was to buy a 1/2021 $17.5 Call for $1,360 and hold it till the end of 2020, what would I have to worry about concerning the growth on my initial investment ($1,360). I would think the value of the call would increase over time as the stock price goes up, but I want to know if there are any negative effects on the call's price growth that could occur and I'm not aware of? It can't go tits up right?", "created_utc": 1581882061, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f4vvkl/spce_2021_call_2_tendies_into_20_tendies_over_a/", "is_self": true}
