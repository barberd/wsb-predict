{"id": "f7jzrn", "title": "Go LONG on NVDA (we're looking at 6-12 months here folks DD below)", "selftext": "* Okay. Let's get some shit out in the clear first. The way forward for gaming is **game streaming** by game streaming I mean cloud gaming services like Googles Stadia.\n* First of all **Why?**\n* Hardware is expensive in gaming. Like very expensive consider your gaming pc a goos high end gaming pc can easily be worth in excess of several *thousand* dollars which is often an upfront cost most casual gamers *cannot afford to cough up* andd most importantly if the latest games keep getting more intensive on ram and cpu you will need to upgrade it eventually anyway. This means that any cloud gaming service like Nvidia's GEFORCE NOW which is free for an hour of gaming before you need to relog or for roughly 5 pounds a month you can play with decent fps on almost any steam game (something which stadia doesn't allow you to do and is more expensive with an even smaller game pool to play on). Even if you have a MAC you can play steam games which is huge for the gaming market in general.\n* **What does this mean for my AMD tendies?**\nBasically AMD doesn't have a streaming service able to compete with Geforce Now. Geforce now has been in apply only beta for **3 fucking years already** and has accumulated 1 million users  before it went free for everyone to access use provided they queue for available slots on the service (if they have a free account that is (you starting to see the hook and draw tactic Nvidia is playing here?)). Amd is literally stuck in the past making hardware plays whilst Nvidia storms ahead in the game streaming market. Who cares is AMD is hooking up with Apple for a swanky new Mac if people wouldn't need to upgrade to said swanky new Mac cuz their getting their gaming and other capabilities on their old Mac's using Geforce Now. \n\n* **Okay I hear you, most people don't buy Mac's for gaming anyway**\nBut... amd is fundamentally a graphics card company and if you look at it in the perspective of a games streaming service such as Nvidias which already had a massive user base BEFORE it went public and easy to access. The growth potential on Nvidia rn is crazy. \n**So now that Geforce NOW has gone free and easily accessible how are the average consumers reacting?**\nOkay firstly there isn't a lot of statistics for this out yet considering Nvidia has only just fully released it from beta two weeks ago. However, whilst playing recently it has been impossible to miss a **sharp rise in people talking about and using geforce now in game** the ability to play any game regardless of your pc and only requiring a good internet speed (see starlink for any doubters that this will hold geforce now back) is too amazing to pass up on. The average user if they get the 5pound subscription will only spend like 60 bucks a year on Geforce Now compared to the 1000 they would have to spend to upgrade their pc. Also the versatility of geforce now is frankly scary. Consider playing games on ur phone,  TV, or anything for that matter. All u need is a good internet speed.\n**In summary** for this section is suspect geforce now is going through a period of **rocket** growth **you heard it here first** keep an eye on Q2 and Q3 NVDA to see whether or not they start talking about the potential there. Amd is legit getting slept on here I'm telling u\n\n* **TLDR** NVDA is developing a Netflix of game streaming that AMD is sleeping on and is UNDERCUTTING and OUTPERFORMING and quite honestly probably out selling google stadia. With 1 million beta users before going publicly available the growth potential is huge. **BUY NVDA longs at NVDA bottom and hold for YEAR END.**", "created_utc": 1582328614, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7jzrn/go_long_on_nvda_were_looking_at_612_months_here/", "is_self": true}
