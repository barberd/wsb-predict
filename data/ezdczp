He\u2019s already been on leave for months. Seems like an overreaction to me.\n\nHere\u2019s why I bought Calls:\n\n\u2022 Gta and read dead online hit record numbers of players in December. \n\n\u2022 both GTA and read dead online have constantly been releasing new expansions are not cheap and I bought them and I know hella people did\n\n\u2022 The stock has been getting hit this past week so it\u2019s at the lows for the past two weeks\n\n\u2022 TTWO has a high rate of beating earnings and delivering surprises\n\nHere\u2019s a few additional bullish thoughts:\n\nGTA online is rewarding everybody who logs in between now and Feb 13th $1,000,000 gta cash to celebrate record numbers. Seems pretty damn bullish to me. \n\nThe Casino addition to GTA is one of the biggest money makers they added. Blackjack, poker, roulette, horse betting. I think this virtual casino can create gambling addicts who will be sucking dick for that gta virtual currency for quarters to come. \n\nTLDR: Buy TTWO, stock down, earnings tomorrow, usually beat earnings", "created_utc": 1580925077, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ezdczp/now_is_a_good_time_to_invest_in_ttwo/", "is_self": true}
