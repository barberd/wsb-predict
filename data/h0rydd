Even a plane needs to land to refuel, birds need to rest it's wings and Spaceships need to bring astronuts back to earth. Even JPow, knows that nothing goes up forever. He said so today.\n\n!RemindYourselves, SPY will correct back to $2762 to the penny by July.\n\nI am a gay bear from the future and I have come to give you tendies. I don't care of you go long or short, but $2762 is your key physiological level to keep an eye on. Don't listen to those dumb ass hedge fund managers calling for $3000 support. All those dumb ass do is buy overvalued stocks and pump them on CNBC (looking at TSLA). $2762 is your friend. I am your friend. Bears should collect profit at this level while bulls should go long here.\n\nElectricity is a rarity in the future, so I will log out for the time being. I will be back to give you the next play post July.", "created_utc": 1591849395.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h0rydd/bloody_red_monday_incoming/", "is_self": true}
