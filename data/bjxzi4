Profit and revenue are still strong.\n\nhttps://www.gurufocus.com/stock/TAP/summary\n\nHas craft beer been eating some of the market?  Yes.  But here comes global warming.  \n\nHops are grown in the northwest US.  Many get their water from snow runoff, not irrigation.  So warmer weather in winter reduces the amount of snow leaving less runoff come summer time.  \n\nLast time hops had a drought due to less snow runoff was 2015 and Sam Adams would go around giving away their stock pile to small brewers (or selling them at cost I can't remember) so they could survive  \n\nhttps://wxguys.ssec.wisc.edu/2018/02/12/hops/\n\nWashington data 2015 \nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/national/201512\n\nWashington data 2018: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/national/201812\n\nThis winter was warmer with even less precipitation.  \n\nPhotosynthesis for almost all hop breeds shuts down approaching 90 degrees.  So there you have a 2-pronged attack.  Warm winters and warmer summers are bad for hops.  \n\nHops prices are already up 250% over the past decade due to higher demand and lower yield.\n\nhttps://www.climate.gov/news-features/climate-and/climate-beer\n\nBarley gets crushed by droughts too.  \n\nhttps://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2018/10/18/658174335/brewers-barley-growers-say-don-t-drown-your-sorrows-over-global-warming-just-yet\n\n&gt;In their paper, a team of 10 scientists from China, Britain, the United States and Mexico warn that crop damage from worsening droughts and heat waves could cause global beer production to tumble by 16 percent. This will cause global beer prices to increase, possibly doubling on average. The research also warns that a serious hit to barley yields will disproportionately impact brewers. That's because livestock farmers who feed barley to their animals will be forced into competition with beer producers for limited supplies of the grain. And, under such economic conditions, beer will lose.\n\n&gt;The study corroborates prior findings about grains and climate change. A 2017 study from the University of California, Davis predicted that higher temperatures in spring and summer could reduce the yields of many grains important to beer by the end of the century. It predicted winter wheat yields would drop by 21 percent, winter barley by 17.3 percent and spring barley by 33.6 percent.\n\nThere's been a shift in barley production coming from Canada due to the cooler climate.  \n\nSo you're saying, wait this is bad for all beer.  True.  But there is a strong correlation to warmer temperatures and beer sales.  People will never stop drinking beer.  So the question is, who will survive the lower hop and barley supply?  \n\nDomestics already use the cheaper hops anyway.  But more importantly, they have the money to buy the ingredients through supply shifts.  Private and local craft brewers are going to be squeezed out.  In an already over-saturated market, Sam Adams can't bail everyone out this time.  Big beer will rise again! \n\nTAP has direct access to the Canadian barley (and maybe they'll even grow more hops) through their Molson branch\n\nMaybe you can make more money with options by watching the weather and trying to time the effects.  I'm buying shares here and holding long.  The big beer companies will be the only ones left standing after nature has run its course with the full market open to them once again.  And many now have craft beer in their portfolios.  I'm choosing TAP because it's the best value in comparison to BUD and SAM and I drink Miller Lite like a degenerate.", "created_utc": 1556819821, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bjxzi4/tap_molsoncoors_and_global_warming/", "is_self": true}
