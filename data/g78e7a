{"id": "g78e7a", "title": "Starbucks (SBUX) - Guaranteed Earnings Play | Lock of The Century", "selftext": "I will try to keep this as simple and short as possible. Starbucks is set to announce earnings next week April 28th. The stock currently trades for $75 a share. This is about 24% off its all-time high price of $99.72 and about 33% higher than its 52 week low (Which occurred around March 18th). \n\nOur focus in this DD will be on its last Quarterly Report which was announced Jan 28th, 2020. In Q1 2020 Starbucks killed it with \n\n\\- 9% global revenue growth\n\n\\- 539 New Stores (6% increase over prior year)\n\n\\- American store sales up 6%\n\n\\- 3% increase in average ticket\n\n\\- returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends \n\nDuring the Q&A Multiple questions regarding the China situation came up. John Culver explained that at the time \u201cwe currently have over half our stores closed in the market (China)\u201dwith the coronavirus, we are **not revising guidance at this time and as we get more clarity on the situation**, we will transparently communicate with investors. \u201c\n\nIn the call, coronavirus is mentioned 9 times. \n\nSo how can we estimate what percentage of Starbucks stores are closed in the US? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell if we pick a random non-COVID epicenter city, something like Pittsburg PA we can get a glimpse. In the Pittsburg core area, we see 11 stores. **Of those 11 only 2 are working**. An of those 2 it seems only 1 is working full-time hours. So i**n Pittsburg\u2019s city core 9% of Starbucks stores are open** (counting those with limited hours). It's reasonable to assume that conservatively 50% of Starbucks stores are closed around the United States and the ones that are open are probably working limited hours, or drive through service only.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[11 of the stores ](https://preview.redd.it/x364krqqpru41.png?width=332&format=png&auto=webp&s=f14dd47d4e4e76b493c34b48c73bd83c830575ed)\n\nStarbucks is looking at a catastrophe. While its stock has been beatdown to $75 a share, I just don\u2019t see a way they can provide the public with good figures in the near term. Half of its stores must be closed. IT's China business has been in jeopardy since Dec of 2019. Google Trends indicates slowing demand. And with no vaccine insight how much longer can they bleed. On top of all this even when everything opens up, how many customers will return to sit inside and work. How many commuters will simply go remote and never have the opportunity to grab that cup of coffee on their way to work? \n\nBuy PUTS!", "created_utc": 1587734996.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g78e7a/starbucks_sbux_guaranteed_earnings_play_lock_of/", "is_self": true}
