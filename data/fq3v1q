So if you are considering buying make sure it is not high so it doesn't lose its value by the time the bounce hits. \n\n\\- The farther the option is, far OTM, the less likely you will profit or even sell the option. Far OTM is literally a lottery ticket. \n\nDoes this mean that if the market moon at eod, the next day will be red? No, retard. It means that there's a more likelihood that it will be red; it is a possibility, not a certainty. Meaning that the vulnerability that it will fall from its high point will be more sensible than not. This is a gamble. This is a bet. This is wall street fucking bets. \n\n4/17 SPY 240p", "created_utc": 1585337562.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fq3v1q/let_me_tell_you_what_the_mcfuck_is_going_to/", "is_self": true}
