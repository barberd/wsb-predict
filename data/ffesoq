The markets are closed, and your positions are in. Whatever happens when the market opens is a result of you being autistic on Friday...\n\n...but come Monday, you maggots better be reporting back to WSB bright and early. I want to see some juicy shitposts, and gains/loss reports.\n\nBut for real guys, take care of your mental state and don't forget your relationships. INB4 gay, short me, i have corona, why are you on WSB on the weekend too, etc etc\n\nEdit: my position bought at close Friday: AMZN 4/17 1800P\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/PbDMKiU.jpg", "created_utc": 1583684593.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffesoq/just_go_enjoy_your_day_off_my_dudes/", "is_self": true}
