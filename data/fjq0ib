(First one is always free). Then proceeded to blow up my account thinking the stock market was gonna crash. (Funny how that works, I lose it all thinking a recession is coming then get it all back and then more with the actual crash). More time goes by and I basically keep losing small amounts of money here and there. Eventually I got down to exactly $4. Saw a post of a guy turning $250 into 60k and was like fuck that guy and immediately deposited $200. All my plays were very cautious (Not really I\u2019ve just got paper hands). I took profits most of the time and exited if I went down too much. If I had just held all my initial positions through to the end I would probably be up to 50k by now as well but who cares. I\u2019m a 21 year old college student I\u2019ve got plenty of time to turn this into 50k or 0k let\u2019s go. Peace out.\n\ntldr: $1300 -> $4 -> $200 deposit -> $4.2k\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/i1vUstk\n\nAll time: https://imgur.com/gallery/o0O3Saj\n\nPositions: https://imgur.com/a/cf5R8iv super (cluttered with canceled or expired orders sorry not sorry)\n\nEdit: cropped my positions cuz some of y\u2019all don\u2019t know how to behave", "created_utc": 1584384242.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjq0ib/200_42k/", "is_self": true}
