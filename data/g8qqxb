{"id": "g8qqxb", "title": "For those of you who think Boeing's stock will react positively to the weekend news, consider this:", "selftext": "Boeing\u2019s balance sheet is in tatters and its cash flow, already under strain, now rests with its Defense unit and a shrinking stream from the 787, 767 and 777 programs. Cash flow from Boeing Global Services is tanking along with the airline industry.\n\nNew product development was put on the back burner with the firing of CEO Dennis Muilenburg and replacement by David Calhoun.\n\nBoeing 777-9 demand was shrinking before the COVID-19 crisis. It\u2019s worse now. Product development now has ground to a halt. There are no New Market Airplanes, no \u201cNMA Lite,\u201d no Future Small Airplanes in the foreseeable future. There are no customers. It will take years to recover from the virus crisis.\n\nThis means Boeing\u2019s future for this decade, for better or worse, relies on getting the MAX recertified and deliveries restarted.\n\nThe need for access to Embraer engineers and Brazil\u2019s lower cost base, for a new airplane, is over\u2014for now.\nPaying around $5bn for a company that has a market value closer to $1bn is problematic, which the market already knew. Assuming Boeing takes federal money, however the deal may be structured, and that would present huge political problems if Boeing sends $5bn to Brazil.\n\nBoeing\u2019s near-term priority is saving itself and rebuilding its balance sheet. It\u2019s hard to see how Embraer fits into this.\n\nThe 2020 decade is going to be Boeing\u2019s lost decade.\n\nThe market knew this merger was not going to materialize, because simply put Boeing could not afford the merger. So the analysts are already saying BA built a narrative with other excuses, and now ERJ will take legal action, and at the very least it will cost BA a hefty termination fee. The bigger issue is that longer term this puts Airbus in a much better competitive position, as the failed merger gives Airbus an advantage.\n\nTL;DR:\nThere's no joy or excitement for Boeing's stock, relative to the failed merger. Any stock advance Monday or Tuesday will probably be faded, and is another selling opportunity before the crushing blow in their earnings report on Wednesday.
