Ah Fb is now at 212. \n\nAt this point I don\u2019t have an account any more and it\u2019s not really funny because I\u2019m kicking my self over the losses. \n\nIMO I would expect Facebook to recover and hopefully I can recoup some losses but it\u2019s after hours trading that really trashed this stock that\u2019s making me enter the weekend upset? \n\nSo who\u2019s trading calls with me and what are your thoughts/feelings. I\u2019m all in on these Facebook calls", "created_utc": 1593222719.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hgktkz/whos_trading_facebook/", "is_self": true}
