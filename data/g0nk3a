They didnt overstate the opex so it's most likely their profit and profit margins are fucked\n\nMuddywaters has been reporting their fraudulent activities since few years back\n\nhttps://www.muddywatersresearch.com/research/tal/tal-education-part-4/\n\nSo I highly doubt it was just one employee maybe it's the hole company \n\nHere are few highlights \n\n- Since they reported fraud activity they probably have to restate their past earnings\n- Earning is in 10 days\n- its chinese company so JPow wont pump this stock\n- stock quickly recovered from the fraud report few days ago and it's only 5% down from ATH\n-PE is close to 300 once they adjust their earnings it will be even worse\n- TA is showing head and shoulder formation with neckline around 47\n-Trump is not happy with China and he is blaming China for beer virus but China is keep saying it's from US. So I assume boomers hate Chinese stocks atm\n- they are in education buisness but with corona virus I'm not too sure about their earnings this quarter \n\nAny thoughts?", "created_utc": 1586799207.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0nk3a/tal_puts/", "is_self": true}
