Gay Bears aren\u2019t invited.", "selftext": "Ran some Capital asset pricing models, statistical models, regression lines, and 20-day moving averages on the DOW Jones and S&amp;P from 6/27/2018 to today with a standard error of .01(which means it is accurate based on the amount of data points). I think we are close to the bottom however, I expect we may continue with slight or equivalent decreases (3% or less) in the coming days and a couple of jumps until we are out of the slump in a 2 to 3 week time period. Of course, this is only a statistical prediction but if things go according to historical data, we should be in the clear. Note: Q1 earnings may affect/contradict these projections and cause a downtrend.", "created_utc": 1582697717, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9owft/bullish_statistical_thought_not_fact_autists_gay/", "is_self": true}
