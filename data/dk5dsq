They'll just imagine it turning into a [rags to riches story, book deal and movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMrZJEuyOCw). A good trader has zero self-awareness. They'll show off their money and winnings in a ghetto, assuming everyone roots for them. A good trader doesn't think that hooker loves him; [he knows it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emEM5H9NgTI). A good trader always remembers [what Kipling said](https://imgur.com/a/B9T7V8K). At the end of the day, we'll all die, with our life story written in a book. Some books will be interesting.
