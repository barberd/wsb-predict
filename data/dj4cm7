We were in at all time highs, and days away from entering the largest selloff since the financial crisis. \n\nWhy? \n\n* Fed was hiking despite growth concerns, and using a language such as \"auto pilot\" \n* Fed was removing liquidity from the market via quantitative tightening\n* Trade war with China was on an escalating trajectory\n* Bloomberg gave it all a bit of a push, by causing a big tech selloff with the \"big hack\" fake story \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow let's imagine a parallel universe, where things played out a bit differently. Once again imagine you're back to October 2018.\n\n**Let's say:** \n\n* Fed came to its senses, and promised not to hike in December 2018, in fact it says that it's time to cut and they will cut three times\n* Fed announces the end to quantitative tightening, and instead injects liquidity into the market via something looking a bit like QE\n* China and US agree on a \"phase 1\" deal, they both show willingness to compromise - for example, Trump goes for the \"phase 1\" deal despite saying earlier that it's all or nothing. The escalating trajectory is no more.\n* Bloomberg story turns out to be fake\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Would we sell off to 2300's? Or would we rip through 3000 and likely sit around 3300+ today?**\n\n**Where do you think SPX would be today if you were in the parallel universe where I didn't lose $170k on Jan-19 $1800&amp;$2000 AMZN calls held since July-18?**", "created_utc": 1571307471, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dj4cm7/why_we_didnt_rally_a_year_ago_thought_exercise/", "is_self": true}
