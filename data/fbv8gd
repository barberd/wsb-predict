Concerts in this beerflu? i dont think so. They are only pricing in loss of business in ASIA and went up big on Friday. Teach me how to short this because my broker has no option chain for $LYV\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Wall of text incoming for those not clicking the link.**\n\n \n\nWhile expecting some coronavirus \u201chot spots\u201d and concert cancellations, Live Nation is \u201ccautious\u201d yet \u201coptimistic\u201d the pandemic will not leave a lasting mark on the global concert promoter and ticketer, CEO\u00a0**Michael Rapino** said during Thursday\u2019s earnings call for its [record $11.5 billion 2019 results](https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/touring/9324821/live-nation-revenue-grew-to-11-5b-in-2019-but-its-stock-is-still-falling).\n\nTo be sure, the concert business will be affected by the fast-spreading COVID-19 to some degree. The question is how many concerts will be affected and whether people feel comfortable, or are allowed, to gather in close quarters. \u201cSo \\[over\\] the next few months we\u2019ll have some cancellations, I assume, here and there, \\[at\\] some arenas and clubs,\u201d Rapino said.\n\nBut like a sound investment portfolio, Live Nation\u2019s business is large enough to absorb small shocks, Rapino said. \u201cThe beautiful part of our business model is it\u2019s dispersed over 30,000 shows covering all types of venues and genres.\u201d\n\n \n\nLive Nation has little exposure in COVID-19\u2019s most affected region, he noted. \u201cAsia is less than .01% of nothing of our business right now,\u201d Rapino estimated. Through Thursday, Live Nation had canceled just 17 shows in China with an expected 75,000 fans. In the next three months, Berchtold said Live Nation has 70 shows throughout Asia.\n\nRapino was equally nonplussed about exposure to COVID-19 in Italy, a budding hotspot with 820 cases and 21 deaths confirmed as of Friday (Feb. 28), where Live Nation has 30 shows booked in the next three months with about 125,000 attendance. But overall, Live Nation had seen \u201cno pullback in fan demand or ticket buying outside of the specifically affected areas,\u201d said Rapino.\n\nRapino and president **Joe Berchtold** apparently said the right things Thursday, because Live Nation\u2019s stock saw a significant bounce the next day. On Friday, Live Nation\u2019s share price gained 5.2%, improving the full-week loss to 18.1% and retaking some of the $3.45 billion of market capitalization lost through Thursday.\n\nThe drop share price created a buying opportunity because stock values \u201chave corrected,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst **Benjamin Swinburne** wrote Friday in an investor note that affirmed his $80 price target -- 31.6% greater than Friday\u2019s closing price of $60.77. Swinburne echoed Rapino and Berchtold\u2019s talking points: 2019 revenue and adjusted operating income were strong, the 2020 concert outlook is positive and COVID-19 poses little danger for a company that spans concerts, ticketing, sponsorships and artist management.\n\n \n\nSimilarly, Jefferies analyst **Khoa Ngo** downplayed the threat in a letter to investors. He said COVID-19 risk was mitigated by \u201ca vast geographical footprint,\u201d the company\u2019s flexibility to rebook events and the fact that 70%of the events for the company are scheduled to start after mid-June, which he said \u201cshould mitigate concerns, despite near-term fluidity.\u201d\n\nIt was a brutal week for many travel businesses dependent on international travelers. Following the two-week quarantine of a Carnival cruise ship in Japan, the share prices of three publicly traded cruise companies -- Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian -- fell an average of 21.5% this week. Airlines and hotel companies\u2019 share prices were battered as well. Overall, U.S. stock markets had their worst week since the onset of the Great Recession of 2008 in percentage terms, as the S&amp;P 500 fell 11.5% and the Nasdaq composite dropped 10.5%.\n\nLive music is widely considered to be recession-proof entertainment. \u201cThe great escape,\u201d *Billboard* called the concert business in December 2009 after a record-setting year for global revenue and attendance. The same year, AEG Live president/CEO called London\u2019s O2 Arena \u201cthe recession beater\u201d after drawing 1.34 million fans to 96 shows amidst a challenging financial environment. Now the question is what entertainment music fans will seek if COVID-19 further impacts North America and Europe. What\u2019s scarier: a global recession or a virus that might cause a pandemic and global recession? But at the end of February 2020, with worry still outpacing the actual virus in Live Nation\u2019s key markets, Rapino isn\u2019t doubting live music\u2019s draw: \u201cSupply and demand will be there.\u201d", "created_utc": 1583075207, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbv8gd/i_need_to_know_how_to_short_livenation/", "is_self": true}
