{"id": "ftch8c", "title": "The trade of a decade -- OIL TIME, FUCKERS", "selftext": "**TL;DR $DCP $5c 10/16 or 7/17**\n\nAlright, after a slight mental breakdown from my diamond hands shattering on my SPY puts and losing $21,000 because I refused to hold (And then it drops to $244 today, please actually off me) I'm going full boomer and buying the dip. But no, no, I'm not investing in some fucking bullshit $HOG or ~~COVID morgues~~ Senior Living REIT\n\n**HISTORY**\n\nPeople always gonna need gas. And with Trump we all know what we're gonna get. This man is chain-sucking authoritarian PP all 'round the world, and what two authoritarian nations are in the oil price war? Russia and Saudi Arabia.\n\nNow I don't know about you guys, but Trump has TREMENDOUS calls with Putin. The greatest calls. And don't you remember the  meeting in Saudi Arabia? He [touched the goddamn globe, people.](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/23/world/23orb/23orb-jumbo.jpg?quality=90&auto=webp)\n\nNow if there's one thing I have to give the man credit for, it's making deals ^disregard ^the ^iran ^deal and making the market bullish as fuck as long as he's not pressed on anything by a reporter (and even this shit would still moon)\n\nNot only is he gonna save oil, you know damn well he'll give bailouts and more subsidies if he has to. The man hasn't just deregulated them, he's fucking empowered them with government positions. And you know damn well know that subsidies won't have any issue passing Congress.\n\nI've spoken enough on the history of this gay price war and I know you were all expecting positions by now, and to you I say go look up top you fucking retard\n\nFuck USO. Fuck this stupid ETF, we're gonna go with a midstream petroleum company. Now I know nothing about the oil industry so you know you can trust my DD. But I read somewhere on this subreddit that midstreams will probably be fine through this whole thing. We're goin' with $DCP.\n\n**DCP Midstream Partners**\n\nNow I'm gonna go into the details but the TL;DR of this section is that DCP is expected to go to $13, it's estimated to be oversold after the oil price war was priced in, and the company is in a very good spot to get through this crisis as they don't have any debt due until September. They've also made strides to save money.\n\nNot only that, but [here's a goddamn all-time chart](https://i.imgur.com/Zwp98IP.png) to show you exactly what happened every time it crashed hard. THIS IS THE FUCKING DIP. This shit always recovered pretty well within three months of the bottom.\n\nFurthermore, the Relative Strength Index (which is some technical shit I'll only listen to if it aligns with the positions in my RH account and preconceived notions about the world and my understanding of the market) is [TWENTY](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dcp-midstream-enters-oversold-territory-150503051.html). If it's below 30 it's in oversold territory. Now that's a pretty big fucking gap and signals to me to buy calls.\n\nNot only that, [the company has taken steps to cut costs and pay debt.](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4334931-dcp-midstream-partners-significantly-undervalued-investors-panic) No debt is due until September 21, and the extra money in their budget can enable them to ride out this wave in relative comfort.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nSo what should you buy? Well, unfortunately politics takes time and the price won't just suddenly shoot up to $20 in a week. Personally, [I bought 23 7/17 5c contracts and 5 10/16 5c contracts](https://i.imgur.com/scijn6Q.png). If you're feeling like that's some pussy shit and you're extra retarded, I invite you to buy contracts expiring 4/17 or 5/15 but I'm 90% sure they won't go anywhere.\n\nStill bearish as fuck about the market right now but I think this has hit its bottom and I'm anticipating it to go up as we move through the recession.\n\nOnce more for those who have bad eyesight:\n\n**$DCP $5c 10/16 or 7/17**\n\nEDIT: I've read your comments, I've seen a lot of sense being made, and it's clear I'm going against the sentiment of WSB. Which means I'm inversing the subreddit properly and therefore my calls will print baby!
