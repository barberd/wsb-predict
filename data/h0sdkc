{"id": "h0sdkc", "title": "Tendies or ban", "selftext": "So I\u2019ll post pictures at some point, but here\u2019s my story.\n\nStarted trading options just under 2 weeks ago\n\nFirst excitement was buying slack/work calls at 30.50 (before pump), paper handsing around 30% gains, then messed up and bought way OTM calls and OTM puts expiring right after earnings.\n\nBlah blah blah, I\u2019ve made some interesting moves with the short time I\u2019ve traded, but I\u2019ve been net negative.\n\nThat is until I bought my spy $320.50 C/P 6/12 straddle today around 1 PM EST today.\n\nI think tomorrow I will finally be blessed with a tendies oven maker 310. Should that be the case, I\u2019m outta here. I have a down payment to save for, and I\u2019m sure my wife would appreciate the risk mitigation.\n\nThe only reason  for which I would choose to stay, is if the SPY gods decide opening at $320.00 - $321 .00 is fated (in which case, fuck me right?).\n\nShould that happen, I will sell all remaining options at ask price first thing after open, and yolo whatever play gets the most upvotes here.\n\nEdit: Oops, I think title should say \u201cLose money or Ban\u201d. Please ban me if spy isn\u2019t at 320-321 at open. Tee hee.\n\nEdit edit: If no play suggestions gets upvoted, then I shall yolo HTZ 1-2 wk OTM calls.
