He picked it up and eagerly opened his texts. \u201cJay, I\u2019m sending a private jet to get you to Mar-a-Lago. It\u2019s a tremendous jet, some say the very best. Don\u2019t forget the crack.\u201d He was so excited. He would see his president soon, his friend, his lover, his champion. Nobody could hurt him when he was with Trump. He had experienced so much hurt in the months since Biden had become president. His two greatest passions, lost to him. Money and Trump, nothing could get him high like a dose of money and Trump. Not even the drugs. Though he had let them both slip through his fingers when the rug-pull finally occurred. All his efforts in vain, he had carried the market on his back for months.
