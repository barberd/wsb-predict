{"id": "eg61tr", "title": "Supreme autist here needing tax help", "selftext": "So, ive never actually filed taxes on capital gains because until this year I never really had any...\n\n\n Had a gain of 900$ in 2016, loss of 8k in 2017.  And Loss of 19k in 2018.  This is all short term losses from stupidity and under \"wash sales losses dissallowed\" it says (200,000) in 2018 and similarly high numbers for the others.  aka I day traded alooot.  I was up nearly 100% in AMD until it crashed after that massive runup and I ended the year with a loss of said 19k.  Well this year I happen to have gains of like 6k.  So my question is, does the wash sales thing mean I cant claim those previous years losses?  Or the fact that I havent claimed any of this because its all losses, am I still able to claim the losses?  I have filed taxes every year, but since I just lose money and never expected to make any due to the fact im a degenerate gambler, I never worried about it as the IRS isnt gonna come knocking to make sure I get a tax writeoff.\n\nSo can I or should I actually file all these previous gains and losses and if I have thousands in wash sales does that void my losses?  I figured if I ever made money that 19k would take the hit but I didnt know about wash sales.  The very last trade I made in 2018 was TDAmeritrade margin calling my account and selling my position at that 19k loss, aka I had at the beginning of the year and ended the year with 6k.  so Idk if this is considered a wash trade still since I didnt trade after that either.  How much trouble would I be in if I got audited?   \n\nIm not expecting serious replies just mostly sarcastic condescending remarks telling me how stupid I am but also being vaguely helpful.", "created_utc": 1577419512, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eg61tr/supreme_autist_here_needing_tax_help/", "is_self": true}
