I find it easier to use than a watchlist with a random order of stocks. Got removed from r/stocks cuz I called people that would ruin the spreadsheet autist lol. \n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NXViK3RB0Dgs7rKJiqaZe1hD13jbdtamZyhG2G8r1\\_8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NXViK3RB0Dgs7rKJiqaZe1hD13jbdtamZyhG2G8r1_8/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI recommend zooming out to 65 percent, BTW not all these stocks are in my portfolio. Some are but most are just ones I like to keep track of. Whats stocks do you think I should add?\n\nEDIT: To edit your own, go to files and click make a copy, then paste on your google sheet. All of the functions I used are from google finance attributes which you can google and find how to do. If you have any specific questions on formulas DM me.", "created_utc": 1568172902, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d2jz69/google_spreadsheet_with_my_favourite_stocks/", "is_self": true}
