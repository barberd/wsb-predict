{"id": "duxrof", "title": "Is $ROPE a good company?", "selftext": "I see a lot of people around here mention $ROPE as a backup company after experiencing huge losses, but I don't seem to find any information on it anywhere. From my understanding it's a guaranteed +5000% return so it's kind of OK but I need something like that now because I just lost all my student loans, my inflatable doll boob job fund, and my third testicle transplant fund on some stupid AAPL options. I've been really depressed, sometimes I even consider suicide... Anyway, can you please tell me more about this company?", "created_utc": 1573501668, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/duxrof/is_rope_a_good_company/", "is_self": true}
