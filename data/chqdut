ASP is lower this quarter, but GPU sales have started to gain momentum. \nThere will still be a decrease, but it might not be as bad as analysts predict it would be. That's why I think the stock will raise modestly, both on this and revised Q3 estimates. \nDisclaimer: This is all based on some very shaky stuff so don't take it as advice for investing purposes.", "created_utc": 1564073926, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/chqdut/using_pcpartpicker_and_cpu_benchmark_to_predict/", "is_self": true}
