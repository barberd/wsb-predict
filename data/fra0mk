{"id": "fra0mk", "title": "TA: Where SPY Goes From Here", "selftext": "Hello fellow downs, retards, and fetal alcohol syndromites,\n\nAfter some self-reflection and adderall, I've decided that instead of using my powers solely for evil via the comment section as I have heretofore from time to time like the 99%, to actually use them for good sometimes and start making what could be valuable contributions.  In this instance, that means spending a few minutes rubbing your back and telling you your puts will be okay, allowing your mother time to get herself and your sister warmed up for me.  Three birds.\n\nI started with some material /u/Variation-Separate posted, sending me down a Google rabbit hole of TA for the last two days. Naturally, when it comes to the Wyckoff method, I'm something of a scientist myself now.\n\n[My first pretty picture](https://imgur.com/a/CAy3GEJ)\n\nAfter review SPY appears to most likely be in the later stages of a distribution event, otherwise meaning stocks go down soon. My pretty gay pink line is what I'm anticipating, with the orange less likely. No fibonacci's or elliot wave involved here, maybe I'll google those and provide an update on the Illuminati for you, I've heard they're chill.\n\n  Institutions have pretty thoroughly milked the market for every markup they can, and supply should be met with lower prices going forward.  Not to mention, the market can only stick its head so far up its ass for so long, so with the US's beer flu count jumping 50% in two days AFTER taking the #1 spot, further unemployment increases (fueled by the desire to have less mandatory payroll with the fun new stimulus money), and all the earnings/reports to come out this week with anal seepage, the bounce should not continue. Not to forget though that CFO's are dying from corona and finance ministers are jumping in front of trains now too.\n\n**TL;DR** Your puts will print, stop crying its really distracting us upstairs.\n\nPositions\n4/17 SPY 180P 4/20 SPY 210P 5/1 SPY 210P 215P 4/17 SBUX 50P\n\nAll TA folks with constructive critiques are very welcome, holla.", "created_utc": 1585504514.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fra0mk/ta_where_spy_goes_from_here/", "is_self": true}
