F ord has been moving from 6.19 at close to 7 premarket and then 6.70 at open. THOSE ARE SMALL GAINS but yet it\u2019s a daily thing. Constant tendies is better than expired tendies. All you big time mofos in here could make 5-10k a day ngl. Spent 2k on SPY puts but left off some to do this constant TENDIE loophole with margin, since if you make profit they let you borrow more and then redo steps over and over again. I think I might of grew an extra chromosome but as retarded as this sounds, ford owes me my FUCKIN MONEY. \n\nP.S ima kick myself in the nuts if those damn contracts value goes up next week.
