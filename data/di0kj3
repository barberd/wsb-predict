However I am a swing trader and would like to get better at scalps especially on a single ticker like SPY or QQQ etc. \n\nDoes anyone have an options strategy that works over 50% of the time? I would love to start a basic discussion on the following \n\n1) what indicators are you using. If it\u2019s moving averages please be specific with SMA or EMA and how you are using it. \n\n2) what time frame are you using these indicators on \n\n3) what option strike are you trading. Are you trading the closest daily expiration or maybe the weekly or monthly. Are you buying at the money, in the money or out of the money\n\n4) how are you exiting. \n\n\nI will start. \n\nI like the 5 and 20 EMA on a five minute combined with Stocastics on a regular setting \n\nI try to get at the money options with the daily expiration or sometimes an expiration with a week away just in case the direction changes quickly on me I have more time to recover\n\nI enter at the cross of the 5 and 20 and exit at the first resistance line I see. I mark the resistance lines with the 15 minute chart.", "created_utc": 1571102977, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/di0kj3/spy_scalping_strategy_1_or_2_day_trade/", "is_self": true}
