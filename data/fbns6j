Just like LYV, nobody is going out, nobody. And they especially are not going to be taking their kids to virus incubators such as PLAY (Dave &amp; Busters) anytime soon while Beer Virus is scorching Mother Earth. In addition, they have been growing and they have been funding this expansion with debt. If you are not generating to support the P&amp;I, then you certainly won't be able to payout dividends. They have already taken a haircut on valuation, and options premiums are high (e.g. IV +76%), but this is just the beginning and will be get much worse before it gets better. Consumers have far too many choices for at home entertainment. Remember, a company can always go to ZERO.\n\nFYI... I gave you all WELL and that is down nearly 10% from the post.
