{"id": "b67twh", "title": "Personal bankruptcy imminent boys", "selftext": "Just gonna start this off by saying I'm not looking for a pity party or anyone's help. I just figure my deplorable situation could at the very least make an entertaining Reddit post.\n\nAny who here's the situation boys. I lost my job back in March at Amazon. I got randomly screened for drugs and tested positive for marijuana (helps with my insomnia). Since then, I've basically given up on finding a new job. I'm at a point in life where if I just keep grinding away at some meaningless, tedious job, I'll probably end up offing myself. I've messed with stocks/options ever since I was in high school, last year I had my best day ever when I made 2.5k in a single day. That was about 2 months salary at the time, so I was pretty hype. Regardless, my dumb ass has decided to try and start trading full time to make ends meet.\n\nSo big whoop right? Why is that even worth making a post about? Whelp I'm in a lot of debt. Especially for someone my age. I've racked up about 11k in credit card debt in the past 18 months. I've got basically nothing to show for it/to sell as well, since it was mainly money spent on gas/food those sort of things. \n\nI don't have access to margin, so without and money coming in, I have to take cash advances out whenever I don't think I have enough money to keep trading. This shit is basically spiraling out of control, since I don't know how to do anything but buy puts that expire in hours/days. \n\nBarring a good string of trades here soon, I won't be able to make credit card payments, I'll likely get a card or two canceled as my credit score plummets and lenders learn I can't take on further debts. At that point I won't have much savings wise to fall back on to pay rent/buy food etc. \n\nFor whatever it's worth, two years ago I had revolving lines of credit that were paid off in full every month (no credit card debt) and about 5k worth of savings + equities like CGC and Aurora. Life moves quickly boys. Autism makes ya do weird shit. \n\nTL;DR I lost my job and decided to start slangin' FDs like a true retard. The rat race was definitely a better bet. \n\nI have an imgur with a bunch of credit card balances/recent trades as proof of all this extreme autismo but I'm not entirely sure whether it's a good idea to post all of that yet. Still trying to make sure none of them have personal info showing. \n\n ", "created_utc": 1553711420, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b67twh/personal_bankruptcy_imminent_boys/", "is_self": true}
