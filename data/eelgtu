Why would I waste hundreds of thousands of dollars on research reports and paying analysts to research stonks for me? No one here ever makes money so my strategy literally can't go tits up. I mean this is a hypothetical scenario as I'm 32, unemployed and live with my parents. I lost all my money on TSLA puts but once I get all my Xmas gifts I'm going to sell them on eBay and use the cash to startup my own $600 AUM fund which will involve trades that are the opposite to what everyone here discusses.", "created_utc": 1577112385, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eelgtu/if_i_was_a_fund_manager/", "is_self": true}
