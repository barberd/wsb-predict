These four may or may not perform well, but it's the best I could do using what I have and where I'm at.  I prefer to focus on the software segment within tech, but a few venture out from time to time, such as BJRI, a boring, simple restaurant..  \n\nThe story with NUVA is an interesting one, really changing the game when it comes to nerve avoidance in spinal procedures.
