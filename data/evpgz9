A full Shutdown of China for a month will mean about 1.5 trillion of GDP lost for the year, not including other countries and the shut down/quarantine that would have go in place. This is worse than the Spanish flu of 1918 and will kick start the new great depression. A 1 week shutdown means 2% off of GDP, what happens if you shut down for a month, it is literally a 8% contraction of GDP, basically great depression X10. All of this coupled with a collapse in emerging markets, and nobody shopping/buying shit (nobody will deliver your ecommerce crap) or making money. The healthcare system will be overwhelmed, doctors and nurses start dying and all the people will go untreated. I will take my put tendies to buy 500 acres in west virginia and bug out with my guns and gold and goats. RIP Bulls!\n\n[Get REKT](https://imageproxy.themaven.net/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fmaven-user-photos%2Fmishtalk%2Feconomics%2FzmfATcSa4EegwR7v_znq6Q%2FVGObaSoLPk2t6x19vEuC0Q?w=788&amp;q=40&amp;h=558.3367875647668&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5&amp;fp-z=1&amp;fp-debug=false)", "created_utc": 1580316769, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/evpgz9/get_rekt_bulls_coronavirus_on_track_for_1_million/", "is_self": true}
