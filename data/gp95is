{"id": "gp95is", "title": "Vegas reopening on June 4th", "selftext": "I\u2019ve been to Vegas 25 times over about a 15 year period and my thought is that the casinos are in SERIOUS trouble - at least in the short to medium term.  Vegas provides an experience like few other places.  It encourages interaction, meeting new people and quite frankly, a a lot of casual sex - paid or otherwise.\n\nThe Vegas that\u2019s about to go online on June 4th will suggest none of the above. No bars, nightclubs, conventions or live events with fans.  The casino floor will have table games sealed off with plexiglass.  What does a craps table look like with half the people playing, none of whom are slapping high fives, screaming and hollering?  You\u2019re going to have all the employees and half the guests wearing masks.  Who wants to play blackjack in an environment that more closely resembles the local hospital?\n\nIf someone needs their gambling fix they can just stop by the casino in their hometown.  I mean, why would anyone travel to Vegas when the Vegas experience will be all but eliminated?  And if you live in Las Vegas and need your fix, you\u2019re certainly not going to MGM Grand or Caesar\u2019s.  Because you never went to those big strip hotels in the first place.\n\nUntil a 100% effective treatment or vaccine is developed, I predict a somber, unprofitable and quite honestly, boring Las Vegas moving forward - which is incredibly sad. But incredibly jovial for put holders, so take this and load up on long  puts on MGM, CZR, and ESPECIALLY ERI. Vegas will shit itself again after they \u2018re-open\u2019 and I want my fellow autists not to be holding the bag.", "created_utc": 1590255914.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gp95is/vegas_reopening_on_june_4th/", "is_self": true}
