I got the feeling that almost each day I watched it, it had a couple of spots during the day where it seemed almost destined to pop, if even for a little bit. At the same time, it\u2019\u2019s been actually ending days down a lot lately, having calmed since March and April. I decided to take a look to see if my hunch on intraday values being higher than closing prices played out in the data. What I found is going to probably drastically determine how I play VXX during the choppy day ahead.\n\n**Looking for indicators of elevated trade value**\n\nThe last three months since the crash have been all over the place like VXX\u2014like it has been for everything else. Looking at the \u201chistorical data\u201d since then showed that VXX seems to often trade at a value higher than the previous day\u2019s close at some point during the following day. The chart below shows the date, what the close % was (up or down) was that day, and what the stock price high was the next day as a *percentage increase/decrease over the previous day\u2019s close* (calling it NDT for next day top % because I don\u2019t know the real name and gay bears love tops). Red and green, obviously, represent positive and negative increases for each factor.\n\nSo, for example, May 20th would be a) what it closed at by %, and NDT would be what the difference in % was from that close to the next day's high.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mmfd1lg407651.png?width=788&format=png&auto=webp&s=9cb3401746ce730ec2e093238c340dac9e6f9572\n\nVXX stock day change and the amount % change the next day's high reprinted by \"NDT\". The next day's high for VXX was much more often greater than the previous close's.\n\n**I noticed a lot  of green in the columns for NDT, no matter VXX closed that day**. I applied a standard deviation of (+/-1) for day change so that choppy days which were inconsequential didn\u2019t getting counted as too positive or negative (a .5% increase/decrease day for such a volatile stock, to me, doesn\u2019t mean it ended up or down so much as it traded back to flat) . The numbers get even greener once the 1% standard deviation is applied.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ls5aifq507651.png?width=492&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f4f1d9c951f8425beefa603d8c9f230928a79d8\n\nWithout days in the sample that increased or decreased 1% or less, shit gets even greener\n\nI ran another sort (table 3) which focused on the NDT on red days (days where VXX closed EOD down >1%, and it was nearly bulletproof. I noticed three of the days in question were Friday\u2019s, so I also removed those to distill it even more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z3e9s9d707651.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=09d0945c34d04740ab651980524fcf23e709ab23\n\nWent up to 80% green, 90% when you exclude the Fridays (highlighted days)\n\n**EDIT** **9:18 PM 6/20** **:Comparing with pre-crisis 2020, January 2nd through March 12th**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t2yz4vg807651.png?width=1518&format=png&auto=webp&s=dec7d7b4600f3602daca62c15b6c056ae43a727a\n\nGreen indicates dates with positive NDT. Basically the same as the numbers from March-June 18th. Bolsters the argument and ill look into more sharpening that info and 2019 numbers tomorrow, but you can see for yourself the amount of next day increases.\n\n**Data conclusions:**\n\nSo what\u2019s this actually mean for your gambling investing. It means\n\n**if you purchase a VXX call at EOD, there is a straight up 75% chance that at some point you\u2019re going to have an opportunity to sell the position at the very least 1% higher the following day**. The spread on potential increase is 1%-12.77% with an **average of 3.12%**, and the risk exposure floor (aka it doesn\u2019t work out) is -6.23%.\n\n*Sample size: 58 trading days*\n\n**If you purchase a VXX call at EOD that is it at least 1% DOWN from it\u2019s previous close, there is an 80% chance you will have an opportunity to sell it at at >1% price increase the following day**. The increase spread is 1%-11.25%, with an average of +3.14%\n\n*Sample size: 50 trading days*\n\n**If you purchase a VXX call at EOD that is DOWN >1%** ***on any day other than a Friday***\\*\\*, there is a 90% chance you will get an opportunity to sell it the next day at a >1% or greater increase.\\*\\*\n\n*Sample size: 32 trading days*\n\n**This was also happening before COVID in January-March by comparing the numbers**\n\nSo how do you make tendies off this? Follow some simple rules for VXX\n\n1.\t**Don\u2019t buy VXX calls on a down Friday**\u2014 it likely has something to do with the news cycle and beginning of week SPY pumps and PPT meetings, but fighting SPY on a Monday in this market is statistically not a great idea\n2.\t**If you can\u2019t day trade, pick up an overnight VXX buy EOD when it\u2019s had a really bad day**: If VXX is down (and the more down it is the better), buy a some calls at EOD and let the tendies roast overnight. The odds are in the morning you\u2019ll be up and you can get them off for a profit in the open before getting Theta cucked. If you\u2019re feeling confident in the news cycle, Powell is speaking, etc, then I\u2019d suggest holding them through the morning SPY pump to see if you can get some afternoon traction if you\u2019re feeling greedy.\n3.\t**If you can day trade, buy some VXX in the morning if it\u2019s tanking after a bad day,** data says it will go up if you\u2019re patient. Get rid of it once you're up a few percent at a profit before IV crush.\n\n**How that plays into my week ahead**\n\n**I\u2019m currently holding VXX 6/29c** that got some juicy ITM love during The Quadruple Bitching Hour if it doesn\u2019t get entirely fucked in pre-market Monday. If it\u2019s getting an additional pop I\u2019ll hold in the morning and dump by noon, but if **SPY morning pump starts in earnest by 10 am I\u2019m jumping ship with my profits because that means PPT has arrived in earnest heading into Tuesday.**\n\n**I do not believe VXX will be a strong hold into Tuesday**; I don\u2019t think we are in a second \u201cleg down\u201d or approaching March\u2014it\u2019 just not what the reading I\u2019ve been doing supports. We are in a shitty market being propped up falsely; it\u2019s bullshit, but its where we are and it\u2019s not wise to fight it. Expect a SPY surge to come Tuesday with retail FOMO during this weekend drop, the Tuesday double repo loan (check out my other DD if you\u2019re unfamiliar with the repo schedule and how it affects markets), and if Monday gets lucky enough likely another Powell Dennis-esque \u201cMY TOOLS\u201d announcement.\n\n**By Monday EOD unless it\u2019s a blood bath I\u2019ll be moving heavily into SPY and travel**. I\u2019m also doing some research on tech stocks as a bellwether for current market shifts before they happen, and will probably post a DD about that before Monday open if I find anything I consider convincing.\n\n***What I use to research***\n\nGoogle charts for general trend spotting, Yahoo Finance for historical data. I do all my reading in Barron\u2019s and WSJ, but lately moreso Barron\u2019s. They do a good job of predicting shifts and explaining it in historical terms, rather than reactionary news sources like MarketWatch, CNBC, etc\n\n***TLDR:***\n\n*Buy VXX calls on any day but Friday,* if the stock is down, produces tendies on an overwhelming basis. Next week is gonna be SPY\u2019s week to rise though.\n\n**VXX 6/26 calls**, dump Monday, re-buy in perhaps Wednesday\n\n**SPYC's Monday EOD, out the money**\n\nHave a wild Saturday night!\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n9:30 6/20: repost after mod delete for a ticker symbol mistake\n\n**Quality/Statitical Edit (9 pm 6/20): People said there wasn't a large enough sample size so I went through January 2nd- March 12th and did a super quick additional breakdown and found the same thing pretty much. Out of 49 trading days there were only 11 where VXX next day high wasn't higher than the previous close. Tomorrow I may see what it was like in a similarly volatile time during 09 and also throughout 2019 market, and i'll look more into the spreads I just posted, but at first glance they're over a 1% increase. That data from January to March is now fourth**", "created_utc": 1592714500.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hd0u9d/dd_vxx_next_day_performances_in_2020_pre_could/", "is_self": true}
