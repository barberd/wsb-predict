I'm hoping a new thread will get a better discussion/someone more knowledgeable than my dumb butt to answer. \n\nV, MA, PYPL, SQ, and some other tickers I'm unfamiliar with all took a fat L all day today. They dropped with nearly 2x average 100 day volume (minus SQ). I didn't see any news come out, so I'm confused AF. \n\nHelp me, WSB.
