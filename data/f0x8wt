The were each all over the news for a couple months.  Each was going to infect people at an exponential rate and doom us all.  Do you know what Sars  and Ebola are up to today?  Me neither.  Nobody does.   We all forgot about them whenever some more exciting news came along.\n\nAnd we all know that before spring time nobody is going to give on shit about corona virus.\n\nSo here how we profit off of this certain future.\n\nIts easy.  Can't believe you nubs haven't already made this post.  Cruse lines.  Nobody wants to take a cruise when one limey bear drinker could kill everybody on the ship.  So CCL and RCL are both down 16 to 17% since the virus news came out.  And they'll have a shitty Q1.  So the fuck what, these guys always have a shitty Q1.  The cruise lines make all their money in Q3.  Oh no! nobody is buying tickets during the period when they already weren't buying tickets!  And guess what, nobody is traveling at all.  Delta, and UA are also way down.  All these people are delaying their vacations.  Q2 travel will be up as a result.\n\nFigure out the timing and the specify play for yourself.  But come late spring RCL and CLL will be up 20 to 25%.", "created_utc": 1581193915, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f0x8wt/dd_shitty_dd_profit_over_corona_virus_fear/", "is_self": true}
