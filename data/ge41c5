Some say many companies like American airlines are flat or dying, and betting on the \"airline\" industry, including Boeing, is likely a poor decision. Also something about a guy named Buffet, a guy who most of his early dealings were/would be illegal now, along with insider trading, sold his stocks so we should follow him on Boeing because it's part of the \"airline\" industry.\n\nSelling Boeing, I hate to say it, is possibly the stupidest bet you could possibly make and you may be better off, assuming that you actually sold or put in \"long-term\" puts, *deleting and resigning your brokerage account.*\n\n**NEWSFLASH:** Boeing ***is not an \"airline\" company***, it has planes and participates in that market but it itself is not an \"airline\" industry company.\n\nBoeing is a **DEFENCE CONTRACTOR**. It's in the Arms/Military/Defence Vehicle sector, it's not Jetblue, **stop thinking that Boeing is some random company that flies some people on plane to disneyworld and that's it.**\n\nBoeing makes ***military equipment, weapon ships, fighter jets, helicopters, missiles, vehicle gun attachments for cars and other motors, material for military aircraft, subs, and tanks, shot containers to hold bullets etc. etc.***\n\nSomething like Trump (awhile ago) having planes and aircraft carriers along with marine and navy ships, hanging around the korean waters to intimidate North Korea (but not attack) brought in ***bank to Boeing and other contractors.***\n\nNOW? We are in a situation where multiple countries are buying up weapons and material. Some are scared about the future, some are in bad economic and weekended military state due to the economic consequences of the shutdown, and some just want to beef up their wares. Even the US is currently bumping up National guard equipment and preparing in case of a proxy, or direct skirmish with multiple countries, ***now including the Chinese.***\n\nIf your rationale for abandoning or betting against Boeing is because the \"airlines\" are in trouble and people \"aren't flying planes to disneyworld or to other countries on vacation anytime soon\" then your priorities are completely off the radar.\n\n**Boeing is about to make a shit ton of money not long from now** and you are going to be missing out. It's one of the reasons why Boeing didn't take a bailout, and if that backfires the government will still bail them out anyway because they are basically the \"air\" focused variation of Lockheed or Raytheon.\n\n**Betting against a Defence contractor is not a very wise move in summary.**", "created_utc": 1588706014.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ge41c5/sellinglongputting_boeing_is_a_baffling_and/", "is_self": true}
