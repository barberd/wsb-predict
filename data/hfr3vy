{"id": "hfr3vy", "title": "MFA Financial (NYSE: MFA) is leaving forbearance tomorrow, Friday June 26 and reinstating its dividend", "selftext": "On June 1st, MFA signed into its 3rd forbearance agreement with Barclays since March. \n\n[http://www.mfafinancial.com/file/Index?KeyFile=404187239](http://www.mfafinancial.com/file/Index?KeyFile=404187239)\n\nSince then, the company reported earnings on 6/16, announcing a new deal with Apollo to secure funding. \n\nThat capital raise gave MFA the money it needed to escape from forbearance and re-enact its dividend. The 3rd forbearance is set to expire tomorrow, Friday June 26th.\n\n[http://www.mfafinancial.com/file/Index?KeyFile=404341800](http://www.mfafinancial.com/file/Index?KeyFile=404341800)\n\nThe market agrees MFA's financial position has improved with its debt now trading 88 cents on the dollar (MFA FINANCIAL 8.00% SR NTS ticker symbol: MFO). Another mREIT, New York Mortgage Trust (NASDAQ: NYMT), on June 15 announced a reinstatement of their dividend and was rewarded with a 16% gain on the day (and a 30%+ run up in the days prior with the reinstatement of the dividend known to the market).\n\nThroughout its history since 1998, MFA has traded slightly above book value. With a Q1 book value of 4.34 and an expected book value of $5+ for Q2, MFA is now trading at a 43% discount to Q1 book value (remember Q2 is even higher). If MFA leaves forbearance, which CEO Craig Knutson already announced will happen tomorrow, there is no reason MFA approach book value again.\n\nThis is the easiest gains I've ever seen.\n\nTL;DR: MFA will explode tomorrow, Friday June 26.", "created_utc": 1593108932.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hfr3vy/mfa_financial_nyse_mfa_is_leaving_forbearance/", "is_self": true}
