Everyone on board gets a refund plus credit, and the staff gets 2 months paid leave. Obviously they will have to take the ship out of service, bring it somewhere and lysol the fuck out of it (calls on lysol). \n\nDouble digit dip in bookings, insane amount of cancellations for cruises that allow refunds, the dumbasses that bought nonrefundable are just gonna take it in the ass and go get sick, rinse and repeat.\n\nAll of that is gonna cost a shit ton. \n\nThe norweigan ship, after being denied port entry in four different countries, has now found a desperate mark in cambodia that will allow them in, since there are no \"confirmed\" cases onboard. Norweigan has cancelled all sailings for the ship from april to december. \n\nI honestly forget which cruise line has completely stopped allowing chinese and other asian passport holders on board, but that's kind of a big deal too. \n\nThe stocks are hitting the second consecutive day of 3-4% gains. I know, I know, it's not MSFT but what the fuck is going on? Why is anyone bullish on this? Unless coronavirus literally drops off the map, who would dare go sit in a petri dish for vacation? \n\nYes I am bagholding puts.", "created_utc": 1581553670, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f315iv/cruise_stocks_popping_citing_slowing_infection/", "is_self": true}
