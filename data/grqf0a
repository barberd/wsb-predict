After today's close this has a market cap of $550-$600m and a daily average volume of 3.5m shares. Position screenshot included.\n\nFor all previous information check this out: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/go07dw/dvax\\_the\\_most\\_undervalued\\_covid19\\_vaccine\\_player/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/go07dw/dvax_the_most_undervalued_covid19_vaccine_player/)\n\nI'm following up on my DD post from last week. As you've seen the timing was a little unfortunate because they announced a public offering of $70m at $5.00 per share (which is closing today) that same day. Right now the entry at $4.70 is superb and the DD still stands firm. The firm has announced many partnerships and while others have gone up 500% on less news, this one's still flat.\n\nAs you've surely all heard by now, there isn't going to be *one* COVID-19 vaccine. In fact they won't even have manufacturing capacity to meet world demand until 2022. In total there are currently over 73 vaccines in development but in reality only a few of them will actually get to the market.\n\nSo why will Dynavax (DVAX) make it to the list of the handful of winners?\n\nThe reason: CpG-1018\n\nCpG-1018 is Dynavax's FDA approved adjuvant which is used in their Hepatitis-B vaccine. Heplisav-B is currently the worlds best Hepatitis-B vaccine on the market. In comparison to its peers, the actual vaccinating component of the vaccine is exactly the same (GSK and Merck), however, instead of using aluminum, Dynavax developped their own novel adjuvant CpG-1018 - with world-class results. It is now recommended by the CDC as the standard HepB vaccine.\n\n[https://spice.unc.edu/2018/heplisav-b-a-new-hepatitis-b-vaccine-that-can-be-used-for-pre-and-post-exposure-prophylaxis-of-healthcare-personnel-hcp/](https://spice.unc.edu/2018/heplisav-b-a-new-hepatitis-b-vaccine-that-can-be-used-for-pre-and-post-exposure-prophylaxis-of-healthcare-personnel-hcp/)\n\nInstead of 3 shots and 6 months to immunize a person it now takes 2 shots and 1 month, while achieving better results. That's the power of their adjuvant.\n\n>Seroprotective antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) levels were achieved in **90.0%\u2013100.0%** of subjects receiving HepB-CpG (Dynavax Technologies Corporation), compared with 70.5%\u201390.2% of subjects receiving Engerix-B (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals)\n\nSource: [https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/pdfs/mm6715a5-H.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/pdfs/mm6715a5-H.pdf)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4g22dxesyc151.png?width=995&format=png&auto=webp&s=cba546ce980edde002d468999da172393d7be1fb\n\nNow how's this good in a COVID-19 vaccine?\n\n1. CpG-1018 makes your body build more antibodies faster\n2. CpG-1018 is especially well tolerated among older and immunocompromised people in comparison to aluminum-based vaccines\n\nIn that regard CpG-1018 is the perfect fit for any COVID-19 vaccine and that's why world renowned corporations and institutions are in the process of licensing CpG-1018 from Dynavax to be able to use it in their vaccines.\n\nSome of the biggest vaccine manufacturers in the world are Sanofi (France) and Clover (China).\n\n>Clover is the first company in the world to disclose a 2019-nCoV vaccine  candidate that can successfully be recognized by antibodies produced by  previously-infected patients, supporting that S-Trimer has preserved  the native structure of the viral spike (S) protein and thus may elicit a  protective-immune response as a vaccine. This work was carried out with  the support of leadership teams from Chengdu Hi-Tech Park and Chengdu  Clinical Center for Public Health in China.\n\nGuess who's licensing Dynavax's adjuvant for their vaccine: Clover\n\n>Dynavax and Clover Biopharmaceuticals Announce Research  Collaboration to Evaluate Coronavirus (COVID-19) Vaccine Candidate with  CpG 1018 Adjuvant\n\nOther companies or institutions licensing CpG-1018 include:\n\n* Valneva (France)\n* Sinovac (China, was one of the first to have swine & bird flu vaccines)\n* University of Queensland\n\nAdditionally CEPI (Bill & Melinda Gates funded) is a collaboration partner of Dynavax.\n\n# There's another partnership.\n\nNIH + Dynavax + Medigen (Taiwan)\n\nIt was disclosed by the WHO (link: [https://www.who.int/who-documents-detail/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines](https://www.who.int/who-documents-detail/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines)). It's strange that there's no PR by either Medigen or Dynavax about it yet. This partnership is huge especially because the NIH is involved.\n\nThe involvement of Dynavax was posted by the WHO on May 5th (Medigen + NIH was already disclosed by both parties in February). It's funny how the price of Medigen rose by almost 100% on large volume since the beginning of May on no news. Is the adjuvant working very well in their current animal testing, maybe?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/94hr246uyc151.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=a129383125fc7c6a7202683dc0f79769245d8776\n\nShort term there are several catalysts:\n\n* Medigen + NIH + Dynavax official PR (many people are not aware of that partnership)\n* Breakthroughs with CpG-1018 by either Clover, Sinovac, Valneva, the University of Queensland or Medigen\n* CEPI or NIH funding to accelerate mass production of CpG-1018\n\nI'd shoot for shares if you have a lot of money and for July or Oct options (strike 6-10) if you don't or just want to yolo.\n\nPosition:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/44lfchv4zc151.png?width=785&format=png&auto=webp&s=97fcaa2d347a98b618e81f7df9d8f92f83ac0134\n\nAs always, this is just DD and not a solicitation. If you lose money due to your mental retardation and listening to strangers on the internet, that's that your problem.\n\nGodspeed tards", "created_utc": 1590607497.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/grqf0a/dvax_the_most_undervalued_covid19_vaccine_player/", "is_self": true}
