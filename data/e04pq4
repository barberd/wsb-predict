BUT, in my reading of what he showed, went largely underappreciated by the mainstream. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo one is buying these for hauling for construction, paint business or other trade work. This is a personal \"fun\" truck. His swipe at Ford is cute, but people who buy F150 for actual hauling is not his target audience.\n\nSo what does it have going for it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Its unusual visual design will not stop people from buying the truck. In fact, it adds a \"cool\" factor for the younger well-to-do crowd and those who see themselves as paramilitary or with military connections. You will see these outfitted as modern stealth fighter jets. Matte black spray or wrap (if only we could get hands on [Vantablack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCI2KYhC8vk) finish!) will be one of the top choices . If anything this truck reminds me of two vehicles and both of them are cool - DeLorean and the APC from the Aliens (used to ram the Alien).\n2. Performance for a truck is unreal. Sub 3 second 0-60mph will be a an attractive enough spec for many car enthusiasts just so that they can shame sports cars at traffic lights. Even the cheapest version will outrun many gasoline powered sporty looking cars.\n3. Bulletproof panels, though not intentionally and minimally ? Even though it's not designed for this purpose, at $40K NEW car with warranty that can stop a 9 mil as long as it doesn't go through the class is going to be popular overseas. Places like Russia, China, Mexico, etc can absorb all Cybertruck manufacturing capacity. If they actually improve the glass - these will become extremely popular overseas.  Again - this is not a competition to an actually armored car, but at this price it is a very nice feature that may sway a certain group of buyers. \n4. They have a built-in compressor, air suspension, ramp in the gate, and 120v outlets making them excellent for a weekend camping trip vehicle. People with money who have active lifestyle and are into surfing, biking, snowboarding, skiing, etc will like this truck.\n5. Every rich kid and their dad will want one of these in their collection because of all the unusual features it offers over regular cars.\n\nI really think this addition to the lineup and model Y will take Tesla to even higher territory. Elon is not thinking next step when playing this game, he is looking several steps ahead of competition. He doesn't want to go head-to-head on the terms of other car manufacturers, he will be pushing the boundaries and this is why this Meme stock is going to be going higher and higher. This dip after the presentation is short-sighted and will result in a bigger run up later in 2020.", "created_utc": 1574445950, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e04pq4/tsla_cybertruck_is_underappreciated_and_will_be_a/", "is_self": true}
