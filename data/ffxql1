{"id": "ffxql1", "title": "Biotech (DD): Potential 50% upside within 2 weeks on BMY.RT", "selftext": " **TLDR: buy BMY.RT for potential 50% upside on or before 3/25.**\n\nIn January 2019, BMY (Pharma company) YOLO'd into CELG (then the 2nd largest biotech) with a $74 billion acquisition. Every CELG share was exchanged for $50/sh and one contingent value right (\"CVR\"), which are traded under the ticker \"BMY.RT\". How it works is like this: if CELG gets 3 specific drugs approved by certain dates, the shareholder receives $9 for each CVR. If those drugs aren't approved, then the CVR holder gets nothing (i.e., binary real option).\n\nThe reason I'm bullish right now is that the first of the 3 drugs (ozanimod for multiple sclerosis) is about to get approved on 3/25. Before the acquisition, CELG fucked up the application for this drug and received what's called a \"refusal-to-file\" letter from the FDA. Importantly, since BMY took over they have since corrected the application (it was accepted by the FDA) and is set for a yes/no decision on 3/25. This drug was highly effective and had good safety/tolerability in its Phase 3 studies. Hence I expect it to be approved without any delays in less than two weeks.\n\nAs a general rule, once a drug reaches this stage it has a \\~90% chance of being approved. Let's be ultra conservative and assume all 3 drugs are being ascribed an 80% chance of approval. By that logic, the CVR should currently be priced at $9 \\* 80% \\* 80% \\* 80% = $4.60 or +50% upside. Once Ozanimod is approved on 3/25, the NPV should go up to $9 \\* 80% \\* 80% = $5.76. I believe the reason it's sitting at a discount is due to time value of money (dead money in between catalysts). However, we avoid that problem by getting in and out right around the approval date.\n\n[Link](https://imgur.com/a/qnkiQyz) to my modest-sized position.\n\nSource: Used to be biotech analyst", "created_utc": 1583772983.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffxql1/biotech_dd_potential_50_upside_within_2_weeks_on/", "is_self": true}
