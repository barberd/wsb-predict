That means they kept getting more new cases every day for almost 2 weeks.\n\nThose people were already infected when the lockdown went into effect.  It took about 12 days for them to get sick enough to seek treatment and get diagnosed.\n\nHubei province only had about 400 cases when it went into lockdown. It was up to about 40K cases when new daily cases peaked 12 days later. \n\nRight now, there are [12 European countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_Europe#Pandemic_by_country) with more than 400 COVID-19 cases.\n\n[European Countries with \\> 400 COVID-19 Cases](https://preview.redd.it/rzlwc7fkizm41.jpg?width=733&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7ceda291ed8f3442c0a01e92953228fc9b6d5231)\n\nItaly has been in lockdown since March 9th.  Spain and France announced lockdowns starting March 14th although anecdotal evidence (i.e. stuff posted on reddit) suggests at least France isn't taking it seriously.  The US has 3700 cases too, btw.\n\nCoronavirus is spreading at different rates in all of these countries though.  It's faster in Spain and Switzerland, and slower in Italy and France.\n\nItaly is actually the European country with the slowest growth rate.  Remember - that's not because they're in lockdown.  Lockdown won't affect the new case numbers for another week due to the 12 day delay between infection and reporting.\n\nI calculated the average growth rate over the past few days for the western countries with the most cases.  Then I projected the number of cases out for 12 days from today (12 days from lockdown day for Italy).  Here's what that looks like:\n\n[Projected COVID-19 Growth Rates - Europe & US](https://preview.redd.it/0ilei08ybzm41.jpg?width=1387&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=553f551e884c4785c5000af220f8e1dbb7816a3c)\n\nNote:  the table in the chart says \"Projected Cases 12 days after Lockdown\" but that's only true for Italy - for the rest it's 12 days from today.\n\nItaly will get up to around 70K cases before it slows down, assuming their lockdown is as effective as China's.  They didn't shut most businesses until 2 days later, so it might take longer before it slows down.  We'll know in about a week how well their lockdown worked.\n\nIt will be worse for the rest of the countries except possibly the UK, though it will still be worse than Hubei.\n\nIt looks like Spain will be the worst affected.\n\nSwitzerland is trending to overtake France in about 8 days due to it's higher growth rate.  That's huge when you consider France has 8x as many people as Switzerland.\n\nThese countries all need to start taking lockdown and containment advice from China, Korea and Singapore.  The big EU countries are about the size and population (\\~60M) of Hubei provice.  Europe will have at least 5 major countries with epidemics worse than Hubei by the end of the March.\n\nTLDR:  Spain, Germany, Switzerland, France, the UK, and the US are going to have more COVID-19 cases than Hubei by the end of March.", "created_utc": 1584345203.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjhbic/dd_the_coronavirus_pandemic_is_going_to_be_much/", "is_self": true}
