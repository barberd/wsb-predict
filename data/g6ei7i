{"id": "g6ei7i", "title": "Ultra Bear - (Quality- no TA) DD inside", "selftext": "Hey y'all,  \n\n\nThis is the bear case I am writing out going forward past this earning season. The TL:DR is at the bottom for strikes and dates.  \n\n\nSo - let's pretend none of us are epidemiologists and none of us know what the fuck a R factor is or any of that \"mathlete not an athlete\" shit is. We only have the data at this point in time looking backwards, and we are going to extrapolate looking  forwards based on policy thus far.  \n\n\n Let's get an understanding first of where we are in terms of price. Even ol' Warren B (B-W skillet, as it was), will tell you that the most important thing about buying an asset is what price you pay. At the top of the market we were around \\~18-21 P/E ratio for the S&P. That is SPY 330. Now before all of you tune out, especially some of the smarter commentators, I am only pointing this out in super vague terms. I understand you can fuck this number with valuations to the point where it's absolutely meaningless ( Looking at you Dominoes pizza you fucking whore. GO DOWN ON ME. GO DOWNNN).  \n\n\nNow, let's bring the argument to where we are today. No-one is consuming like they were even 2 months ago. That's fine you might say, markets are forward looking. That is TRUE. The markets are not omniscient, and are mostly random static noise. It's like the temperature today, you couldn't have predicted it a year ago, but if you use weather models you know it's going to most likely fall within 1 or 2 standard deviations of historical models. That's fair.  \n\n\nOk, so we are in the midst of a pretty dismal earning seasons, but nothing is really moving. That's fine - and it makes sense. The market doesn't behave like some drunk driver swerving at the last moment to miss the old lady and hit the barrier. It's forward looking - i.e. it crushes that old lady like a baby being born in the squat position on a concrete floor. So right now, we have on the P/E value (it doesn't matter what the absolute value is) on the SPY saying we are only \\~17% below the highs. That's fine, it's baking in some profit later, pre-empting the concrete hiccup that is the sordid tragedy of your 4/24 puts.\n\nNow you know where I am coming from in terms of 'historical' prices. You were happy to buy at \"X\" p/e (feb 21st 2020), so if things return to normal within say, 5 months you should be very comfortable buying at  X-17%, knowing that discount will evaporate over time. Especially if your one of those dollar cost averages over time folk, you should be quite content.  \n\n\nHowever, there are two things that should be clawing at the back of your mind. The first  -   \n\n\n1) if things(economy) are opening up, why is gold still going up, but the 10 year treasury is still around \\~.6%, and stocks are going up? There is a dichotomy of truth happening here, but more on that in a bit.  \n2) If no-one is spending money, then PRESENT topline revenue is taking a massive hit. So the valuations at the present day (i.e. what you are looking at) are future forward looking. They are discounting this virus as something like a service interruption, not a paradigm shift.    \n\n\nOk I got this far, and I realized how far down the rabbit hole I was. There will be a series of like 15 links at the bottom if you want to read further about how I came to my conclusions. For the 5 of you who will actually read it, let's just DM and discuss.  \n\n\n  \nSo here we are, opening the US and at max optimism. What I'm about to tell you next is 100% contrarian, and has to do with ONLY how many folk have been infected. So. The US has 350 million or something people. They've tested  some X amount of folk, with 800K infected.  \n\n\n [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/21/coronavirus-cases-are-likely-10-to-20-times-higher-in-us-than-reported-former-fda-chief-gottlieb-says.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/21/coronavirus-cases-are-likely-10-to-20-times-higher-in-us-than-reported-former-fda-chief-gottlieb-says.html)   \n\n\nNow. Let's suppose the even highest limit of this estimate was true. If 8-16 million people have already had this virus and the death rates are what they are - that would mean to reach a herd immunity of 60% of the population you would also need to multiply the current death toll (at the finality of the virus) by a multiple of 10/20 times. Do you honestly think policy makers will let that happen? OR do you think it's reasonable these shutdowns continue for a SECOND time, crushing the optimism in the market. With a three week incubation time, look for logarithmic progress in the virus say two weeks after lockdowns end.  \n\n\nTL:DR; CDC/WHO don't make shit up, virus causes second lockdown by July 13th due to re-infection of remaining populace (it won't be July 4th for obvious reasons) - but it will be clear by then where we are at. Markets haven't priced this in.  SPY 235 08/10.", "created_utc": 1587608386.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6ei7i/ultra_bear_quality_no_ta_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
