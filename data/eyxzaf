Well, I was all in on TSLA during most of that time.\n\nThen november 2018, I chose to buy AMZN, because I hoped Papa Bezos was doing to pump the stock to the moon. Suffice to say that since, the roles have inverted, AMZN has been stuck while TSLA is going to Mars.\n\nI'm gonna put an end to this because I know the market is conspiring against me. I'm gonna sell AMZN and buy TSLA. Take this as a warning.\n\nAlso, I had AMD at like 4 in 2013 and sold it for about half a two years later", "created_utc": 1580853715, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eyxzaf/tsla_going_down_amzn_up/", "is_self": true}
