{"id": "gitgmh", "title": "The viral DD - discussion", "selftext": "We have seen a lot of \"pump and dump\" style viral news.\n\nWhether it's hydroxchloroquine or the remdesi-desi-vir(as trump calls it), treatments have show promise only to find they have serious side effects negating any positive effects. Honestly from a science perspective a lot of it has been bullshit \"pump\" for the laymen that doesn't know better. I just have a bachelors in bio, but it's easy enough to see through.\n\nThere is however one promising treatment / mitigation that is out right now, and FDA approved and if you are under 50, you've likely already had it.\n\nThe MMR vaccine.\n\nMost of the evidence is correlation right now but there is some solid science behind it.\n\nThe science:\n\n1. Basically the rubella virus has about 29% similarity to covid-19. Basically you look at the genetic sequence and compare them which is easy enough to do.\n2. Rates of hospitalization and death are strikingly higher in 55 years or older people\n3. MMR vaccine has very low side effects, autism study was faked by a lawyer in Britain with a financial interest that has since been disbarred.\n\nThe theory:\n\nEssentially it boils down to that the antibodies your body develops against rubella help you fight the coronavirus, so while you will get infected, you end up with a milder form of the disease.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. If you are under 55, you've likely had the MMR two dose vaccination\n2. US military gets two dose MMR vaccines regardless if they've already had it or not (and that battleship that was in news that got infected showed a super low hospitalization to infection rate). Granted military is a sample of younger and healthier people, but still.\n3. Kids have very less severe reactions to coronavirus and the antibody titer for rubella can decline with time, see a random study I googled in the last 5 minutes. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3255950/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3255950/)\n4. Studies of rubella immunity shows higher immunity to rubella after recovery from severe cases of coronavirus: [https://www.sciencetimes.com/articles/25417/20200422/29-percent-similarity-between-coronavirus-rubella-virus-help-mmr-vaccine.htm?fbclid=IwAR2PVSDqZbO0hRY0fHONGAuvUwUTjqpIGPAOWKxZiACdkfpbbDW1t3QAk08](https://www.sciencetimes.com/articles/25417/20200422/29-percent-similarity-between-coronavirus-rubella-virus-help-mmr-vaccine.htm?fbclid=IwAR2PVSDqZbO0hRY0fHONGAuvUwUTjqpIGPAOWKxZiACdkfpbbDW1t3QAk08)\n\n\"In an attempt to justify their theory, the team studied blood  samples from coronavirus patients in England and studied signs of  rubella immunity in moderately and severely ill patients. Their approach  proved to be accurate when they saw higher levels of immunity among  patients with severe cases of the disease after they had recovered.\"\n\n5. Studies are currently ongoing to match whether the rubella titer (aka how much antibodies you have in your blood against rubella) compare against coronavirus disease severity\n\nSee [https://world.org/MMR-Titers](https://world.org/MMR-Titers)\n\nStudy here:\n\n[https://world.org/covid-19](https://world.org/covid-19)\n\nResults from the study are out in a few weeks.\n\nBasically if this proves out, then it might be possible to get booster shots of a known safe vaccine and let the virus rip through the population without mitigation measures.\n\nSo with that information in mind,\n\nWhat stocks do you see benefiting most from this? The tricky bit is that few weeks timeline will likely hit the same timeframe as when US states that opened too early will need to shut down.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1589351122.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gitgmh/the_viral_dd_discussion/", "is_self": true}
