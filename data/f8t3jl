I have the DD that is going to save each of your portfolios. Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR) is a company that provides liquidity to marijuana growers. In short, a cannabis company will sell IIPR their facility for say, $20,000,000, then IIPR will lease it back to them on a monthly basis. The average length of the leases is 13 fucking years, IIPR has these cannabis companies paying them monthly, every month, for an average of 13 years. Pretty simple shit. IIPR gives these companies funds for the business, and in return they get the land and facility.  IIPR takes the role of a bank here considering that banks cannot loan marijuana growers money. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, here's the interesting bit, IIPR has an earnings call on Wednesday, and they should be able to beat it. For EACH one of the past 6 quarters IIPR has announced a dividend increase, and either beaten or tied earnings. They've fundraised over $400m in the two months or so, and it's expected that they will announce more contracts with more cannabis companies using that money. With the earnings call having good guidance, beating earnings, and a dividend increase on the horizon, this stock is gonna fucking soar. Granted, the dividend increase and contract announcements could come a bit later than the earnings call itself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was $80 a share a month ago, currently about $102, and although it's been hit a little by this shitty market day, it hasn't really gone down much, but what it has done is provided an excellent opportunity for a cheap buy. This should not be hit by the beer virus, as it's a real estate investment company in the States, there's no tangible effect CV could even have. It won't disrupt any supply chains, it won't stop business, nothing gets fucked by the CV, unless of course this shit truly gets out of hand in America, but at that point, you'd have bigger concerns anyways. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIIPR is the only company of it's kind that was able to get a ticker, due to it's affiliation with marijuana companies. No other company of it's sort was even able to get a ticker, and nobody really knows how IIPR got through this process, meaning that for the time being, IIPR is one of a kind, so if you want to invest in marijuana real estate, this is your only fucking chance. Not to mention, real estate is one of the safest things you can invest in aside from gold right now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have $115 March 20th calls for IIPR which are worth about $2.80 each, and I think the stock price will be about $122 at that time. So, we can look at other options that are currently $7 in the money for IIPR and find $95c 3/20 calls that are worth $11.40 each. Meaning, if my predictions are right, and this hits $122 by March 20th, calls currently worth around $2.75-2.85 will be worth at LEAST $10 each by March 20th, nearly a 400% gain. This stock will be how I am rebounding from the past few days, and anyone that wants to join me is welcome. \n\nWhichever plays you decide to make today, good luck autists. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer: The stocks price could continue to trend downwards as earnings approaches, but it shouldn't be anything too significant.", "created_utc": 1582559202, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8t3jl/how_im_gonna_get_yall_out_of_this_mess/", "is_self": true}
