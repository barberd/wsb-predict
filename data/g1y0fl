{"id": "g1y0fl", "title": "Natural Gas going screwy tomorrow \u2014 Straddle time", "selftext": "Natural gas prices are at an interesting spot right now. It's sitting at a multi-year low (around $1.60) due largely to us being in a shoulder season for heating/cooling demand combined with 'rona shitshow 2020 tanking industrial demand. All that being said prices are expected to rise towards the end of the year as the oil crash curtails oil production (and associated natty gas production) in the US. It's hard to say when prices will spike but I expect things to be volatile in the next couple of months. \n\nComing to this week's play. Natural gas storage numbers are announced tomorrow at 10:30 ET and the EIA is expecting a big injection (storage build). With this much uncertainty in the market I expect a big swing (at least 5%) either way tomorrow. If the build is more than expected we might be breaking a multi-year support and breakout hard to the down side. If it's smaller than expected we'll likely head up to at least the 1.7 level. I'm playing a straddle on UNG options expiring Friday, buying EOD today. Prices are at the time of posting. \n\nUNG Straddle \u2014 Exp. 04/17\n\n12P UNG \u2013 0.29\n\n12C UNG \u2013 0.28", "created_utc": 1586976260.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1y0fl/natural_gas_going_screwy_tomorrow_straddle_time/", "is_self": true}
