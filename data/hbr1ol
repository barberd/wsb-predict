I've had limited access to the Internet and I was catching up on my news feeds. Apparently Jim Keller resigned from Intel one week ago, effectively immediately.\n\nI know a lot of you here suck Lisa Su's dick nonstop because you think she was the captain that turned around AMD, and while she does deserve a lot of credit, I have argued on this very subreddit that if it had not been for her bringing back Jim Keller, AMD's unparalleled comeback would not have been possible (I also think the reason Intel is putting out press releases about shifting away from benchmarks is because they know that Zen 3 this fall will utter destroy their lineup - they will be faster in literally every single category of benchmark, not just multicore performance).\n\nJim Keller is well-known in the CPU industry as a legendary chip designer. He designed chips for DEC (Digital Equipment Corp), Apple (A4 / A5), AMD (K6, K8, Ryzen, etc.), Tesla's Autopilot hardware, and others.\n\nThe official press release was \"for personal reasons\". That often translates to health-related issues. I don't buy it. His brother-in-law is Jordan Peterson (yes, that Dr. Peterson), but Jordan's on the mend and recovering from his benzo addiction. Keller himself is healthy as a fucking horse. I think this is related far more to Intel and the managerial clusterfuck that the company has become over the past decade and a half. I think Keller realized he can't do what he did at AMD, which was really shake things the fuck up in order to put together the best possible team for engineering a new line of CPUs.\n\nWhy do I think this? Various reasons, listed below.\n\nCharlie Demerjian of SemiAccurate has long detailed Intel's problems with their 10nm process, along with their management issues. Glassdoor.com has dozens of company reviews from employees of Intel where they talk about blue badge vs. green badge employees (blue badges are full-time employees that are directly employed by Intel; green badges are contractors which far less benefits). You can Google search these terms - \"Intel blue badge green badge\" and read literally page after page of material about how utterly dysfunctional Intel currently is, due to idiotic management practices. Some of the stories are laughably sad.\n\nIntel as a company has a culture of arrogance. How could they not? They've never had a serious competitor in the x86 space, and while they missed the boat on mobile processors for smartphones and tablets - even after Steve Jobs personally approached them and told them to fix their power management issues and improve their power consumption because he wanted to use Intel x86 chips in iPads and MacBook Air lines - they didn't really care because their desktop and server market was so entrenched and they were so dominant that they figured they could live without those markets.\n\nWell now AMD is fucking destroying them on all fronts. Desktop? Yes. Zen 2 is more power efficient than Intel's most recent desktop parts, by far, and approaches almost the exact same performance. Server? LOL, don't even making me fucking laugh... Intel's highest-end server chips are drawing almost half a fucking kilowatt for a 56 core chip. Epyc is pulling 261 watts under load for 64 cores. Laptops? AMD is ahead there now as well, with the Ryzen 4700U chip pulling **half** fucking ***HALF*** of the wattage of its competing Intel chip.\n\nIf you're a bagholding \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b you better watch the fuck out because Intel is going to go nowhere but downhill from here. Its clear that their 10nm process is a steaming pile of hot garbage, with absolutely atrocious yields. You don't believe that? Ask yourself why they haven't shifted production of all chips away from 14nm++++ (however many fucking pluses they've added since 2014) and to 10nm? Ask yourself why only a handful of parts are currently 10nm, and why all those parts are either low-power laptop chips or high-power server CPUs? Simple. Low-power laptop chips are small and there's less chance of shit being fucked up during lithography. Server chips are huge and expensive, because Intel puts all 28 cores on a single chip, instead of \"gluing together\" the chips like AMD does. So out of a single wafer, they may get 300 chips. But with yields so low (in 2018, Intel's 10nm yield was than than 10%, most industry insiders don't think they've even cracked 50% yield yet), they're lucky to get 150 functional chips out of that wafer, and if you believe sites like SemiAccurate, it could be far... **far** lower. Out of those, you have to put 2 of these 28 core chips together to get Intel's high-end Platinum 9200 series CPU, which sells for $10,000 (and which practically no one is buying). AMD has 93.5% yield on Zen 2 process. That means out of a potential 840 chips, 785 of those chips are fully functional. If AMD wants a 32 core chip, they just glue together 4 of them. Problem solved. Congratulations on your 32 core server CPU.\n\nWait for AMD's Zen 3 launch this fall. If you're bold, short the shit out of Intel. If you're risk adverse, buy AMD and hold. Abandon ship on INTL. This fucker is going to crash and burn until at least 2023 (on average it takes 5 years to create a completely new CPU architecture, Intel hasn't done that since the Core series, which was 10 years ago, and when Keller was brought on in 2018, that's what everyone thought he would do).", "created_utc": 1592528662.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbr1ol/get_the_fuck_out_of_intel_and_get_out_immediately/", "is_self": true}
