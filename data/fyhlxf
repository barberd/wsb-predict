Infinite QE is really just a drug that grows JPow another prostate so that he can keep nutting fat bailouts on every undeserving company till their mouths are full and they got a pearl necklace to boot.\n\nWhile y'all got your panties in a twist about the fed penetrating the market with Shrek's dick, you're forgetting that Aunt Gertrude ain't the only one that's been getting a fever lately. With the minimum 1.5\u00b0C degrees global warming that's being predicted, a whole lot of permafrost (soil that is supposed to remain frozen year-round in the arctic) is gonna thaw out. Turns out certain bacteria which form spores (think anthrax) as well as some hardy viruses are remarkably well preserved.\n\nBasically, once it starts to melt a whole bunch of diseases that were running around in Freddy Fucking Flintstone's day are gonna wake up from their beauty nap and come back to buttfuck us. Some of these strains are so different from modern diseases that no one is gonna have any degree of immunity and it will take us a long ass time to develop medications and vaccines to combat them.\n\nFor a virus to inflict maximum deaths, its gotta have a mortality rate around 15% (Ebola was never gonna be a global pandemic because it was a little too good at killing people, not allowing the infected to spread it as much). Basically right now the government is shitting itself fighting the tutorial boss but Isshin the Sword Saint is just around the corner. Given the incompetence of most governments, I doubt they'll learn any lessons for dealing with future pandemics, especially if it isn't a pulmonary disease.\n\n**TLDR** If you didn't manage to cash in on the steep drop at the beginning of this pandemic, you'll have several more chances. Just keep your eyes peeled for news of weird diseases coming out of Alaska, Canada, Siberia, etc.\n\nSource: [http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20170504-there-are-diseases-hidden-in-ice-and-they-are-waking-up](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20170504-there-are-diseases-hidden-in-ice-and-they-are-waking-up)", "created_utc": 1586531535.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fyhlxf/cashing_in_on_the_next_pandemic_aka_rise_of_the/", "is_self": true}
