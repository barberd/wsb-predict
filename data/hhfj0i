Say it with me. \n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m not paying for the product, I am the product\u201d \n\nThen say that shit again because in today\u2019s world your data is way more valuable than that worthless paper shit in your wallet. \n\n\nThen google citadel. They\u2019re a high frequency trading firm that buys your data from brokers like robinhood, webull, tastyworks and tdametitrade. They take your trade and front run it, scalping a few pennies here, a dime or a nickel there. \n\nFrom what I\u2019ve read these algorithmic fucks actually pay close to 50\u00a2 ***per order submitted***\n\nThis means anytime you send an order to market someone at citadel spends about fifty cents to see what it is. This is where it gets fun. \n\nI propose we all submit order after order all day every day. Let\u2019s do some math. \n\nRetard army 1.2m strong. \n\nEstimate 50 bogus orders per day. (Retards don\u2019t have the staying power to actually DDoS these fucks)\n\n1,200,000 x 50 x .5 gives us $30,000,000 in fees for citadel to pay. This is likely a drop in the bucket but here\u2019s the kicker. The data won\u2019t be actionable because we picked bullshit trades like spy sell 420.69!\n\nLet\u2019s bring some $ROPE to the scalpers.", "created_utc": 1593355369.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hhfj0i/lets_all_gangbang_the_hft_firms/", "is_self": true}
