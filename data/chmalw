His shareholders are the people most likely to grab his attention. Yesterday, ya boy (me) bought two calls that expire next week\u2014therefore I am a shareholder and Elon will care about me...then I can influence him.\n\nI have compiled a comprehensive list of multiple-pointed plans that can help us influence Elon Musk to give us some tendies. You need to understand that Elon is like a reverse vending machine that gives you money, and right now he\u2019s just broken\u2014so we need to influence him and get back to getting tendies.\n\n**Plan A:** Get him to call someone a pedophile on Twitter. Simple, yet effective. Just tweet him a question about Jeffery Epstein and sit back and watch. (Chance of success: 88% // Estimated price movement: $56)\n\n**Plan B:** Find him in person and ask him to buy shares of TSLA. Elon is a great guy, he cares about us. So when you see him, sit down and have an intimate conversation with him. Ask him to buy a few million shares. Gently rub his thigh. If worse comes to worse, he might just hand some cash and tell you to find a motel for the night. Best case scenario, he hands you cash for a motel, and then tweets about how you might be a pedophile. (Chance I\u2019d success: 100% // Estimated price movement: $51)\n\n**Plan C:** Ask Elon to print Beyond Meat out of the TSLA CD trays. Nobody uses CDs anymore, creating new forms of mass and printing food out of it is the new rave. Turn those CD trays into chemically grown meat buffets. May not work if Tesla\u2019s do not have CD trays, but maybe an external part that can connect via Bluetooth or USB would work. Coin flip Chance at success, but massive gainz. (Chance of success: 50% // Estimated price movement: $600+)\n\n**Plan D:** Convert Teslas to run off of coal. The president is a massive supporter of coal, and we have all this coal laying around that nobody uses anymore\u2014maybe daddy Elon should use it to run his cars. No more charging stations, no more coal plants closing. The president will definitely make this a law if we tweet some solid memes at him. (Chance of success: 71% // Estimated price movement: $12)\n\n**Plan E:** Drug Elon and video tape it. This worked for Joe Rogan when he was a desperate bagholder. Now he owned a Tesla\u2014think about that. TSLA price skyrocketed out of sheer pity for Elon after seeing him drugged like that. Better drugs may yield better results. Nobody really knows. (Chance of success: 100% // Estimated price movement: $90)\n\nAny one of these will bring us the tendies back. Elon cares about all of us shareholders. We just need to connect with him on a personal level.", "created_utc": 1564053111, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/chmalw/multiplepointed_plan_to_get_tsla_back_to_280_by/", "is_self": true}
