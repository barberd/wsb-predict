{"id": "gjsvuw", "title": "$BILI-NG $BILI-NG This Dragon is a Green Rocket Ready for Launch", "selftext": "Alright you cum-guzzling degenerate gamblers, here's a great damn opportunity for a big green dick to slap you in the face, so listen up.\n\n$BILI is a Chinese media company that operates the Bilibili video-sharing platform and produces mobile games for a Chinese audience. They specifically focus on catering to Gen Z kids in China who play those \"officially licensed\" mobile games that are pay-to-win, and Bilibili the platform is primarily centered on gaming and animations, though it has expanded recently to include more areas of interest. Think of it as Chinese Youtube, if Youtube wasn't the monopoly it is and instead was just the biggest fish in the pond. Like Youtube, they also have a live-streaming component that allows people to donate to streamers, while Bilibili takes a cut.\n\nI dumbed it down for you morons but you should get what this means. Same logic behind why gaming companies boosted; people are spending more time on their phones playing games and consuming content. That means more ads are being seen, more in-game purchases are being made, more people have more time to simp for e-girls and pay for other degenerates to play videogames they're too lazy to play.\n\nNow I know what you're thinking. $LK. Some of you dolts got burned when that coffee cup fell over in your lap, and now you think every Chinese company that moons is a test of how well you can edge. Well if this was another Luckin' Coffee, would Sony invest hella money? No! So shut the fuck up! Cause that's exactly that they did,\u00a0Sony bought a stake of $BILI worth $400 M. That's no small-cock move considering that BILI's market cap is just above $10 B. And they print too. BILI has consistently posted annual revenue growth, with FY 2019 ending with revenue just under $1 B. In the last quarter alone,\u00a0BILI had almost $300 M in revenue, one of their most successful quarters yet. Furthermore, as revealed on\u00a0the 2019 SEC filing, BILI has made continuous efforts to diversify their business and this effort has clearly paid off considering the rapid growth in BILI's other sectors.\n\nBut wait, there's more! This week, BILI reached an ATH of 31.17, and that's only two weeks after the COVID-19 crash in March brought it to a low of $25. Since it's IPO at $9.80 in 2018, BILI has gone up 212% and looks intent on keeping that momentum up even despite 'rona bringing the markets down. Even since January of 2020, BILI has gained $8 to hit $30 per share, and a positive earnings for this quarter could easily send it up further. Point being, my fellow addicts, there's a green dragon on the side of the next moon launch.\n\nUnfortunately BILI only has monthlies, so option action is limited BUT there should be a run up to earnings. I'm bullish on BILI's future in the long term since I think they are well placed to corner the Chinese video-sharing market, so even taking long calls on $BILI may be desirable.T hey report AH on Monday 5/18. I've got my 6/19 40c and my tickets to tendie heaven, and there's plenty of room on this rocket.\n\nTL;DR: $BILI 6/19 calls. Personally I have 40c. $BILI's stake in online media in China, thanks to COVID, should see a nice increase. They're damn solid and look like they've got room to grow\n\nDisclaimer: None of the above is financial advice. Don't buy options just because some random tells you something; do the research and make an informed decision for yourself. The reason I'm making this post is because I\u00a0think\u00a0there's something here, but I could also be dead fucking wrong or lying. You see numbers, look em up yourself; you see news stories referenced, look em up yourself. Take responsibility for your financial decisions and make decisions based on your personal risk tolerance. No one is forcing you to buy or sell.\n\nPositions: 5/15 NVMI 45c; 5/15 OUT 10p; 5/22 M 4p, 6/5 TTWO 160c; 6/19 BILI 40c.
