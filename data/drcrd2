Long $Rope and short Robinhood.", "selftext": "TLDR; RH wouldn't let me close out 4 Iron Condors Friday, so my account closed at $14. Saturday morning it changed to $414 but my buying power is negative $122,000. Am I the most retarded WSB member? Is this going to be the single biggest percentage loss in WSB history? Should I legitimately kill myself? Does this not all fall on the risk management department at Robinhood? Guh. \n\n\nEvidence of potential Loss: https://imgur.com/gallery/nffw66k\n\nSo, last week I opened 4 $SPY 299/300/303/304 iron Condors last week for a credit of .48 a piece when my account was at $214. My Max loss should have been $52 a spread at expiration. I didn't plan on holding to expiration, but my Max loss should have been $208. \n\nWell, Friday Robinhood wouldn't let me close the spreads because they said I lacked the required buying power(which should be impossible) to close the trade. Robinhood also made no attempt to close the trade either to prevent assignment risk. \n\nWhen the market closed Friday, I checked and my account was at $14 with $6 buying power. It stayed that way all day Friday. I checked it Saturday and I suddenly had $414 in my account, but my buying power was now $-121,000 because of options collateral that Robinhood knows I don't have. \n\nIn conclusion, I emailed Robinhood and told them I'm not responsible for this shit. I don't even know how to exercise an option and my poor ass definitely should not be allowed to take on a position with a risk of $122,000.", "created_utc": 1572842989, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/drcrd2/this_may_be_the_most_retarded_thing_that_ive_ever/", "is_self": true}
