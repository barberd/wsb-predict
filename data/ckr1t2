Gotta feeling this euphoria isn\u2019t gonna last through end of next week when China trade talks fall apart and global slowdown becomes a concern. Also bought puts on overbought stocks AYX and RH. Still holding in long term puts for BYND but bought some short term 9/20 calls with $180 strike to play the upside swing.", "created_utc": 1564678708, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ckr1t2/going_net_short_on_todays_euphoria/", "is_self": true}
