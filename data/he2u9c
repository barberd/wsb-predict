Why do DD when you can see what stocks people are heavily investing in? \n\nRecap \u2013 S&P 500 gained 0.7% today, with the Nasdaq gaining 1.1%. MSFT hit ATH of 200.57. The U.S exceeded 30,000 new cases on Saturday for it\u2019s highest daily level since May, but some areas are reporting lower infections. There is an increasing rate of infections among younger individuals. The Existing Home Sales report declined 9.7%, it\u2019s the third straight month of declines. \n\nFriday\u2019s picks all faired reasonably well. KPTI declined -.10, (-0.53%). ITCI increased +.47, (+1.86%). NUAN increased +.88, (+3.55%). ENB declined -0.07, (-0.23%). \n\nSONO, a pick from June 17th, had rumors of a buyout from AAPL and increased +18.9%. I took this trade on June 18th after it declined and plan to hold a while longer. FSLY was also reported on the 17th and rose close to +20%. Sometimes patience pays with these picks.\n\nOption Activity Summary for today \u2013 \n\n**Today\u2019s Option Activity Fast Facts (Stocks >$6)**\n\n**Sentiment \u2013 CBOE Put/Call Ratio -** 0.78, VIX: (32.63, -2.49, -7.1%).\n\n**Highest Multiple over Daily Avg (with ADV >1k) \u2013 NVO trading at 24x it\u2019s ADV of 1,061. 25,449 calls and 320 puts were traded.**\n\n**Ticker with Most Contracts Traded \u2013 SPCE with 262,814 contracts traded. 220,449 calls and 42,365 puts.** \n\n**Largest Put to Call Ratio (w/ Option volume over 10k) \u2013**  **FSLR with P/C ratio of 13.1. 10,758 puts and 783 calls were traded.** \n\n**Largest Call to Put Ratio (w/ Option volume over 10k) \u2013VNQ with a C/P ratio of 133. 76,61 calls and 573 puts were traded.** \n\n***MOMENTUM UNSUAL OPTION ACTIVITY -*** \n\n1.  ***Ticker: NVO***\n\n**Spot Price** **: 67.94, +.39 (+.58%)**\n\n**Sector: HealthCare**  **Industry : Biotechnology**\n\n**Company Summary** (from Yahoo Finance)**:** Novo Nordisk A/S, a healthcare company, engages in the research, development, manufacture, and marketing of pharmaceutical products worldwide.

However, NVO recently had completed two studies on obesity drugs. This stock could be decent candidate to buy and hold; however, I think buying the actual options are a bit riskier due to the erratic nature of clinical trials.**\n\n2.  ***Ticker: JNPR***\n\n**Spot Price** **:23.14, -.13, (-.56%)**\n\n**Sector:Technology**  **Industry :Communication Equipment** \n\n**Company Summary** (from Yahoo Finance)**:** Juniper Networks, Inc. designs, develops, and sells network products and services worldwide.
