To all my haters in the WSB chat telling me my plays are retarded as fuck, eat my dick bitch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBought $ABBV calls back when it was around $68 and it surprisingly went up a fuck ton afterward. Literally, all you guys have to do is look at a yearly chart, draw one single line and then go long if it's pointing up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that I've broken the downward spiral curse, I'm hoping I can continue this until I reach my personalized gain tolerance of 600k.
