Fuck off in advance.  \n\nSo i started trading options when i found WSB\u2019s back in 2018 by promptly downloading RH and buying a call at the top of IQ back when it was the meme of the day. Since then i\u2019ve gotten really into trading in general and put in countless hours of learning TA, different types of strategies, the market nuances, listening to podcasts, watching videos and winning and losing. Going from individual memes like NFLX, AMD, and even boomer shit like PFE and BA. \n\nAnd before you neckbeards and prepubescents knock TA i\u2019m talking about support, resistance, trendlines and shit that\u2019s relevant. Not the voodoo magic some of you refer to. \n\nI graduated into just playing the ETF\u2019s like SPY, IWM, SMH and so on. I was basically a permabear veteran during the tradewar of 2019 and took a bear last stand at $304 on this last breakout and got blown up. I slowly built my account back up after licking my wounds and accepting that daddy jpow took the wheel. I was still a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b, but hiding amongst you. Waiting for my triumphant correction to finally get that 10 bagger and the PTD minimum in my account. \n\nI started getting into futures and futures options. Shit like commodities and overall just spreading my autistic wings. Playing oil, silver, gold, T-bills. Taking wins and losses. \n\nFast forward to last month i had a couple strangles when the beer virus news broke. Played the dip we had a few weeks ago and went and got my bear suit back on. I bought monthly and weekly SPY puts, only to have china pooh bear execute market rescue 2020. I averaged down, rolled, and ended up with 6x 300, x2 298, x2 309, x1 323 puts. This basically almost bled me completely dry but i started trading the micro futures and got bent on those. With $100 left in cash and only $69 in net liquidity on my puts I revenge traded some ES 0 day options and got enough back for an M2k contract. The only ones still in play by the beginning of this week were the 309, and 323 puts and enough margin for an m2k. I shorted at the last minute of futures last friday. Market open Monday i closed my puts because IV was so high and didn\u2019t wanna roll, also was in and out of some MES contracts. It was an $800 day for me. \n\nHere\u2019s where the irony starts:\n\nThinking that a 100 point down day was excessive. I fucking went long. And it even gets more autistic - i went long an MES AND an M2k contract. With 0 downside protection, and no stops expecting a bounce and didn\u2019t want to get stop hunt over night. SUREly the bulls would not allow such heresy of a -100 point day. Plus, we have qe that\u2019s not QE, and all the other fuckery that was going on the past 15 weeks. \n\nThis was my moment. The moment i\u2019ve been waiting for.\n\nHAHA SURPRISE. JOKES ON ME. Sure as fuck i wake up, only $10 underwater, ok. Fucking fell back asleep (i\u2019m on the west coast). Wake up to half my account being fucking evaporated. Down another 100 fucking points. Surely we\u2019ll bounce here i told myself. Two -100 point days in a row? Noooooo. Can\u2019t be. Spoiler - there was no fucking bounce. \n\nSure as fuck, we have the fastest correction in US stock market history THE ONE FUCKING TIME I GO LONG on a bounce. I\u2019ve literally waited over a year for this moment, and i fucking longed and got burned. TW\u2019s liquidated my account this morning. Thankfully i\u2019m only -181 with them. But i\u2019m out. I got laid off last week from my job and was excited to be able to trade actively and can\u2019t afford to put anything else in for the time being. \n\n15 weeks of gains lopped off in 7 days. Multiple trillions dollars of value wiped out. No resistance. No bounce. This was fucking insane. At least i got rekt on something historical. Even though i should have been rolling in tendies right now shopping for yachts and negotiating with JP Morgan about getting in on their next cocaine shipment. \n\nThe worst part is i can\u2019t even afford decent booze or things you commonly do while drinking good booze. \n\nTiMe In ThE mArKeT iS mOrE iMpOrTaNt ThAn TiMiNg ThE mArKeT. \n\nTL;DR: get fucked.
