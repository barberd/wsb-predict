{"id": "hfzl67", "title": "WTF is with all the SPY plays?", "selftext": "I\u2019ve been lurking on WSB for a few weeks now, and I don\u2019t understand why everyone is always talking about SPY option trades... \n\nIn my opinion very VOLATILE stocks are best for options trades. I\u2019m talking NKLA, SHOP, HTZ, etc. SPY on average moves 1-2% a day. If I\u2019m doing puts or calls, I want that sucker to MOVE. \n\nCan a fellow autist on here explain some foundational shit to me?\n\nEdit: Alright, alright. I get it. I\u2019m a retard. Appreciate all the comments about volume and premiums. Will research more for sure!
