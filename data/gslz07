Over the last 2 years I\u2019ve been studying finance and investing in the market (studying on the side outside of my major) and I just wanted to ask you guys about this recovery we\u2019re seeing. It just seems crazy to me that we already saw the bottom. I mean on one hand, we just had an injection of TRILLIONS of dollars and seems like we could be seeing a vaccine in the next 6 months..then on the other we have record high unemployment (yes mostly furloughed) but not everyone is going to keep their job and in some cases we could see many more layoffs. As well as the possibility of many small business closures. A lot of people are going to be trying to recover lost wages, businesses won\u2019t be selling as much, etc. Who here believes that we could see another leg down in the market, and why? I\u2019m kind of looking for it, could this be a double top??", "created_utc": 1590726572.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gslz07/asking_all_the_bulls/", "is_self": true}
