{"id": "b4cuz1", "title": "Potentiometer Short play: Ford. Carbon Monoxide leaks in SUVs", "selftext": "People have been complaining about getting sick in their Ford SUVs. Recent tests on driver shows signs of carbon monoxide poisoning. High levels of toxicity which is not good, it can actually be deadly. **THIS IS NOT NEW, THE INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN GOING OM FOR 2 YEARS** Now there are new pushes most recently by Bloomberg. So first of all some recent news story on the issue: \n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-ford-explorer-owners-say-suvs-making-them-sick/\n\nHere\u2019s an old link from 2017. Many cop patrols use Ford Explorer and its not so good when a cop is being exposed to carbon monoxide. Several officers were hospitalized. \n\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ford-rushes-repair-police-suvs-more-departments-raise-carbon-monoxide-n791031\n\nUnlike in a home basement leak of carbon monoxide, this is not *as* bad since you don\u2019t sleep and live in your car. It\u2019s still pretty bad because the long commutes can add up fast. Carbon monoxide is hard to detect without proper instrumentation. A person can not simply tell they are in the presence of it since it\u2019s an odorless gas. There are debates on whether accidents have been directly caused in these SUV\u2019s due to carbon monoxide poisoning however it\u2019s very possible they were. CO can cause anything from dizziness to loss of consciousness to permanent brain damage depending on exposure. I\u2019m not saying the issue on hand is that big but we don\u2019t know. See below for more info on CO poisoning and symptoms. \n\nhttps://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/carbon-monoxide/symptoms-causes/syc-20370642\n\nWhy Short Ford? This news will now start to develop more and more as the owners push for answers. Many owners are not going to want to drive their cars. Though the investigation is and has been underway it looks to be a boiling shitstorm. Ford will likely have to eventually admit to their fault which at the moment there is just an *alleged* monoxide leak because they even tried to fix the issue before but have failed to do so properly. If and when Ford makes the announcement. They will have to recall millions of explorers but that\u2019s not the end of the world. Recalls happen. If the issue is just the whole near the lift gate that\u2019s allowing CO then it\u2019s a simply plug/patch up and you\u2019re done, not s big deal. The worse will be the lawsuits that come along this type of a deal. There\u2019s attorneys probably drafting up cases right now to get a class action suit going against Ford. \n\nOld individual lawsuit regarding same issue: https://jalopnik.com/police-officer-suffered-nerve-damage-after-carbon-monox-1819668340\n\nIs Ford going to **TANK** on Monday? Likely not. Is this going to be their demise? Likely not. But it\u2019s definitely a big issue that\u2019s been brewing up too long now and somethings gotta blow with everything re-surfacing. \n\nTLDR: Ford SUVs had and still show signs of carbon monoxide leaks causing adverse health effects for drivers. Buy puts accordingly if you want. Buy calls to inverse wsb. Godspeed fellow autists.
