We aren't half way through the first round of this thing and Dr. Anthony Fauci said verbatim \"We will have corona virus in the fall...\". Dr. Fauci is a man who has served the last six presidents, and has seen everything from Ebola to SARS.\n\nOK, so what?\n\nSo here's what I'm getting at... people have been working from home. They aren't **driving** to work. From what I can gather, about 95% of people in America own a vehicle, and **85%** of people in America commute to work using their personal vehicle. Here is a website that breaks it down per city...\n\n [https://www.governing.com/gov-data/car-ownership-numbers-of-vehicles-by-city-map.html](https://www.governing.com/gov-data/car-ownership-numbers-of-vehicles-by-city-map.html) \n\nWhat happens when people don't drive? They don't use gas, yeah that's already \"priced in\". Well what else happens when people don't use their cars... they don't repair them. Less people get in accidents, less people need an oil change. Less people need parts. \"Ok well I visit ol' Billy Bob down at Jimmy's Repair Shop and get my repairs done there.\" Ok, well the other 75% of Americans that own vehicles go to a new-car dealership to service their vehicles. \n\n [https://www.autonews.com/fixed-ops-journal/survey-3-out-4-vehicle-owners-prefer-dealership-service](https://www.autonews.com/fixed-ops-journal/survey-3-out-4-vehicle-owners-prefer-dealership-service) \n\nDealerships wrote more than 116 Billion in repair orders which was **1/10th** of total sales for all franchised dealers in the U.S. in 2018 according to NADA.\n\n [https://www.nada.org/nadadata/](https://www.nada.org/nadadata/) \n\nOK, get to the fucking point...\n\nNot only will people not be buying new vehicles, they wont need to repair the one's they already have. This is a double blow to the auto-industry. Let's just say 50% of people get back on the road and need repairs and oil changes etc.. Doing some quick maths, the auto-industry will still lose an additional **150 Million dollars** of revenue **per calendar day,** every day, until this issue is resolved. That's something to consider.
