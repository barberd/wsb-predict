{"id": "bifjcd", "title": "Anadarko, undervalued in bidding war", "selftext": "Anadarko was bought by Chevron for $65 per share but the deal isn't final. If they want to leave Anadarko must pay a 1bil breakup fee.\n\nCurrently at $73 a share. They can drop  Chevron and take oxys deal for $76 per share less the 1bill resulting in a value of about $74.\n\nOn Friday, Chevron said they can add more cash to the deal if that is what Anadarko wants. Stock rose $1 and is still looking bullish.\n\nTheir current price is verifiably lower than what they are being offered, no matter how you slice it. I get that some risk is priced in and shares will tend to hover a little below offer. But they already have a deal with Chevron and have no reason to not ask for ***at least*** $74 per share.\n\nI also don't think it is unreasonable for Anadarko to ask for a match to oxy at $76. They may even try and raise the stakes to 80 or 85 per share. This is still less than their historical max of &gt;100. It is also one step up in resistance level. Not a bad play for Anadarko who was literally just told by Chevron to ask for MORE FUCKING MONEY. It wasn't even Chevron saying they will match OXY. It was Chevron asking Anadarko to write down a bigger fucking number. Who would write down a number less than what someone else is bidding??? \n\nThis will pop when the offer is made. They have like 4 days or something to do it.\n\nI already have calls purchased Thursday. Make your own choices for strike and expiration based on your preference for risk and if you agree with my DD. This is my personal thought that lead to the play I have, and it is not investment advice.", "created_utc": 1556482700, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bifjcd/anadarko_undervalued_in_bidding_war/", "is_self": true}
