They said that to continue to use ThinkorSwim, I have to fund the account with a min value of $25,000 USD by end of June. Otherwise they won\u2019t let me trade US Options. Not even covered calls! nothing at all\nim very bummed about that as my fees ytd alone are approaching $10,000 usd which is besides the point. I tried looking info up on this online but couldn\u2019t find anything.\nAnybody else got a call / message from these guys? \nNow i highly doubt id be able to come up with this kinda sum this fast unless i go yolo on something. What would be a good alternative to thinkorswim in canada?\n\nEDIT1: Hey guys so i totally deserve the heat I am getting on $10k of fees. But as someone pointed out below, when you are selling options, you don\u2019t really worry about the commissions. What ended up happeneing was i ended up getting real burnt on a few bad trades...selling options 5 min before expiry and getting on wrong side of the trade on them. Totally deserved those too for trading like that collecting pennies in fromt of a train.\n\nEDIT2: i guess my real question is did anybody else with less than $25K USD trading US Options on ToS got the call?", "created_utc": 1591927771.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h7by7n/thinkorswim_wants_25000_usd_min_to_trade_us/", "is_self": true}
