{"id": "fefxrq", "title": "DD on Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY)", "selftext": "**Introduction**\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) is one of the oldest pharmaceutical companies - around since 1887. They have just recently went through an acquisition of Celgene (formerly CELG). More on this later.\n\nI truly believe that this company has a lot of potential. Firstly, they were named a [Bank of America/Merrill Lynch Top Pick](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/bristol-myers-is-named-a-top-pick-at-bank-of-america?puc=yahoo&cm_ven=YAHOO&yptr=yahoo) on March 5th and that kind of went under the radar due to the coronavirus news.\n\nThe same article explains that BMY has a buy rating and $75 price target. Shares are currently \\~$60 each, and very much oversold due to panic.\n\nTheir current drug product offering includes 8 different medicines, and these combined sales in 2019 exceeded $36 billion \u2013 each and every product was in the green compared to 2018. Verify via their [Q4 earnings released February 6th](https://bristolmyers2016ir.q4web.com/iframes/events-and-presentations/event-details/2020/2019-Fourth-Quarter-Results-Conference-Call/default.aspx).\n\n**Financial Statement Health:**\n\nTheir December 2019 balance sheet has them sitting on \\~$15 million in cash, and $130 million in assets. Operating expenses is at \\~$12 million, and gross profit is at \\~$18 million.\n\nAdditionally, the company has *SIX* new products in the pipeline that is estimated to bump up revenue by $1.5 billion in 2021, and increase EPS from $6-$6.20 to $7.15-$7.45. They\u2019re laying pipe and even announcing how much it will grow during their **research/development day on April 2nd**. I believe that the shares will explode following that day.\n\nMost pharmaceutical companies trade around \\~15 times their price/earnings multiple, and the new price target will only put them at a 12 multiple. **They are currently trading at only a 9 multiple.**\n\nBack to the acquisition \u2013 in November BMY formerly acquired CELG. This was an interesting move because CELG is currently the market leader (first to market and most effective) in CAR T therapy. CAR T therapy operates by manipulating a patient\u2019s own blood and then using that blood as therapy for treatment of myeloma cancer. This therapy product is called ide-cel, and in December 2019 [Bloomberg posted the positive results of their phase 2 study](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2019-12-06/bristol-myers-squibb-and-bluebird-bio-announce-positive-top-line-results-from-the-pivotal-phase-2-karmma-study-of-ide-cel-in). They are almost ready to submit final FDA submission to get ide-cel into a commercialized state, which would yield huge tendies.\n\nDisclaimer: the acquisition caused BMY to take on Celgene\u2019s debt, and this is reflected in their current debt of \\~$51 million.\n\nNow for the more exciting news \u2013 coronavirus. Come with me \u2013 this is kind of a longer leg. The drug thalidomide (sold as thalomid) was developed in the 1950s and originally served as a miracle drug for anxiety, sleeping, and morning sickness caused by pregnancy. Unfortunately it was determined that this drug caused about 10000 baby deaths. This drug actually is what spawned the generation of the FDA and all of the drug product regulations. Rights to the drug jumped hands several times since then, **but it was acquired by Celgene in 2006**. Through their research they introduced Lenalidomide (Revlimid) that is also used to treat multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndromes. The amazing part is that **thalidomide has actually been linked to some treatments for the COVID-19 coronovirus flu**, as indicated [here](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/7Qi164UOPks9h2ekHsvJyQ) and [here](http://m.wzrbw.cmstop.cn/p/117954.html?from=singlemessage&isappinstalled=0) (translation below).\n\n*Translation: Secretary of the Party Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University used thalidomide tablets to treat pneumonia brought on by coronavirus and the preliminary results showed effectiveness. Patients who took thalidomide daily showed a dramatic decrease in symptoms after 3-4 days, and full recovery and discharge after 14 days.*\n\nWith the [uncertainty that a vaccine may not be effective](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/health/coronavirus-reinfection.html) due to reinfections, a treatment other than vaccination is another important part of dealing with this world event in both the short and long term.\n\n**The Play:**\n\nI am currently betting on the R&D reports on April 2nd. I think realistically this can excite investors and balloon the share price to \\~$65 by then, $75 if they announce anything related to the possible non-vaccination treatment of coronavirus utilizing thalidomide. Right now these calls on 4/3 and 4/9 are less than a buck \u2013 a complete steal IMO.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThis is an older company that is continuing to innovate treatments for high priority illness. They have extremely promising press, financial backings, and their financial statements look healthy. They are currently undervalued and oversold, and top investors already know this. The BMY drug product offering is already incredibly strong and has plenty of gas in the tank to laydown the pipeline in 2020 and 2021. They also hold the rights to Revlimid and Thalidomide which some doctors believe can drastically help treat the symptoms of the coronavirus.", "created_utc": 1583512175.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fefxrq/dd_on_bristolmyers_squibb_bmy/", "is_self": true}
