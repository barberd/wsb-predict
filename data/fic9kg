{"id": "fic9kg", "title": "Short 10Y JGBs and German Bunds", "selftext": "automod won't let me share for some reason, but would like to start discussing the end of the biggest bubble in the history of the world still not popped. Yep, sovereign bonds. Specifically, Japanese and German bonds that's still considered a safe haven in this world full of crashing markets and full on pandemic induced liquidity crunch. People sell anything they can get cash to meet margin calls with and yet these sovereigns have held up remarkably well because people think this only goes up in bear markets. What were the other \"safe\" havens people are now liquidating? One starts with a G and ends with OLD and the other is something something bitcoin.\n\nThe financial crisis and great recession in 08 had arguably been averted by ultra low interest rates where banks borrowed money from the central bank's only to buy long dated government issuances for lit free tendies like the autists that all professionals like to pretend they are not. Nowhere had this retarded behavior been as apparent as in the German and Japanese bond market (at least the most liquid ones)\n\nI won't pretend I'm some expert on repos and leverage on eurodollars like that noob that got all that attention week or two ago but I am retarded enough to make a bet that this trade is in the starting stages of unwinding. At the very least, people will prefer US treasuries with a Fed going zero rates rather than retarded ECB that has set their facility rates at neg 0.4% and Japan with no choice but to keep monetizing to the point they are literally holding 30% of stock ETFs (Google it) to the point these two more retarded central banks are so much more retarded than even our own retarded Fed.\n\nBest part of this trade is the IV on sovereign bonds is retardedly low for these sovereigns (no one expects them to blow out) Bunds is around 10% and JGBs are a measely 6%. In a world where all our retarded SPY puts are around 80% that is a steal.\n\nSo since you've read this far, here's the trades (and my positions linked)\n\nPuts on 10Y German Bunds (ticker GBL in interactive brokers) any strike below 173 with Jun Expiry (next futures roll)\n\nPuts on 10Y JGBs (ticker JGB in interactive brokers) any strike below 162 with Apr or May expiry (more liquid)\n\nI put my money where these thoughts are but that doesn't mean you should. Please don't blame me if central banks somehow keep this bubble going for another 6 months and the most you'll lose is a few thousand dollars in premium per contract.\n\n[positions] https://imgur.com/gallery/LCrSLB5)\n\nEdit:\nMy previous DD on this blocked by automod https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fau18i/puts_on_german_10y_bund_futures/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share", "created_utc": 1584156419.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fic9kg/short_10y_jgbs_and_german_bunds/", "is_self": true}
