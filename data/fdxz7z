{"id": "fdxz7z", "title": "SAR-COV2, The Flu Season Part 2", "selftext": "We all are well aware of the beer virus and have been avoiding eating bats like good boys. But this virus is here to stay. Here in the US of A, we don\u2019t bother spending 3 hours in a smelly hospital free care clinic to get a flu test or a respiratory infection checked up, we go to our local urgent care doc in the box, get some meds and go home. So heres where the plan is, every flu season you see urgent care clinics/pharmacies moon because so many people get a little sick but not so sick they care to waste 3 hours on our healthcare system. Long and short of it is, this virus is already mutating into many strains and vaccines are over a year out at least. No this isn\u2019t some \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b play, we long $CVS and $WBA. They boutta double up on average Americans needing healthcare. \nPositions: https://imgur.com/VwoazVV", "created_utc": 1583426602, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fdxz7z/sarcov2_the_flu_season_part_2/", "is_self": true}
