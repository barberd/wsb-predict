{"id": "b3tds7", "title": "+1 AMD put $25 exp. 3/29- daytrade and profitability question", "selftext": "Question 1) If I bought an AMD credit spread today, and also bought to close a -1 AMD $26 put (that was part of my credit spread), I understand that would count as a daytrade because they are both AMD options.\n\nIf I still own a +1 AMD $25 put exp 3/29 put that is currently worth $17. If it goes up, &amp; I sell it today to close will that be an additional day trade?\n\nI don\u2019t want to put $25,000 into my account with options enabled, until I\u2019ve been trading profitably for at least 2 years. I am asking hypothetically in order to get a better understanding of how this daytrade limit issue works with splitting spreads on put options. Can\u2019t find the answer in my research.\n\nQuestion 2) \nI\u2019d like to get $50 ($.50 * 10) for +1 AMD put  $25 exp. 3/29.  AMD at $27/sh now and with over 50% volatility on the put, I think there is a high probability of AMD going below $25 by 3/29 thus driving up the price of  +1 AMD  $25 exp. 3/29 to around $0.65. In your opinions, (and I know reddit hive mind is not a qualified financial advisor) is this realistic? Why or why not?\n\nAgain, this is hypothetical and I am trying to learn.", "created_utc": 1553189508, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b3tds7/1_amd_put_25_exp_329_daytrade_and_profitability/", "is_self": true}
