I realize I can essentially make unlimited money with this and I already told my academic advisor to bite my dick for giving me shitty classes and that I\u2019m dropping out. I took a shit in the dining hall and threw it at the workers just so I could be sure I\u2019d burn this bridge and I couldn\u2019t come back. Planning on moving to New York City once I dump the $5,000 my parents gave me to use for college on Apple calls. It\u2019s all thanks to you guys. \ud83d\udc4d", "created_utc": 1574323094, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dzg1k7/thanks_gentlemen/", "is_self": true}
