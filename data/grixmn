{"id": "grixmn", "title": "[DD] Wirecard - The EU Volatility play", "selftext": "This is my first DD but I think its a good one for some decent results without too much risk.\n\nPut briefly - Wirecard (WDI) is a big German fintech that is a leader in the transaction industry with a market cap of over 10 billion $.\n\nNow why is it interesting? It's one of the most volatile European stocks rn because its clouded by a potential accounting scandal. KPMG said they'd look into it and they announced certain files were still out of reach and that they hadn't been able to be conclusive yet. The results of the accounting research keeps on getting delayed. In any case its more a dispute between the firm and KPMG on methods of accounting and not straight up lies/number creation.\n\nBasically either KPMG announces they clean and its a green dildo or they announce fraud and its huge red dildo. That's why volatility is mad and I want to play with that.\n\n**Short a put** for September or December at strike price 30 - 40 (WDI currently trading above 90 euros) and you can get a solid 12%-15%(sept) or 18% (Dec)  based on the margin you block. Even if there is a fraud scandal I don't think it will go much under these levels, and even if they do its a solid firm and with great prospects. But yea I really do not see it going under 30 even if there was a scandal and fraud revealed. So yea solid returns imo and not that much risk.\n\nAlso for you autists that only have dollars - dollars is at an all time high vs Euro and Euro probs should go up if the rona ends as expected with a solid European economic recovery.\n\nEDIT: My position: Short 32p Dec2020", "created_utc": 1590583029.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/grixmn/dd_wirecard_the_eu_volatility_play/", "is_self": true}
