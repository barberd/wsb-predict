{"id": "hc3dk8", "title": "CHEGG DD", "selftext": "Sup spergs,\n\nBefore reading on, I'd invite you to do your own DD on this company. The following has been properly formatted to suit the 3-mins reading span of your remaining 69 brain cells.\n\n**COMPETITION**\n\n* Chegg currently stand as one of the strongest players in education space shifts, both in the short/mid run. BNED's Bartleby, Chegg's strongest competitor, operates primarily through its network of college bookstores around the US, but with the school closures, has been forced to use more expensive mediums. Chegg is much more experienced with online platforms, which gives it a massive competitive advantage.\n* Coursehero and Quizlet are also immediate competitors to Chegg, but they aren't publicly traded.\n\n**REVENUE**\n\n* Q1 reports were released May 4: Chegg reported revenues of $131.59 million, which is a year-to-year rise of 35.1%, and ahead of the consensus by $12.11 million. The company\u2019s EPS of $0.22 also surpassed the consensus by $0.05. The share price subsequently mooned 30%, and that only accounts for 2 months of the pandemic.\n* You can make the case that it's overvalued already, but let's not start making cases about TSLA, SHOP, and ZM. These stocks have consistently fucked their bearish investors. If you're not holding this, at least try not to short it.\n\n**INVESTOR EXPECTATIONS**\n\n* Out of all 14 Wall Street Analysts ratings, 11 are bullish on this stock, and 3 are neutral.\n\n**PERSONAL EXPERIENCE**\n\n* I'm a college student myself, and most people in my immediate circle either have heard of Chegg or are using it. Those who use it said it has been a very reliable tool to help them get good grades. Cheating may be a concern that universities start taking into consideration, but imo, those will have little to no effect on the shares in the short/mid term valuation of the stock.\n\nCHGG mooned today by a whopping 8%, which means people are probably starting to hop on the early train of holding this until Q2 earnings happening end of July. Don't miss out motherfuckers :)\n\n*Holdings: CHGG 80c 1/15*", "created_utc": 1592582753.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hc3dk8/chegg_dd/", "is_self": true}
