I am going to start a weekly posting that completely opposites the king himself r/SoRefreshing! Go to his weeklys for the real DD and go to mine to inverse or just giggle. Now, let me start and end with saying I have lost more than 5 digits so I am doing absolutely fantastic baby! I am an autist at heart and I'd figure why not give my fellow autists not what they want or need, but rather something absolutely terribly bad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's start if off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni'll now turn off captalizating bc it hurts and im gonna type like how i do w my frineds. much easier to type like this. anyways i'll mostly do just earnings plays and mostly stocks only. i tried doing options but as an autist i simply cannot undesrtand spreads and box spreads, the only spread i know is peanut butter spread and wow that sound so good right now. ok anyway\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhirlpool - WHR \\[bear\\] $139.06 : i don't like this company one bit. they seem to be doing bad from looking at charts and the way the logo looks pisses me off. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKimberly-Clark - KMB \\[bull\\] $123.55: looks good feels good. i think this company does toilet papers or something and we'll always need to brush our butt or our face. don't ask me why i use toilet paper for my face. but looking form the chart this bad boy barely moves so probably just buy this if you want to gain 1 dollar. aka skip\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwitter - TWTR \\[super bull\\] $34.40: i love this app. i don't care about the charts or an yfinancials. this app always lets me up and gets me hard. yes i love the memesand it's good for news. also it should be at $60+ by now just because of how funny the pepole that use this app are. you'll never see a donkey cow looking bull run on the streets of texas and ram a pedestrian just for fun. wow. heavily undervalue yes buy buy let's pump and never dump.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVisa - V \\[bull\\] $160.16: wow yes. another bull. look at this beautiful boy. other than the mini recession thingy that happend in oct dec this bad boy goes up and up. also think of it thiss way: this thing has like no competition other than mastercard and am ex. discover is trash. also mastercard and am ex are going up. they're all just going up. who is going to disrupt card payments. paypal? hahahaha no. ok buy this it literaly cant go tits up\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nnext one will probably be longer with more stocks but then again it probably won't because i like procrastinating and i need to go to sleep now; it past my bed time muah\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S. WHATEVER IT TAKES (i would go super bull on DIS bc i cannot fuckign wait for endgame and i have the biggest autist boner but i digress)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S.S. i tshought of naming this DD bc i'm pretty sure if u inverse me you'll end up greeen but then again this truly is retarded so i'll stick with shitpost. i wish i was a mod alrady... i love you", "created_utc": 1555920028, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bfzgjf/i_pick_stocks_so_that_you_have_to_week_beg_42219/", "is_self": true}
