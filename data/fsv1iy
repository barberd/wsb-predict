I will then buy 100 shares of AMD and then sell a covered call of about $20-27 (haven\u2019t decided yet exactly the strike price) and will collect the premium. Then I will use that money I have obtained to collect even more margin to leverage me higher. I will repeat this process until I have a mass amount of money. Absolutely no way this can go wrong and nothing wrong with this right?", "created_utc": 1585726200.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fsv1iy/genius_rh_margin_plan/", "is_self": true}
