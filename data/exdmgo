Pocket change for most of you but a chunk of my play around money.  I am just a guy with an internet connection so do your own research as well before dropping loads of money based on what some dude on the internet says.\n\nTLDR:  Stock is down,  fires multiple execs on Friday.  Delivered lowered guidance and reports earnings this week.  Lots of indicators of a blood bath.  Puts and more puts.  They don\u2019t own XFL so that can\u2019t save them.\n\nSo on Thursday after hours WWE fired two of the their c suite executives and issued guidance that full year OBITDA was going to come in at low end of $180m range for year.  Stock dropped 20% of Friday.  Shit barely registered on most radars since the market decided to melt down.\n\nSeemed like a good play for a dead cat bounce to make some quick money.  Until you look under the hood and it\u2019s a case of how the fuck did this stock run up so far.  It has a 3.8b market cap with net revenue of likely under 800m a year.  It\u2019s PE is 93.62 and it\u2019s primary source of revenue is network and cable television.\n\nThe primary driver of its run up was announced deals with Fox for 1b for 5 years for broadcast rights and $265m a year for 5 years from\nUSA.  For a total of $465m a year in content rights,  this is significant increase over 2018 total of $269m.  Extra 200m in income is a huge deal.  \n\nExcept the numbers aren\u2019t quite so clean.  From the WWE investor relations:\n\nhttps://corporate.wwe.com/investors/news/press-releases/2018/06-26-2018-215923315\n\nThe 2020 chart shows $435 with 80m to be negotiated.  Which is $200m more than the 2018 chart.  However it\u2019s projecting $311m for 2019.  End of quarter 3 this year they were at $209m.  So they would need $102m in order to hit the $311 number for the 4th quarter.  In order to hit $435 for 2020 that would be $108.75 per quarter.  \n\nSince these are contracts let\u2019s assume that they will hit the 110m for that number.  So that should be an extra 110m in operating income.  However they issued guidance for $180m in OIBDA.  So they are expecting an extra 108m in OIBDA.  All of which is tied up in the extra money from media contracts with the rest of the business actually declining by 2m.\n\nThat\u2019s their numbers and quite simply put the year to date numbers are some bullshit when it comes to OIBDA because more than half of that number ytd comes from stock compensation which is accounting voodoo to make income look higher than it actually is.  Standardize that shit out and they made $16m of operating income.  \n\nSo if they can translate that extra $110m into bottom line it\u2019s $126m for the year.  They have a 50m share float so EPS for the year in a best case scenario is $2.2 for a P/E of 24 at the current share price.\n\nThat is best case scenario assuming you can drag the extra tv money cleanly from one line to another and all other costs and revenues hold constant.\n\nWhich is almost certainly not the case since for the first time in 20 years we now have a competitive marketplace.  At the same time that WWE was debuting on Fox, a competitor was debuting on TNT.  Shalid Kahn (owner of Jacksonville Jaguars) and his son have launched a second professional wresting organization.  Despite the organization being smaller and without the level of clout, it provides competition for talent and has already signed at least 1 performer away from WWE.  I am not going to delve too far into the details on this as others will likely be far better educated on it, but that means a dramatic increase in costs for labor as there are now realistic alternatives.\n\nGiven how slim margins have been, see the above note of 15m profit year to date,  this is particularly bad.  The new TV deal may give them some breathing room but given that all other segments of the business have been declining quarter over quarter for multiple years  the growth picture is pretty ugly.  \n\nWhich points to this quarters results as being a peak from which things will decline as the broadcasting deal will not increase but other costs appear primed to significantly increase.  \n\nUnder these circumstances firing two of the top three people in the company prior to earnings release looks like a canary in a coal mine moment.  \n\nLooking through the earnings live attendance for events only averages less than 6,000 people and in fact the live performances seem to break even cost or borderline negative.  As these live events provide the content for the television business there isn\u2019t an option to reduce the number of events and maintaining a live production ensures that costs will remain high.  For a company with only 200m in cash on hand that\u2019s a problem.\n\nA negative earnings report at this juncture should cause a run on the stock and the firing of two executives seems to indicate that is exactly what is coming up.  Of particular concern might be if either of the television contracts have opt out provisions as performance has been steadily declining over the past few years.", "created_utc": 1580595537, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/exdmgo/wwe_dropped_20_on_friday_and_still_has_a_ways_to/", "is_self": true}
