Bruce Aylward, senior advisor and international leader of the World Health Organization's China COVID-19 mission, said \u201cThere's only one drug right now that we think may have real efficacy. And that's remdesivir.\" \n\nHere\u2019s all the proof as to why GILD will be shooting up like a rocket over the next few weeks: \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\udcb0\n-Gilead is a solid company with many successful drugs in the market. They\u2019re profitable with a Market Cap of over $87Billion and sitting on about $26Billion in cash. Not to mention they\u2019re a virus specialist. For decades they have thrived on their HIV (a Lentivirus) therapy. \n-Gilead had the advantage since this is an anti-viral treatment while other companies are working on vaccines \ud83d\udc89 that will take way longer to get approved. \n\n\ud83d\udc8aAbout Remdesivir:\nRemdesivir has been used to treat humans against Ebola (a Filovirus). Remdesivir specifically attacks a part of the virus that's common to all coronaviruses including COVID-19. The drug has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity in animal models against the viral pathogens MERS and SARS, which are also coronaviruses and are structurally similar to COVID-19. Bioinformatically, the target of Remdesivir is very similar to that in the SARS coronavirus, 99% similar and 96% identical. \n\n\ud83d\udc8aMore about the drug:\n-Remdesivir has already proven effective in lab tests against a range of coronaviruses.\n-Remdesivir worked against various coronaviruses in mice.\n-Remdesivir has been shown to prevent and cure monkeys (rhesus macaques) afflicted with the MERS coronavirus. [link](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/02/12/1922083117)\n-Remdesivir worked against even the most divergent coronavirus called Porcine deltacoronavirus. [link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682219303010)\n-Remdesivir has been proven to work against every coronavirus tested against whether in lab or animals.\n\n\u2014A U.S. patient and a French COVID-19 patient both recovered after being administered Remdesivir on a compassionate use basis.  (translated with Google translate): \"The 48-year-old patient infected with the new coronavirus and released from the Bordeaux University Hospital on Thursday, after 22 days of hospitalization, was treated with remdesivir, a \"promising\" antiviral, said his medical team on Friday.\" [here\u2019s the article](https://www.la-croix.com/France/Nouveau-coronavirus-patient-Bordeaux-recu-remdesivir-2020-02-14-1301078321)\n\n\ud83e\uddeaGilead next moves:\n-Clinical Trials: Gilead-initiated Phase 3 Clinical Trials Initiating March 2020. Clinical trial results are anticipated in April 2020. \n-Compassionate Use: Gilead is working with government and non-government organizations and regulatory authorities to provide remdesivir to patients with COVID-19 for emergency treatment in the absence of any approved treatment options.\n-Increasing Manufacturing Capacity and Supply: There are currently limited available clinical supplies of remdesivir but Gilead is working to increase its available supply as rapidly as possible.\n-The U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, has initiated a Phase II adaptive, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial into remdesivir as a potential treatment for hospitalized adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19. [link](http://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/coronaviruses)\n-CDC officials told the medical team treating the infected man in Washington about Remdesivir after his condition worsened. Meaning both WHO and CDC are currently recommending this as a last resort compassionate use option.
