{"id": "g5i8gx", "title": "A Beginner's Guide to Oil", "selftext": "Everyone here is freaking out about oil, and literally every post is so incorrect and idiotic that I had to step in and put an end to this nonsense. Full disclose, I'm a professional trader. You might think you are a professional trader, but you're not. Professional traders get paid to trade with someone else's money not waste time lighting their own on fire. This is going to be long because there's been a varying degree of idiocy the last few days and I want to make sure no idiot is left behind.\n\nSo first, you need to understand what a futures contract is. You are basically agreeing on a price to buy/sell Oil at a FUTURE time. For the May contract it is today (4/21), the June contract is roughly a month from now. There are futures that go out for many years. If you trade the June 2024 contract, you are speculating on the price of oil that will be delivered in June 2024. If you make a plot of the prices of these futures contract with the y-axis being price and the x-axis being the expiration date and connect the dots, you end up with the futures curve. The shape of the curve is an expression of time preference. If the shape of the curve is going from lower left up and to the right, then the curve is said to be in Contango. This means that there is too much oil available now and people are not willing to pay a high price for it right now, but are willing to pay more to take delivery later. The opposite is when the curve is going from upper left to lower right. This is called Backwardation. This happens when there is a short term supply shortage. Imagine a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico shutting down oil rigs.  There will be a shortage this month, but things will get back to normal in six months. Currently we are in Contango because there's too much oil being produced, and nobody is using it because of coronavirus. Some of you semi idiots have thought, \"hey! why don't I just buy some front month oil futures and sell some back months and wait?\" Well the problem is that you need to take delivery and store it. This has a cost, and it varies depending on many different factors. If you actually were an oil major and could do this (which they are). This would be called a positive carry trade meaning you get paid to just hold (carry) the trade.\n\nBefore we get further, there we also need to explain the delivery aspect of futures. Some futures like the SP500 futures are cash settled. That means at expiration, you get the difference paid to you in cash instead of getting SPY or a basket of 500 stocks delivered to you. Others, like the CL oil contract, are physically settled. This means that you will actually get 1000 barrels of physical oil at expiration and you cannot refuse it. Furthermore, futures contracts are meant to be fungible, but there has to be some standards otherwise people would just be delivering watered down oil all the time and the whole thing breaks down. The CL contract that went negative is based on West Texas Intermediate (WTI) delivered in Cushing, Oklahoma. There are many types of different crude oils delivered all over the place, but the other major futures contract is Brent Crude. That is oil from deep in the ocean somewhere off the coast of the UK. The reason I make this distinction is because Brent did not go negative yesterday. Why is that? Well because delivery location matters. Cushing, OK is landlocked. There are storage facilities onsite, but they're all full. Brent is waterborne. You can just send up another tanker ship fill it up and park it somewhere. What happened yesterday is that all the longs on CL who did not want to take delivery had to sell, but there was no one who wanted to take it at almost any price because they also had nowhere to store it. Interesting fact, many years ago WTI traded at a premium to Brent because the biggest user of oil was America and it was cheaper to get it in Oklahoma than ship it from Europe. Now it's the opposite. Nobody wants this landlocked oil.\n\nSo what are the implications? May expiration was an anomaly, if you expect to see -40 in the June contract, I can almost guarantee you won't. Longs have seen what can happen if you wait too long so they will sell earlier (as today's price action already shows). Also, the carry trade will get ramped up more. One day is not enough time to find a bunch of tanker trucks, but one month is.\n\nIf all that was too complex, here's an idiot's Q&A mostly collected from yesterday's posts\n\n\"OMG oils is so cheap, it's definitely going to be worth $40 in a few years, shouldn't I buy USO?\"\n\nEveryone who bought USO lately is completely fucked. This is really what prompted me to write this whole thing. USO historically buys the front month contract, waits until it's close to expiration and sells it and buys the next months. This is the exact opposite of the positive carry trade that professionals are doing. What they are doing is called rolling and assuming the world doesn't change soon, they will be losing $10 per barrel per month doing this. Also, they've gotten so large from the retail inflows lately that they've breached max size on CME so now they can only allocate 80% to the front month and 20% to the second month. This is all public info, so basically everyone knows that in a few weeks USO has to sell 30% of the open interest in the front month and buy that much in the second month. What do you think will happen to the prices of those contracts when they go to roll? Also, look at the price of the futures contract for 2024. They are already pricing in $40+ so USO already has that priced in and is just waiting to get destroyed on rolling each month. \n\nThe ETF \"OIL\" just announced they are liquidating.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"OMG oil is negative, let's buy a tanker ship and dump it in there\n\nGood luck sailing your tanker ship to landlocked Cushing, OK. As stated above, this is why Brent Crude is not negative.\n\n\"Well I can just rent a bunch of tanker trucks for next month, can't I?\"\n\nAll the big companies are lining up additional/weird storage capacity for next month. This is why I predict you won't see June go negative unless there are other technical issues like margin requirements and forced FCM liquidations.\n\n\"Some genius bought $10k worth of May 50 cent puts. They are sooo rich right?\"\n\nWrong, options expire the week before the futures. Those options expired worthless\n\n\"Wow I never knew this about CL/USO/life. Is this because the Elite are keeping us down?\"\n\nNo it's because you're too lazy to read contract specifications. No pro trades a product without fully understanding it.\n\nUSO fund prospectus:\n\n[http://www.uscfinvestments.com/documents/united-states-oil-fund-pro-20180228.pdf](http://www.uscfinvestments.com/documents/united-states-oil-fund-pro-20180228.pdf)\n\nCL contracts specs:\n\n[https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/energy/crude-oil/light-sweet-crude\\_contractSpecs\\_futures.html](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/energy/crude-oil/light-sweet-crude_contractSpecs_futures.html)\n\nCL delivery rules:\n\n[https://www.cmegroup.com/content/dam/cmegroup/rulebook/NYMEX/2/200.pdf](https://www.cmegroup.com/content/dam/cmegroup/rulebook/NYMEX/2/200.pdf)\n\nEDIT: fixed typo and added more to Q&A.
