So I\u2019ve been using that within the last couple of weeks because it was linked here in a thread that seemed pretty credible with no issues.\n\nAs soon as market closed today, CNN futures immediately opens to one of those browser crashing pop-ups with no way around them.  Re-open as many times as you want, you will incredibly be a lucky survey winner everytime.\n\nEDIT: When searched in Safari on iPhone\n\nAm I the only one who\u2019s noticed this just happened?  Could CNN and the rest of the news outlets be onboard with falsely propping up this bounce and trying to mitigate any news that hurts their prospects of that? Or am I just drunk and gay bear as fuck?\n\nSPY 210p 4/17", "created_utc": 1585203344.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fp6i6y/dow_futures/", "is_self": true}
