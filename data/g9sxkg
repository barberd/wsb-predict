So long as archrival Microsoft Corp. doesn\u2019t push back the release of its next-generation Xbox, also expected at the end of the year, Sony won\u2019t delay either\" : [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-16/sony-is-said-to-plan-limited-playstation-5-output-in-first-year](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-16/sony-is-said-to-plan-limited-playstation-5-output-in-first-year) \n\nWith Covid potentially affecting this date Jan 2022 $5 calls seem like a safer option - this will give 2 holiday seasons for console sales to increase as some people will get it right on release and then a bunch more the next holiday season (usually when bundles are released at somewhat of a discounted price). With Xbox potentially releasing it's new console around the same time there is no doubt that GME will moon. \n\nGME is down today good time to get in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR GME Jan 2022 $5C", "created_utc": 1588099512.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9sxkg/dd_gme_will_moon_this_holiday_season_due_to_ps5/", "is_self": true}
