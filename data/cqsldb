While leverage in these strategies is off peak levels and there is incrementally less risk now than two weeks ago, they are unlikely to flip rapidly back to buyers, and there is still risk of further supply should trends turn more negative or volatility rise further.", "created_utc": 1565888304, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cqsldb/some_insight/", "is_self": true}
