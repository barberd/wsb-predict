{"id": "fu4lax", "title": "Questrade made marijuana illegal", "selftext": "Questrade was heavily involved in the passage of the [Marihuana Tax Act of 1937](https://www.marijuanabreak.com/blog/when-did-marijuana-become-illegal-in-the-u-s), which effectively banned the consumption and distribution of cannabis in the United States of America. The knock on effects of the passage of this law include (but are not limited to) the United States having more people in prison than any other country in the world, the vast majority of which are incarcerated for non-violent drug offenses, the destruction of families in urban and rural areas alike, and denying the sporting world a chance to bear witness to the true greatness of Ricky Williams, who walked away from a promising career in the National Football League in order to pursue his love of smoking marijuana. \n\nOn its face, it seems patently ridiculous to blame a company founded in 1999 for a law that was passed prior to Pearl Harbor being bombed by the Imperial Japanese Navy, but only if you discount the possibility that QuesTrade CEO Edward Kholodenko is in reality the physical reincarnation of William Randolph Hearst (who passed away in 1951. - a mere two decades before Edward was born). Hearst owned a huge stake in paper mills and was at risk of losing his entire publishing empire in the event that hemp became the dominant printing material in the US. Hearst used his vast network of newspapers to spread racist and xenophobic propaganda that stoked the flames of anti-cannabis legislation, which eventually resulted in the passage of laws that make the possession of an otherwise ordinary plant being an offense worthy of you spending the rest of your life in a concrete cage getting raped by a large man named Bubba. \n\nTl;dr: Thanks for making weed illegal, Edward (or should I refer to you using your the name you used in your precious life, William?). \n\nFuck you.\n\nYour castle is pretty sweet tho", "created_utc": 1585902412.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fu4lax/questrade_made_marijuana_illegal/", "is_self": true}
