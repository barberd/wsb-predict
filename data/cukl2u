{"id": "cukl2u", "title": "Alibaba, Tiffany, and how to score your own real life Becky", "selftext": "Once upon a time I was added to a group full of cheap counterfeit shit from China. LV bags that can pass for the real thing for 7.7% of the price. (Not speaking from experience or anything because counterfeiting is totally a no no) Beats speakers. Rolexes. Everything you can imagine. I just looked at found over 10,000 purchases of counterfeit Tiffany rings that average around $20. \n\nSo if BABA goes up, Tiffany will go down. And after tariff man finishes blowing his load, all of the Beckys of the world will once again have to search for a man to buy her a ring. No China trade? No more balling on a budget. Speaking as a Rebecca, we\u2019ll get desperate enough that we\u2019d even consider blowing autists to keep the goods flowing in. And we all know you all will pump Tiffany up to keep Becky cumming. \n\nIn the meantime go stock up on the fakes. By the time you actually find a Becky desperate enough for you, China won\u2019t be able to send anything over here and she won\u2019t ever question if hers if real or not. Win win win.
