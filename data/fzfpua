{"id": "fzfpua", "title": "Golden Era", "selftext": "**TL;DR - Long Gold**\n\n***Disclaimer:*** *This post is eco-nerd shit with charts. It's about interest rates and gold. Nothing more.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo perfect model exists as to determine where interest rates should be. However, one model exists which implies the real price of gold (inflation adjusted) has a tendency to move up or down, again in real terms, as compared to what the Federal Reserve is doing, or not doing, with the Effective Fed Funds Rate (EFF).\n\nThe model I refer to is [The Taylor Rule](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taylorsrule.asp).\n\nI am going to graph 3 distinct periods in time where either the Fed Funds Rate was either too loose or too tight relative to where The Taylor Rule implied interest rates should be.\n\n1. 1968 - 1980: Loose Fed, Rising Gold Prices\n2. 1980 - 2001: Tight Fed, Lower Gold Prices\n3. 2001 - Present: Loose Fed, Generally Higher Gold Prices\n\nAll data is sourced from [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1968 - 1980**\n\nA positive value for the blue bars represents The Federal Reserve being *\"too loose\"* relative to where The Taylor Rule (TTR) indicates rates should be. During this period, real gold prices rose substantially. **What is important to understand is not so-much how large the spread is between TTR and EFF, but rather if the spread is positive or negative.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[1968 - 1980](https://preview.redd.it/nimztgkhm8s41.png?width=978&format=png&auto=webp&s=63f71cc1d52b7afbcae96806586def96e4992708)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1980 - 2001**\n\nThis two decade plus period provides a view that the Fed was too tight relative to TTR and therefore gold prices in real terms suffered roughly an 80% loss in value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[1980 - 2001](https://preview.redd.it/dbw8sfcim8s41.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=8127308849cd2bdb14cbe11eb5b921db0bc3d384)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2001 - Present**\n\nThis period is unique because it has two added factors: ZIRP and QE. The impact of QE in terms of how this would translate into rates (negative) has been discussed, but I am no expert in this matter. In addition, during the GFC, TTR went negative, implying negative rates. In all, over this almost two decade period, the Fed has been too loose and the bull market in gold resumed. ***Interestingly, a long period occurred where the Fed remained too loose yet the real gold prices declined (from 2012/13 - 2018).*** This could imply this model is less effective in the world of Central Bank accommodation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[2001 - Present](https://preview.redd.it/2gdczcxim8s41.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&s=5da8bd5fff0b5410b938eafef02f78962d368167)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn a final note, this is far from perfect. Periods (quarters) exists where the correlation is broken, however the secular cycle remained intact and that's the premise. This model may be dead or injured given ZIRP and accommodation. We would have to better understand how we could view QE in the context of rates. This said, I still believe we are in a Golden Era.", "created_utc": 1586633314.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fzfpua/golden_era/", "is_self": true}
