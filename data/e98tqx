One of the largest in the world and the phone maker with the highest sales growth \\*jeremy clarkson voice\\* *in the world.* They are selling phones in markets apple can't seem to tap into, incluiding india and the PRC.  \n\n\nNow the real DD is here. These phones seem to have an astounding retention rate. I bought myself one. I never used to look for phones, they are tools. Now I'm catching myself looking a xiaomi phones on the internet all the time. If I get the idea of buying another phone, it's always a Xiaomi, I don't look at other brands. My friends who've bought the phone are the same. Add to that their fucking smart watches selling well (and working on both android and apple devices) and you have an extremely undervalued company with a ton of potential. It's easy to see why given their stupid low prices (like seriously, if you are in the market for a phone fucking check out the mi 9 lite or the k20 pro).", "created_utc": 1576079662, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e98tqx/xiacy_and_why_you_should_be_buying_that_stock/", "is_self": true}
