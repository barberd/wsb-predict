USA has under half the cases from #5 to #9 but yet we have almost double the deaths of them. it seems like either our doctors suck or we are being lied to about the actual number of cases to have that many deaths with so few cases or maybe im missing something", "created_utc": 1583368353, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fdmsmh/usa_corona_virus_coverup/", "is_self": true}
