Looks like CNN is fake news. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/firstsquawk/status/1252438684135129090?s=21\n\n\n\nTLDR: EWY C50 17JUL20\n\nKEP Shares.\n\nAnything exposed to Samsung / LG / or other Chaebol companies.\n\nDD: KJU dying could be VERY good news.\n\nThe [Chaebol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaebol) have a significant problem procuring a cheap labor force in the country. The [South Korean labor force is one of the most highly educated in the world,](https://www.ft.com/content/b5bb3868-3b36-11df-a1e7-00144feabdc0) and therefore every tom dick and harry expects a well-paying office job. (Sound familiar?)\n\nIf the North were to fall or more likely be coerced to reunify. Suddenly a dozen blue-chip industries would have a [flood of cheap labor](https://www.afr.com/companies/north-korea-offers-cheap-labour-great-risk-20180608-h114kv), AT THE SAME TIME they gain access via rail to some of the [most untapped natural resources in the world.](https://nypost.com/2017/07/03/north-korea-is-sitting-on-6-trillion-in-mineral-resources/)\n\nYes, there would be societal problems but the current administration is [pro-unification unlike the previous.](https://www.ft.com/content/0fd71f12-bf10-11e9-89e2-41e555e96722)\n\nI  am not a Korea expert my specialization is Japan, but I know a thing or  two about the peninsula. And A dead Kju is better than a strong live  one AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME. For a lot of reasons.  \n\n\nEDIT: Yes the stock market may go down tomorrow on uncertainty because we don't even know if he is really dead yet. Buy the shit in the TLDR while it's still cheap. That is the whole point of this post is to point out the opportunity. Not to crystal ball SPY tomorrow morning. But fuck it while I am here. Open 281. Close 284 21APR20.
