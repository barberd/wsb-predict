{"id": "b1i37v", "title": "Thank you WSB - Options gain story", "selftext": "Felt like sharing this to give others hope that you can have success if you're persistent (autistic). I failed trading for many years and had many ups/downs, hasn't been easy at all/  don't have fuck you money but I feel like I'm in a good place right now. TL;dr below \n\nStarted trading initially in crypto in 2013, made many mistakes but learned a lot, tried learning options but gave up because it was too hard to understand in 2015... until I started following r/wsb in 2017 and was inspired to learn the ways of the yolo. And so I did. I quickly started trading with around $3000 in 2018 and slowly but surely built my way up to $300 in about 6 months. From their I did build my account slowly but surely.\n\nI headed into October of 2018 with a couple grand and Shorted multiple stocks the whole way down. My style of trading is swing trading and I use deep 1 way otm options to do this (I prefer to use as little capital as possible on options trades as I usually go  for 100%+ gains or 0.  I did well shorting stocks like LB/ fds/adbe.  I ended the year up around 10k and from this point I've been withdrawing 2.5k per month.  I've also stopped going all in at this point and keep extra cash in the account to make sure I never get wiped out. \n\nI closed all puts and started  buying calls December 26th when we were up 2.5% intraday, and the market ended up 5%. Since then I've been mostly buying SPX calls/ AAPL calls and remained bullish since the PPT was put to work. I typically only risk around 500-1.5k per trade. I've had excellent timing on the spx calls over the last 3 months, out of about 10 spx swing trades I've done, they've all been profitable. AAPL was a trade that went wrong and I ended up averaging down over 3 months till I had 10k in aapl, this week I finally closed that position up around 400%. \n\nI'm no where near a perfect trader, I have 100s more trades that aren't note worthy, I made huge mistakes in crypto that could have easily made me a multi-millionaire. And plenty of mistakes trading stocks/options over the last year and a half. \nFor example when I was down to 300$ I went all in on NBEV 5$ OTM calls expiring Sep 21st when Nbev was around $1.50... take a look at the chart. I was busy moving across the country and after holding the options for 4+ months I had considered it a total loss. When the calls went up to $600 I quickly took my profit as I thought there was no way they'd pump $3-4 more  in less then a week. Little did I know there was a huge bubble in MJ stocks as I was unpacking and nbev leaked a cbd oil drink. Could of turned 300$ into 30-40k  if I held till expiration. \n\n\nTl;dr started with 3k went down to 300 and turned it into 80k+\n in the last 5 months https://gyazo.com/1360a8d00afa5dd4ac8da5f9062cd7e8  (I've been withdrawing 2.5k per month/ 5k one month/ some money was on robinhood)\n\nCurrently I've exited all my large positions and am waiting and watching the market to see if we'll move up to new highs or get a much needed correction. \n\n\nThese are my current positions- I know the cvs ones are laughable.  \nhttps://gyazo.com/3463c3c04efc8a124a1e098d1cc20c01\n\n\nPlease feel free to ask me any questions. \n\n\nTl;dr started with 3k went down to 300 and turned it into 80k+\n in the last 5 months https://gyazo.com/1360a8d00afa5dd4ac8da5f9062cd7e8  (I've been withdrawing 2.5k per month/ 5k one month/ some money was on robinhood)", "created_utc": 1552673030, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b1i37v/thank_you_wsb_options_gain_story/", "is_self": true}
