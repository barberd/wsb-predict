A step by step booklet for you to get yo tendies on track, not yo portfolio pushed back\"\n\n--Jowemaha\n\nHuman beings usually overlook the simple in favor of the complicated. The most obvious and most directly causal impact on the price of a good is supply and demand. (Secondarily you have \"sentiment\" which tends to follow price. Thirdly you have growth. Fourthly you have earnings. Fifthly, almost entirely irrelevant, you have \"intelligent fundamental perspective.\")\n\nThe company is selling 1 million shares on the open market \"from time to time\". In addition, after the massive run up, employees with stock options are taking money off the table. In addition, with the price declining this profit taking has only accelerated.\n\nSo far we have covered \"supply and demand\", and sentiment, and we are at growth. The growth is good but not exceeding expectations wildly anymore. So don't expect this to protect us from the much stronger factors 1&amp;2. Earnings are nonexistent.\n\nThe fundamental perspective is debatable. I'm very very bullish but who knows. Remember I said \"intelligent fundamental perspective.\" The reason this factor is so weak is that it is essentially nonexistent.\n\nConclusion: be like a thrifty motherfucker at Chipotle and wait for more dip. Stare down the minimum wage worker until she adds more sour cream. Play this stock short. Stock analysis is easy. Easier than selling rocks. Just remember your five stock factors and the order.
