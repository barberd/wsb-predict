That would add the basis to the taxable account I'd imagine. I could then later claim the loss when I sell them in the future. What am I missing here?\n\nGOD DAMNIT MY STOCKS ARE IN AN IRA, A TAX ADVANTAGED ACCOUNT, FUCK", "created_utc": 1593666000.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hjqpwc/autist_tax_question/", "is_self": true}
