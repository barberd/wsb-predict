{"id": "cszygy", "title": "Confusing names, a spin-off, big leverage, little downside, all in a stock everyone hates.", "selftext": "I just took on a long position on a pharmaceutical company, Mallinckrodt (MNK), that appears to be right around its rock bottom.  I think this complex generics manufacturer could make at least a partial recovery toward its 2015 heights and has very limited downside.  Hoping to get feedback from some other retards.  \n\nI initially found MNK while searching for corporations set to spin off part of their operations in the next few months.  The nomenclature surrounding the separation is a bit confusing:  the company being spun-off will retain the Mallinckrodt name, and the parent company will change its name to Sonorant Therapeutics.  Every MNK shareholder will effectively receive one share of the new MNK and one share of Sonorant, the parent, in exchange for one old MNK share.  They're hoping the transaction will be finished before the end of 2019.\n\nI read a couple breakdowns and as much of the Form 10 as I could, and here are the basics:  the new Mallinckrodt will take over control of the specialty generics business, which accounts for around a quarter of the current MNK drug sales. Sonorant will retain everything else.  \n\nThey're spinning off for two reasons.  Their opioid generics have come under some expensive law suit heat recently, and it looks like MNK is set to pay big for it.  Since generics is no longer part of their company, Sonorant can shed legal responsibility for the suits.  Sonorant won't take the legal hit and can continue operating normally.  (It's important to note that MNK earnings is right around an all-time low.  They don't realistically have the money to deal with law suits). Hopefully, a combination of more focus being poured into the good parts of the old MNK business and freedom from the law suits will cause Sonorant to become more profitable, and appreciate in value.\n\nHere's where it gets interesting.  Right now, it looks like Sonorant is dumping all their problems onto the new Mallinckrodt with no regard for its long term life.  But MNK's current executive team will largely be in charge of the new Mallinckrodt, not Sonorant.  Only the new CEO's compensation plan is available right now--I'm happy that he's getting paid mostly with stock and options--and I'm hoping the rest of the execs will be paid similarly.  It's in their best interest to see MNK succeed.  \n\nThe new Mallinckrodt will also take on a lot of debt to get off the ground when it spins off.  The stock will be super leveraged.  In this scenario, the execs, who are likely to choose stock in the new Mallinckrodt as their form of compensation, stand to make a fortune with the new Mallinckrodt.  \n\nEven though my thesis for the new Mallinckrodt is basically to put all faith in these execs, the downside is not terrible.  Sonorant, free from the suits, is extremely unlikely to \\*decrease\\* in value due to the spin off.  And the new Mallinckrodt is only a quarter of the whole business, so your losses on the new Mallinckrodt are limited to 25% of your original investment even if the new stock goes all the way to zero.  Yeah, -25% isn't ideal, but I've seen worse in the past 5 minutes on the sub's front page.  \n\nDid I mention that everyone hates MNK stock right now?  P/E ratio is like two and a half, when the average P/E for Pharma companies of MNK's size is close to double digits.  What analysts I have seen bother to take a look at MNK on the internet rate it 'overpriced' and 'sell.'\n\nIn my opinion, buy before the spin off for the best value.  I bought around a thousand shares yesterday for 4.50 a share.  Let's see where this goes.\n\nTL;DR MNK is using a spin off to get rid of toxic business.  But all the important people in MNK want to be in the toxic part.
