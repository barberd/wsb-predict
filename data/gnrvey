{"id": "gnrvey", "title": "Huya DD Part 3 STINGER", "selftext": "Interesting Trading Day\n\nHad a good time\n\nGot a nice little notification.  Yes, I want to have a crazy hour with you Vanessa.... \n\nNimo TV, It keeps getting better.....\n\nI'm starting to not believe Huyas numbers. It's got to be more. I straight up thought about dropping diamonds on Vanessa.  Good Job Algos\n\n[You know she wants the DD](https://preview.redd.it/yduk3ttyu1051.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5919df8b7eb25b75d09d729c6f94a154049444c1)\n\nI deleted DD part 2.....  Broke the guidelines.  That was actually a re-write as the original was definitely against guidelines.  I tried to snip enough of it make it compliant.  This one will be, but FYI Golden Retard would have worked.  I know this now as I can replay the day backwards. This DD will  break some of that down.  LETS GO\n\n[Blue Caps Top Middle](https://preview.redd.it/r6sbsiua32051.png?width=588&format=png&auto=webp&s=aede0ff7b6cc55e5146a69e30518ed33386cfc00)\n\nThe Best Day in a Stock EVER the super rare \"Golden Retard\" is over. There will never be a cheaper day to buy up all the shares of Huya. It will just get more expensive every day from an energy required to keep the train moving. I don't know the greek on this but I'm sure there is one.  \n\nNote the BluCaps above especially in the middle top.  Those are Put Buys.  There could be a FEW purchases of these because some gays can't help them selves. Some dudes are just gay bears all the time, dripping with gayness. This shit has an obvious pattern. FAKE GAYNESS.  Someone is carving out a lane I suspect.\n\n[Stinger](https://preview.redd.it/h03584pry1051.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3d12557839bdae9a3cc0c07a2b055f79f00f1d08)\n\nNot a 100% sure when the dude turned his computer on but for sure it was causing interference from 11:30 to 12:30. (Note semi straight upward velocity on the RH view)  It took over the velocity and pushed it first to maybe $19.90 then let it drop I suspect to see the velocity of buy the dip faggots. Did something for a few minutes not quite sure what.  Then pushed to I suspect $20.06, I think a human did the $20.12 transaction.  Dude Snatched puts as he pushed things up.  Not entirely sure what is going on but I suspect it is messing with tendies.\n\n[Note Volume changes first half to second](https://preview.redd.it/2ksjik9g62051.png?width=543&format=png&auto=webp&s=6241569c535dcbb27831cf7fd3e178972cd4eb00)\n\nThis is a good visualization of the computer messing up our goal of snatching the \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\n\nDude comes in. Tests the ceiling. Takes the temperature of the trading situation.  Goes a little higher I assume to set the top and bottom of the channel they are going to try and force us in. He gets the added bonus of scaring off a lot of the actual humans. He purposefully tried to scare buyers so I assume he could get the tendies first. Little Bitch\n\nHuya beat Earnings, Beat Revenue. Up in every category.  SUPER BULLISH = BUY SHARES. They aren't going to get any cheaper and every day you don't buy shares you are going to see additional tom foolery that I guarantee you takes away from our tendies. \n\nThis company just had a slam dunk quarter and has been price suppressed for years.  After hours volume is fake and gay.  We will see what happens premarket and market day. I'm buying, I smell money and I want it.\n\nMy goal is to buy more shares. I still don't have my 1001.  May see what Long Stuff is still good.  Curious about 1/15/2022 saw a couple of nice bags of that one.\n\nCurious as to why the Chinamen didn't Hype NIMO?  Was it a cultural thing? Are they trying to keep it secret?  If so why?  We need the DD on that. I don't know about you but I'd be rubbing that shit in everyones face pumping the hype train like a Tanker CEO.  I don't know what you're doing Huya but in America we hype that shit. \n\n[Corporate Intrigue Baby](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/huya-inc-announces-changes-to-board-composition-301060713.html) Huya apparently announced a new board member. The DD I got is he is an acquisitions dude.  HMMMMMM \n\nMakes me think somethings shaking for Q2.  They say buy the rumor sell the news.\n\nWell I didn't get any news today.  All we learned was HUYA prints fucking money and keeps growing. \n\nI already knew that shit.\n\nI am however getting a lot of rumors.  Computers doing shady shit, Chinamen who ain't talking about the fucking killer app of the century, Vanessa Pink wants me.  If you are supposed to buy rumors and sell the news all I know is I've got more rumors than I have news.\n\nYOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?\n\nBUY FUCKING HUYA.  I sure as shit know that if someone is trying to do things to make me sell I must have something valuable.\n\nLet's see what happens tomorrow boys.
