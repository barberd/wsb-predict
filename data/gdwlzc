Even in March I wasn't as pessimistic as today - I assumed the worse will be either sensible lockdown until it's over, or half a million dead.\n\nSeems like the direction is getting both at the same time, and then probably getting stuck in a swedish deadlock: Sweden didn't reach herd immunity, they didn't lockdown but there's no public trust in going out so they are stuck at constant infection rate at the equilibrium between public fear and virus spread.\n\n[https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/sweden/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/sweden/)\n\nSweden can't say they are reopening to ease up economic burden because there is nothing to reopen. Reopening is just a rug pull to the poor - from now on, you're on your own economically.\n\nEDIT: I don't hold any puts / bear positions.
