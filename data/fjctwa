Please do what you want. Even ban me I don't care. Just make this sub great again.\n\nAlso, because I don't want to be part of the problem, here's some DD. Short UUP as a hedge for your other positions. If fed starts printing a shit ton of money and the market somehow survives this shit, well, your losses will be offset by this etf. UUP goes downies when fed prints lots of money. IV on it is low so premiums are resonable. But it won't go downies if everyone else prints money too, so keep that in mind.\n\nPositions: 18p Sept. \n\nTl;Dr: mods help, puts on UUP.", "created_utc": 1584322904.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjctwa/mods_were_so_sorry_please_come_back_some_currency/", "is_self": true}
