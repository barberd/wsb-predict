{"id": "g09e17", "title": "HTHT: The Next LK?", "selftext": "Disclaimer: Do not dump your entire portfolio on this play.\n\nTLDR: Buy HTHT puts.\n\nThis is a compilation of information regarding the possible fraudulent activities being conducted by Huazhu Group Limited (HTHT).\n\nWhat initially caught our attention to HTHT was the precise and suddenly routine put orders coming in on [04/06/20.](https://imgur.com/gallery/ydXXcVv)\n\nGenerally not super eye catching but the money kept flowing in for those same strikes and expirations, through [04/07/20.](https://imgur.com/gallery/Ia6F4p1)\n\nThe flow application keeps picking up HTHT puts, and barely any calls. This is highly suspicious. We saw similar flow activity with LK puts before the news dropped regarding LK's COO committing fraud and being suspended, and dropping LK stock price by nearly 75%.\n\nFace value it looked like it could possibly be a hedge for shares, but upon further investigation we came across a mountain of information regarding Panamanian shell companies, 150,000 UK businesses evading taxes and sanctions, Germany\u2019s second largest bank laundering money, connections to HSBC, and a tie right back to HTHT.\n\nTo start off, we began looking into the HTHT prospectus. This led us to the [principal shareholders list.](https://imgur.com/gallery/J6vvdhV)\n\nThe individuals first listed are the upper management for HTHT, like Qi Ji, the founder of Huazhu. Following shortly after that we have Winner Crown Holdings Limited which owns 41.97% of the companies shares. This quickly caught our attention and led us to an article written by the ICIJ (The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists), on [Winner Crown Holdings](https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/10113534) and Mossack Fonseca. Come to find out, Fonseca owned a company called Mossack Fonseca Company and had been using the firm as a shell company, to create shell companies in Panama.\n\nThis takes us to the Panama Papers. An insider anonymously passed terabytes of information to the ICIJ regarding Fonseca and his companies. The firm was committing tax fraud and tax evasion for 300,000+ businesses. They also officially owned 123 shell companies along side an associate of the former president of Argentina. That same year, In 2015 Fonseca was implicated for German money laundering and tax evasion for Commerzbank (the second largest bank in Germany). Fonseca didn\u2019t stop there. He went on to launder money, evade taxes/sanctions for some huge names. Initial reports identified five then-heads of state or government leaders from Argentina, Iceland, Saudi Arabia, Ukraine, and the United Arab Emirates as well as government officials, close relatives, and close associates of various heads of government of more than forty other countries. Names of then-current national leaders in the documents include President Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the United Arab Emirates, Petro Poroshenko of Ukraine, King Salman of Saudi Arabia, the brother of President Xi, and the Prime Minister of Iceland, Sigmundur Dav\u00ed\u00f0 Gunnlaugsson. Fonseca also smuggled oil for Bashir Al Assad, the president of Syria to avoid US sanctions.\n\nHTHT is registered in the Cayman Islands to avoid Chinese business taxes, which is where Fonseca and its' company comes into play. [Winner Crown has been doing business with HTHT since the early 2000\u2019s.](https://google.brand.edgar-online.com/efxapi/EFX_dll/EDGARpro.dll?FetchFilingHtmlSection1?SectionID=7148674-537039-545389&SessionID=Lpf2evEvZgUQ847)\n\nDetailed in the previous link, you\u2019ll see that every year since 2007, Huazhu has donated around $10,000,000 worth of shares to Winner Crown Holdings. It is through this that we came to the conclusion that Huazhu (HTHT) is using Winner Crown Holdings to launder money from Huazhu, Suzhou Property Company, Ctrip.com and Powerhill. It\u2019s also important to note that these companies are all owned by Qi Ji.\n\nAlong with fraudulent activities, Huazhu Group also dealt with leaks in 2018. [Chinese police investigated a possible leak of client information from Huazhu Group, after state media said nearly 500 million pieces of customer-related information from the hotel operator had emerged in an online post.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-huazhu-group/china-police-investigate-possible-data-breach-at-hotel-operator-huazhu-idUSKCN1LE0FW) \n\nRecessions bring out the bad in people, but they bring out the worst in businesses. Fraudulent activity hasn\u2019t bode too well for Chinese businesses in the last few weeks, with LK COO committing fraud and receiving a suspension to TAL issuing false statements and failing to disclose important information to their investors. This information shaking out could explain the massive flow of puts in recent weeks Will HTHT be the next Chinese company to have its' head on the chopping block?\n\nThe flow and all of this information was compiled by a few members of a trading group. I want to give all of them a shout out for their help with this research and the [LK play](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fu8eqg/this_1_lk_put_cost_me_around_20/?ref=share&ref_source=link) that returned a [5,518%](https://i.imgur.com/LEt5TuP.jpg) profit.", "created_utc": 1586742536.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g09e17/htht_the_next_lk/", "is_self": true}
