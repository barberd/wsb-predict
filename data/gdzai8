{"id": "gdzai8", "title": "DIS & BYND (Earnings)", "selftext": "DIS - Lost most of their revenue stream due to closing of parks within the last few months. Disney+ is a lifeline boat but they aren't coming up with new shows anytime soon as Hollywood A-Listers are too chickened out to start filming. They aren't making money of sports because there is no crowd in the fucking stadium and all the Marvel movies got pushed off for 2021-2022\n\nDIS PUTS (5/15)\n\nBYND - 2x price meat compared to average Joe meat. Plus, with 30mil+ people filing for unemployment, their sales are slagging. To bring up the profit margins, they need improvement in their supply chain and reduce manufacturing costs which I'm sure they will over time (they haven't yet). They did really well last quarter yet after earnings, the stock dropped. I'm sure they didn't do better than the last quarter. \n\nBYND PUTS (5/15) \n\n(I have long-term positions on both of these companies, it's an earnings play.)", "created_utc": 1588690813.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gdzai8/dis_bynd_earnings/", "is_self": true}
