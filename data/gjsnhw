Hope you bought those sweet 5/15   \n 25 calls.  \n\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g90rza/draftkings\\_vs\\_fanduel/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g90rza/draftkings_vs_fanduel/)  \n\n\nGonna keep this short and sweet.   \n\n\nUsed to be a pretty serious daily fantasy player. I expected Draftkings daily fantasy business to drop off a cliff. That did not happen. Check their lobby. They are hosting big Korean Baseball tournaments every day. Additionally mma and nascar seem much bigger than they normally did. We know how much meme stocks go up when there's no earnings, (spce). Think about how much they'll go up when they actually HAVE earnings.   \n\n\nLong term it remains overvalued, PDYPDY shares, DK calls. Long term puts.  \n\n\n5/15 30 call. Wait till it explodes up past 35, get a long term put.  \n\n\n\\- Stonkenator", "created_utc": 1589482870.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gjsnhw/dkng_will_beat_earnings/", "is_self": true}
