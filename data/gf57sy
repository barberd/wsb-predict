DKNG is this shiny new object and we\u2019ve all had it downloaded on our phones for years, ever since they and FanDuel paid a quadrillion dollars in advertising to put commercials on every television channel in every commercial break. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing though, what limited financial information we have for DKNG doesn\u2019t support the valuation it is already at. Yes, it\u2019s obviously growing, and yes, in theory more states will legalize gambling, but this is the case for every company in the industry.\n\nDKNG only had $323M in **revenue** last year. Revenue. It had a net loss of $142M for the year.\n\nBut forget the loss, an expanding company is allowed to lose money as long as the long term prospects are good. It\u2019s that revenue number that should concern you.\n\nDKNG currently has a market cap of nearly $17B, with a \u201cB\u201d. The company\u2019s revenue is in the $300M\u2019s, but it\u2019s market cap is creeping towards $20B\n\nDKNG currently has a market cap 2.5 times higher than MGM which is down below $7B. \n\nMGM had $13B in revenue in 2019, **40 times more than DKNG**. Their net income was over $2B.\n\nTLDR: No positions, but if you\u2019re putting money into DKNG, then you better be putting even more into the much more successful and established gambling/casinos names that are way below their ATH", "created_utc": 1588852938.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gf57sy/the_obsession_with_dkng_has_gone_too_far/", "is_self": true}
