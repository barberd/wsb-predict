It didn\u2019t work out\n\nFYI, I didn\u2019t do the research just so I can inverse it at the end. That would have defeated the whole purpose of fooling the fate by already having some prebuilt bias. \n\nI genuinely did the research and thought I can win the fate by hard work and dedication. The inverse at the end was a last minute autistic impulse. So it is a legit attempt to fool the fate\n\n \n\nNext trick I am gonna try\n\nI am gonna blindfold myself and pick 5 random tickers from RH 100 most popular stocks, random strike price, random date , calls/puts and see if that can break my luck\n\n( I am still an amateur retard. Still didn\u2019t go full retard so far, as to put all my money. \nWill use my room mates help to make sure I buy only one contract and cost basis less than <100$ each)\n\n\n\nCurrently holding 2 SPY 5/1 305 call", "created_utc": 1587585313.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6847j/100_wrong_prediction/", "is_self": true}
