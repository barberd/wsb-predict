{"id": "grcltq", "title": "How to Buy SpaceX Shares or Any Other Pre-IPO Stock", "selftext": "I see people constantly wanting in on the Elon Musk cult of companies. Mainly SpaceX, due to large potential growth, and cult following. A lot of people think you can not buy shares in SpaceX (Company I will focus on) But you can, and you can also buy other Pre-IPO shares of hundreds of companies, do this at your own risk.\n\nFirst: Have a lot of money, stop right here if you don't make 200k individually or 1 million in net worth excluding primary residence. Sorry your SOL, make some tendies then come back.\n\nSecond How to buy these shares: It's unlikely that you can go directly to companies unless you got a private broker and are really rich. But luckily some smart people realized that somewhat rich folk want in. I will talk about EquityZen and Forge Global. Both of these sites offer funds and allow direct share purchases. Keep in mind they are minimums, often 10-20k in total purchases as well 3-5% fee of the total transaction.*edit from a fellow user SpaceX is 250k minimum \n\nThird: How it works, you get access to the roughly current share price, you submit an offer. If you want direct shares, they will try and find sellers, often employees who don't want to hold a large amount of $$$ in their company. They then say we found a buyer, you pay up, they handle all the paperwork for you. And after all the fees you now are a shareholder! For SpaceX with having endless rounds of funding, the shares are pretty liquid. And if they ever IPO you will be a rich man. Please check out their FAQ, and do your DD before doing anything stupid.\n\nFourth: Relating to SpaceX they are probably my 1#, they just inked an army deal for StarLink, and are by far the best positioned for Space Transport cost. Could be a trillionaire dollar company if StarLink does as promised. Not even mixing in a Mars colony. But also, the value is at the whim of Elon, if he dies or something happens you are screwed. To quote one engineer, \u201c Elon tells us what to make\u201d.\n\nTLDR: Have 1 million dollars or 200k in income. Make an account with EquityZen or Forge Global, submit an offer, buy shares. This is not financial advice, contact your tax person to make sure you meet all requirements and potential tax bills.\n\nLinks:\nIRS Rules:\n\nhttps://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-bulletins/updated-3\n\nhttps://equityzen.com/company/spacex/\n\n\nhttps://forgeglobal.com/company/space-exploration-technologies", "created_utc": 1590552950.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/grcltq/how_to_buy_spacex_shares_or_any_other_preipo_stock/", "is_self": true}
