{"id": "gtq84h", "title": "Cascading systematic failures are occurring", "selftext": "There are at least five negative trends in the US that are mutually feeding off each other: mass civil unrest, coronavirus, unemployment, reduced consumer spending, and reduced government responsiveness. \n\nIt should be clear how those five trends exacerbate each other, but here's a few examples for the morons: Unemployed people lose faith in the system and are more likely to protest. People get infected at protests. Riots drive away jobs. Fewer jobs means reduced government revenue. Poorer governments react worse to outbreaks and protests, and hire fewer public employees, ect. ect. Added to these trends are the presence of radicals who think that right now is the best chance they'll get to bring upon a workers revolution or the Boogaloo or a race war or whatever. They will actively try to increase internal social and political tensions.\n\nAtlanta Fed projects a roughly 12% GDP contraction in Q2. That's not the annualized rate - that's the total projected contraction in 90 days. The annualized rate is negative 51%. Hear that sound? That's the sound of your economy shrinking by one percent every week. This is unprecedented for any major economy in global history.\n\nThe collapsing economy, pandemic, mass civil unrest, and failed government response are feeding off each other. Normalcy bias makes it hard for people to imagine that systems can radically change, but they can, and sometimes very quickly. Even if somehow the US can quickly get a handle on these challenges before they get out of control, major turbulence is almost unavoidable. Uncertainty and reduced revenue should lead to a major correction in asset prices, unless there is serious monetary inflation.\n\nTLDR: we're probably fucked.
