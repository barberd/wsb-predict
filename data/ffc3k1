{"id": "ffc3k1", "title": "Let an oldster tell you what it was like dealing with a REAL challenge - the financial crisis.", "selftext": "You think some Chinese germs are a tough problem to solve?\n\nBack in 2008, we had an actual issue on our hands - people wrote down numbers that were too high on their mortgage paperwork! Which, of course, caused bankers to immediately stop what they were doing and refuse to work. Those numbers were too high! They shouldn't be that high. What was going on??? \n\nFortunately, our noble leaders got together and decided on a course of action. It took months of hard work, but they finally slogged through it and decided to... give banks a bunch of money. But, the money they gave at first wasn't enough to counter the numbers that were too high! They needed more money! But those fearless lads buckled down and wrote numbers just as high as the other numbers and so it all worked out.\n\nAfter the smoke cleared from the horrible, no good, very bad big number crisis, the stock market had declined 50% and unemployment went up 100%. But everything was totally fine and there was no social unrest and we didn't need to continually stimulate the economy for the next 5 years just to keep it from buckling again.\n\nVersus today, what are you kids facing? A \"pandemic\"? Lol, all you guys have to do is watch 2% of the population die. Like, what is that? They won't see their stonks go down, they'll be dead! Big whoop. Plus, all the government has to do is coordinate policy on both a national and international level! Making sure not only are people working on a cure, but also manufacturing and distributing it, keeping it from spreading quickly, keeping people from travelling, and quelling panic. Ez-peazy. Oh and also to keep banks liquidated like before!\n\nWhen it's all over, I doubt you'll even remember it happened, unlike us, who had to deal with smelly hippies camping outside wall street for a couple months. Some days I didn't know how we'd make it! I'd suggest you pull up your socks and get to it, you kids.", "created_utc": 1583671741.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffc3k1/let_an_oldster_tell_you_what_it_was_like_dealing/", "is_self": true}
