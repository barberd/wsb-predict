At \\~13bn DKNG seems reasonable relative to large market opportunity.\n* Above fwd multiples seem fair relative to where 80 or so of the best performers trade at these days; 3M Impl. Vol for a company of that size looks fair at \\~104.\n\nDownside \u2014 What can go wrong?\n\n* A lot of things, lots of price risk given recent IPO, it\u2019s a popular speculative trade with lots of short-term traders in and out. Worth noting also a handful on important catalysts ahead (more states, user growth, )\n* Expect wild moves, however, there are very strong tailwinds behind this one in an infant market\n* In light of market fundamentals, relative risk premium, and competitive position, I am a strong bull on this one.", "created_utc": 1591902579.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h15ry5/my_thoughts_self_qa_on_dkng/", "is_self": true}
