I have (barely) above average experience with data analytics AND machine learning. How should I put this to use to make tendies?\n\nJoking aside, I'm sure that people much smarter, richer, and more experienced than myself do this daily for a living. I'm still thinking it might be possible to make a small profit off general swing trading with my very basic knowledge. There outline of my idea is to write a program to predict changes between one days open and the next, but I'm slowly refining it. Any ideas/recommendations what indicators I should use, tickers to follow, or other approaches to making the best predictor? Also, any ideas where to get data dumps in large spreadsheet styles?", "created_utc": 1561905121, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c7euuf/applications_for_machine_learning_in_swing_trading/", "is_self": true}
