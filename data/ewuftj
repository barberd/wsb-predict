At worse I lose 5000$ at best I make infinite amount of tendies, literally can\u2019t go tits up.\n\nI\u2019m thinking Apple could easily hit 500$ if 5G roll-out and services/wearables do well in 2020 which is apple is very on track to do. So I\u2019m wonder why would anyone not get apple leap calls for discount during this fake flu BS?", "created_utc": 1580502675, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ewuftj/any_reason_why_i_shouldnt_buy_aapl_leap_calls_for/", "is_self": true}
