{"id": "cqrguh", "title": "Straight forward trading Strategy.", "selftext": "I\u2019ve been enlightened. Since discovering this shit thread and options, I\u2019ve lost roughly $2,500 (in 5 months). That\u2019s not much for some, but it could have paid off the rest of my car loan. Instead I pissed it away on stupid OTM ER option plays that didn\u2019t work out 90% of the time. I\u2019m an actual idiot, I know. \n\nI did some soul searching and I think I\u2019m going to make the transitions back to regular investing, but the investments will only be in companies that made products that I use. I am going to still dabble in options except I won\u2019t buy FD\u2019s on Tsla 420. \n\nHere is my shit DD on 3 stocks I plan on buying AND holding. \n\nChewy (CHWY): I recently got a puppy, and chewy has been an amazing company. Their products are top tier, they customer service is comparable to chick-fil-a. I mean it\u2019s fucking top notch. Their delivery speed is incredible and the prices are as low as you can find. If you know millennials, you\u2019ll know that they spare no expense on pet stuff. LONG CHWY!\n\nKohl\u2019s (KSS): I know what you\u2019re thinking.. \u201cWho the fuck invests in brick and mortar stores?? Are you stupid!\u201d.  Well, I shop at kohl\u2019s regularly, their prices are reasonable as shit, their kohl\u2019s cash is basically free money to use on more dumb shit to buy there. I bought my first suit there for $100 and tailored it for another $50. It\u2019s my favorite suit and I got my first big boy job wearing it. It\u2019s surprisingly super nice and to the untrained eye, people couldn\u2019t even tell that I spent pennies on the suit. Also, middle class families (moms) spend hundreds on clothes for their kids. The clothing is affordable and pretty good in terms of quality. Moms love that place. Finally Amazon partnered with kohl\u2019s in terms of that kohl\u2019s accepts amazon returns and will ship it back for you. This partnership is just the beginning of a strong relationship with amazon. What if there was a possibility of a buy out in the next decade?! \n\nMicrosoft (MSFT): Microsoft rules the computer space. They\u2019re constantly evolving and improving. I mean shit, who doesn\u2019t have windows on their PC/laptop. They\u2019re sitting on a shitload of cash, they\u2019re never fucking their investors and I just like them. \n\nOk so there\u2019s my 3 picks for going long and strong. \n\nIf I were to go back to options, I\u2019m going to do leaps on these stocks. \n\nI look forward to seeing more stupid FD gains and losses on this sub!", "created_utc": 1565883378, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cqrguh/straight_forward_trading_strategy/", "is_self": true}
