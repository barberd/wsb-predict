{"id": "g4u4mb", "title": "Small Businesses, A Stimulus, IWM, and Your Wife. An Epic Saga of Three Things Failing and One Thing Leaving You.", "selftext": "Should Your IWM Puts be Scared of The Next Stimulus?\n\n**TL;DR- No**. There you go... Leave an upvote and comment thanking me for my service or read the post that I spent an hour or more making fun and exciting, unlike your love life. ***Also, a slightly more in depth TL;DR is at the bottom.***\n\nRecently, you may have heard that the ever slippery Stevey Mnuch and Friends want to inject an additional 370 billion to the small business loan program. You may have sat at your computer typing on those keys that have had an odd crusty white substance stuck them since March 23rd. You mag be shaking in your Fruit of the Loom tighty whites *(Not a recommendation to buy $HBI)* while you scream, \"Oh no... My 80 4/24 IWM Put won't print now!\" First off, if you're that stupid and have that position please give me evidence so I can give you some gold awards. **Secondly, this stimulus bill will be about as useful as you in the bedroom when your wife's boyfriend is over.** Allow me to explain.\n\n\n--------\n**Reason One:**\n\nIt's simply not enough money. In the [original bullshit](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-anatomy-of-the-2-trillion-covid-19-stimulus-bill/) Papa Pump Trump slid into the economy's backdoor it contained $377 Billion for Small Businesses. *-349 of which was paycheck protection, this will be important later-* Now as you read I want you to keep in mind that I'm not talking about the hog local florist from whom you buy your wife flowers in hopes that he legs will bloom open for you. **Remember, she is traded around by the Chads in your hometown, not the NYSE.** Only a small portion (17B) of this money was set aside for existing loan relief and an even smaller portion (10B) in grants. \n\nMany of these small-mid cap companies that IWM tracks **already have** existing loans and outlying credit. If you don't know how to read a balance sheet I highly reccomend enrolling in your local community college. Not only will you learn about finance from a rapidly deteriorating old man, but maybe the weird goth girl might get hot and heavy with you when she sees that **bloody** looking robinhood portfolio of yours. Now I'm not talking about Boeing ($BA) level debt where selling your firstborn to help with the debt is a requirement for each employee upon hiring, but the average small business had $195,000 in debt [as of 2016](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/smallbusiness/2017/05/15/5-steps-digging-out-business-debt/101424796/) so you can use some mental math to leg that up to your mid caps. So... If that preemptive 377 billion disappeared in right around two weeks, *-Arguably faster as we weren't alerted to this until the website told us so-* explain to me how the tits 370 billion will help when we have even more needy companies? \n\n--------\n**Reason Two:**\n\nThe loan is getting chopped up and tossed around like your dog Rufus in a Wuhan Wet Market. To quote the devil named CNBC \"Democrats and Republicans were negotiating a deal that would allocate $310 billion more into the Paycheck Protection Program, set aside $60 billion of that sum for rural and minority groups. Another $60 billion would go to the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program.\" So there is your first few cuts. Not only would they be once again screwing companies by only allowing them to allocate money to paychecks, but not we're getting PC and making sure Cotton Eye Joe and Minorities get their fair share. Please keep in mind this portion is discussing the 310 billion portion for paycheck protection... Just imagine the Xtra small condoms you use, but for paychecks. \n\n\nLet's do some Mad Money Math in honor of Cramer:\n370-310= 60 Billion for actual Business Expenses. \n310-60-60=*69* + 121-60 = **130 Billion** For people who don't find pleasure *erotically* touching cows and non-minorities. We're also subtracting that 3rd 60 million because it's just a specialized loan for the really small companies. (Irrelevant and I'll subtract in the end)\n\n\nSo, now that we've figured out that we've got 130 billion for all buisne-**\"Earlier in the day, Mnuchin said the deal could include $75 billion in funding for hospitals and $25 billion in funding for testing.\"** Okay, shit. 130-100=**30 Billion** open for regular businesses. We also [already have](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/17/jpmorgan-says-it-has-26-billion-in-small-business-applications-left.html) 26 billion dollars worth of loans just waiting to be filled at JPM alone. As the late Billy Mays used to say *But wait! Theres more!*\n\n\nAlright, so maybe they're going to tack that onto the bill and just make it 470, right? Right? Probably not. Based on consensus explained by Ronald McDonald... *Looks at notes written in crayon* I mean Mitch McConnell, the current state of the bill is pretty much accepted by both parties. This means these cuts are once again coming from inside the fund and are just being reallocated and limited once again. Right now they're just arguing about whether of not they should short $SNAP, err, I mean ensure those small businesses without bank relationships get those SNAP benefits. They're like you... **Having Relations = Bad. Watching Your Wife Have Relations = Good**\n\n\n--------\n**Reason Three:**\n\n\nThe makeup of IWM is nothing like SPY and contains businesses with **huge** weaknesses. [SPY](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/122215/spy-spdr-sp-500-trust-etf.asp) has large holding in the the markets daddies like GOOGL, AMZN, BERK.B, MSFT, AAPL, etc. These companies are nothing but resilient. Hell, it took Apple a [month](https://www.apple.com/iphone-se/) to produce a cheap Corona phone. These guys are at the top of their game, meanwhile [IWM](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239710/ishares-russell-2000-etf) contains huge amounts of Real Estate, Financials, Industrials, and most importantly... Healthcare.\n\n\n*\"bUT i_nOT HEalThCArE cAn OnLY gO UpSieS\"* \n\n\nListen here you idiots, I'm going to give you a little background on myself :) I wear many panties, but one of my biggest and most comfortable pairs is the management and QC of a number pharmaceutical warehouses. I can anecdotally tell you that pharmaceuticals are going in and out faster than the speed of light. Kind of like how you'll forget everything you just read in two hours, so don't forget to reread this seven times... I think that is a psychological fact? So yes, things are moving fast and healthcare is sort of working but here is the most important thing, we're not really getting shipments from outside the US. The \"legal drug trade\" inside the US is shipping at an all time high right now, but we're only passing around **what we already have**. Outside drugs are coming in at a steady rate but they're being used up so quickly by the big boys little pharma has no chance. Why is that important? Well, that means little pharma has no opportunity to get their gloves on the supplies/drugs needed for testing and 'cures'. *Checks notes* Ah, guess I should help you remember that relatively small healthcare companies make up 22% of IWM's positions and all of that 100 billion is going into **testing** and **hospitals**. Also, the next biggest position is in Financials... Do I really need to explain why that is awesome for your puts? \n\n\n-------- \n\nTL;DR\nThe Wrap Up: *What your wife's boyfriend doesn't do-*\n\n\nSo here is what we just discussed in a nutshell. The Fed is giving 370 billion to 'small businesses'. 310 billion of that goes to paycheck assurance. 120 million of that 310 is reserved for minorities and farmers. 60 Billion is reserved for tiny companies and pyramid schemes on Instagram. Another 25 billion of that is for testing and 75 billion more is for hospitals. So... All in all actual small-mid cap businesses who need money have little to no chance to get it. The balance sheets of these companies won't improve anytime soon and the disruption will last for many more months. IWM's makeup is nothing like SPY, and it features companies that will fail. IWM will fall, it was relatively resilient during the initial fall and it will see new lows. Albeit, I'm just some dummy on Reddit who makes occasional DD and Memes. \n\nLove,\n\nI_Not", "created_utc": 1587394096.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4u4mb/small_businesses_a_stimulus_iwm_and_your_wife_an/", "is_self": true}
