Not in this group. \u201dMaking millions over 4 years isn\u2019t what this forum is about, 1 week or nothing,\u201d Paradox501 wrote.\n\nMost, however, prodded him for some tips and insight, and he was happy to oblige, answering dozens of questions as his post continued to attract attention.\n\nSo what\u2019s his secret?\n\n\u201cResearch and then following my gut. I think the thing I\u2019ve been most successful with is not cutting off winners that will double when I\u2019m up 10%,\u201d he wrote of his investing method. \u201cLimit number of positions. Don\u2019t chase/revenge/FOMO trade. Buy the dip. Nearly every lesson you think you\u2019ve learned will be the wrong lesson to apply at some point in the future.\u201d\n\nHe said that he usually focuses on a single position, sometimes as much as 90% of his portfolio will be concentrated on his conviction pick. At the moment, he\u2019s \u201cthe most diversified\u201d he\u2019s ever been, with his portfolio split between AMD [**AMD,** **-3.99%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/AMD?mod=MW_story_quote) and Norwegian Cruise Line [**NCLH,** **4.52%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/NCLH?mod=MW_story_quote).  \n\n\n \u201cThey have 18 months of liquidity. If cruises aren\u2019t back by then there are a WHOLE lot of other businesses that will be going under in the meantime,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m planning to hold until at least 40 and think it could be a year to a year and a half. Other cruise/travel stocks probably good too but NCLH is my favorite. I\u2019m considering moving some more from AMD over in the next couple months.\u201d\n\nIf Norwegian hits his target, IKnowTheCodings said he will consider hanging it up. \u201cI like my job \\[as a web developer\\],\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d probably be more tempted at 4M.\u201d\n\nAssuming his trading tale is true \u2014 he didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment \u2014 his push toward an early retirement took a baby step forward in Wednesday\u2019s session, as shares of Norwegian rallied almost 5% amid a broader market advance.", "created_utc": 1590599294.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/grnpl0/investor_turns_100000_into_22_million_now_hes/", "is_self": true}
