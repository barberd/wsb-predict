{"id": "gh68bo", "title": "The Mickey Trade", "selftext": "I follow big & unusual options activity in the market & make trades when I see big money hit a name combined with a nice technical setup. When big money hits the options market it is often the smart money that knows something we tards dont, so I try to follow those moves. There was a number of stonks on Friday (and last week) that were seeing high unusual options activity - see https://www.barchart.com/options/volume-leaders/stocks?page=1 for end of day data.\n\nOf many options that stood out to me (many of which I got into as well), $DIS call buying really stood out to me for a couple reasons. \n\n1. Technical setup is beautiful. DIS held $100 after poor ER & is now pushing higher on positive reopening news. There is a gap that will lead us to $120 if we can break out past $113. \n2. On Friday alone the May15 $110s & $112s were traded in high volume. The $110s traded 16k to oi of 20k and the $112s traded nearly 20k compared to an oi of just over 1k. When volume exceed oi like this it is a clear sign big traders are moving in. The $112s represent a trade of over $1M on OTM <30delta that expires in a week.\n3. While the two prior points are really what I look for to execute a trade it is worth mentioning that laggards are beginning to come up, and leisure related stocks are rallying big time, DIS included. If this money flow/trade continues next week these calls will do nicely. \n\nI have 40 $112s @ .8 & looking to add more Monday if it doesn't open up - not a huge trade right now but looking to double or triple up if I get the entry. If you can't control your tism & want more unusual activity trades check out these (all calls).\n\nJD May15 $45, June19 $41, $45, $47, July $47\n\nTWTR May15 $30, May29 $33 & $35\n\nLVS (similar momentum trade as DIS) May15 $53, June $50 $55 $60\n\nCCL May22 $15 & $17\n\nDDOG May15 $60\n\nATVI May15 $74\n\nSDC May15 $7 $8.50 $9, June19 $10 & $13\n\nMU May15 $48.50 & $50\n\nON May15 $17\n\nWORK May15 $32\n\nTLRY May15 $8\n\nSNAP May15 $18.50\n\nTldr: A couple million dollars has gone into OTM DIS calls expiry Friday & I am following the big money. Long DIS May15 $110, $112.\n\nE: Formatting", "created_utc": 1589133858.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gh68bo/the_mickey_trade/", "is_self": true}
