Remember IV can be your friend just as fast as it's your enemy.\n \n2  Second, Tech AND tech equipment stocks are booming because everything is online currently.\nExplanation: Gold rush analogy.\nIn the trade of selling the picks, shovels and axes to the gold miners only 2-3% of them make it big after hacking away at the mountain, while the guys selling the tools make a ton of money. They sell the equipment to actually use their platforms. So basically whenever someone bought something online there was a device they had to buy first to gain access to the sites.\n\n3  Third, you can play the runup or actually play the earnings.(Imo both \nshould be good for stock price)\nExplanation: Anticipation  \n            If you're skeptical of holding through earnings just sell before and play IV and runup\n            The only reason I don't see them having a runup is if the entire market crashes but we         likely won't see that till August-November.\n \nLinks to Bullish signals on $Dell\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/tech-stocks-are-getting-pricey-here-are-12-stocks-still-worth-buyingand-1-to-short-51588972462?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo\n\n\u201cHP Inc.
