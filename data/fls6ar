I think it\u2019s very important we keep in mind the circumstances and don\u2019t get fomo. The smart thing to do it wait until the rally is over, and go heavy on puts as it starts to weaken again. We\u2019ll see another leg down likely about the same amount as this first drop. The first day with Heavy volume to the downside is a great sign of this. I will be buying puts then. For now I\u2019m just going to watch though and hold my ZM stock.", "created_utc": 1584696663.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fls6ar/advice_for_next_week/", "is_self": true}
