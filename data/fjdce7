I was out of the country on vacation last week and my phone was wonky with times, even though I was in the same time zone.  Friday mid day I bought some TWTR 29 weekly calls.  I only bought 10 at 3 cents each, (high roller, right?) then sold 5 for 10 cents to let the rest ride.  My phone showed 3 afterall.  Turns out, that 3 was actually 4, market closed and I had 5 calls in the money.  I wondered how they would settle, but they assigned me the shares - 500 at $29.   I don't have the cash to cover, and am transferring enough to cover the margin call.   But with the futures down is there any way to mitigate at this point?  Or I just need to eat the loss pre market?", "created_utc": 1584325084.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjdce7/accidentally_assigned_twtr_shares_what_to_do/", "is_self": true}
