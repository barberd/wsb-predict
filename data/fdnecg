I had $4082.\n\nInstead of $ROPE, I posted the [CCL DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f94hy6/the_case_for_ccl_puts/) and instead of being a retard, put it in a cheap but long-expiration 35% OTM CCL $25p July.\n\n[https://imgur.com/Nmg8DJr](https://imgur.com/Nmg8DJr)\n\n[https://imgur.com/d8YH7IL](https://imgur.com/d8YH7IL)\n\n\\^ That's nice, back to $25k while everyone was still calling  \ud83c\udf08   \ud83d\udc3b\n\nSo, riding a few bear waves (mostly CCL since they were still cheap last week), I managed to bring myself up to $45k or so. I bought GLD the morning before the 2nd RH hiccup on my way to work (yesterday), and didn't expect the Fed to cut rates\n\n[https://imgur.com/E3EEPPh](https://imgur.com/E3EEPPh)\n\n\\^That's great, I can afford a house now after the   \ud83d\udc36   wife took the last one\n\nBought QQQ calls, almost lost half, but came back to BE today. Should have held it through the power hour... would have $104k right now.\n\nCurrently sitting on $84k and [selling some MSFT $150p June](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fdnlp8/the_case_for_selling_puts_msft_150p_june/) to capture some of that IV decay. \n\nMy 1 month\n\n[https://imgur.com/gxnBzQo](https://imgur.com/gxnBzQo)\n\nMy all\n\n[https://imgur.com/I4iCkDK](https://imgur.com/I4iCkDK)\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1583371109.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fdnecg/a_20bag_in_8_trading_days_4k_to_84k/", "is_self": true}
