While the markets were closed this weekend, I did a little bit of research into spreads. This sounds like an outstanding way to lose money and I am waiting in anticipation for opening bell. \n\nUnfortunately, TD only allows me to purchase naked calls. I have attempted to apply for spreads several times, but have always been denied. I even tried setting my net worth to 1 million and my options experience to 10+ years. As a last ditch effort, I changed my options education level to \"professional trader\". Still no dice. \n\nWSB, how can I convince TD to allow me to buy spreads? Alternatively, is there another less restrictive broker that you recommend?", "created_utc": 1575857475, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e83cnx/authorization_to_purchase_spreads_on_td/", "is_self": true}
