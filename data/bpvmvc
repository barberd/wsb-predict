{"id": "bpvmvc", "title": "Lowkey I have some interesting info on TD Bank", "selftext": "So TD bank recently sent out a letter to all customers about a month ago. Apparently tons of people have been using their own money to gamble and bet and as a result the bank felt the need to send everyone a letter. I\u2019m going to guess they have been hemorrhaging money from boomers buying what the letter describes as horse race tickets. Could this be an indicator of a solid put? If needed I can maybe provide the letter if I can find it under my pile of McDonald\u2019s recipes.", "created_utc": 1558121550, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bpvmvc/lowkey_i_have_some_interesting_info_on_td_bank/", "is_self": true}
