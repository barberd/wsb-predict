They dropped 33+% on their last earnings report after they sandbagged on their guidance and then dropped another 10% after a downgrade from MS this week based on weak results from others in the sector. They usually beat on estimates, but estimates are projecting a YoY decline so even a beat might not be enough. It's oversold but not by a crazy amount (14-day RSI is 38) and trading near 52-week lows. \n\nOptions max pain for 5/31 exp is at ~$37.50, which would be an 11.3% increase. Looking at the [options chain](https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/ntnx/option-chain) there's almost nothing being traded that's in the money. So basically this is a play that is almost guaranteed to either go gangbusters or be a total loss.\n\nThe [YTD chart](https://i.imgur.com/ZVsZcUn.png) is something else, any of you autists playing their earnings tomorrow?", "created_utc": 1559195486, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bupjkc/anyone_else_excited_for_nutanix_ntnx_earnings/", "is_self": true}
