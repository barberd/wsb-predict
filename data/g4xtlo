VIX was around 41 when SPY was in the 270s last week/2 weeks ago... VIX is now around 41 when SPY is around 285 on downtrending volume. I know you can't TA the VIX, but VIX has been trending up over the past week, so doesn't that represent an increasingly fearful market?\n\nWhat's this mean?\n\nIf vix is at an equivalent value as it was when spy was lower from a couple weeks ago, that means puts are rising, and since volume is shrinking on the spy uptrend over the past weekish, then that only means institutions and MMs are loading the FUCK up right now and I am more confident than ever on a true leg down very soon.\n\nTldr VXX 52c/61c 6/19\n\nEdit: posted this at 2pm EST when vxx was at 40.6, now 3pm its 42+", "created_utc": 1587405748.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4xtlo/vix_is_indicating_a_spy_crash_soon/", "is_self": true}
