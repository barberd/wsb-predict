He thinks he can reopen the country by Easter. Here in Europe, we are about one week early from the US regarding the epidemic. Our government is saying this is gonna last and we aren't even at the peak of the epidemic.\n\nNow you're gonna say \"but you're pussies in Europe\". That statement is fully accurate, but what we aren't is arrogant (currently, lol), and in fact as Fauci said the virus makes the timeline, not us. Not to mention the lockdown measures are much more severely enforced in Europe and in the US (people are getting fined all the time by police) and we STILL haven't reached the peak. So imagine the shitshow it's gonna be in the US.\n\nYou cannot cheat with a biological reality. In France it was just announced that a 16 year-old healthy girl with no preexisting conditions has died from the virus.\n\nJay Pow pumping tens of trillions into the economy ain't gonna change the fact that this is a dire situation. I dunno what the market's been smoking but the rally in the past couple of days is just nuts.\n\nBoris Johnson has just been infected. Now just wait and see when Daddy Pump gets it and ends up in ICU: he's old and fat. This ain't over boys. The market is completely autistic.\n\nEdit: also, short GM https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1243557418556162050", "created_utc": 1585309272.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpvhbk/guys_donnie_pump_is_completely_nuts_a_french_guys/", "is_self": true}
