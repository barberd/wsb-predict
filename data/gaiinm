{"id": "gaiinm", "title": "(Serious) Addiction to Options", "selftext": "I know this not an average post but I'm wondering has anyone been addicted to Options trading before? I know this sounds autistic but it's become a problem for me and I'm sure for others. \n\nWhen I first starting trading 5 years ago, I was swing trading, day trading a little, and did some value investing (gay right). However, it was all fun. I genuinely enjoyed it, did my research and made some money. \n\nFast forward to now I've been balls deep in options. Losing tens of thousands and making tens of thousands. This time I feel addicted to it. I'm constantly checking my phone at work, hoping on ETrade multiple times an hour, even in market after-hours I'll be reading about companies . I beat myself up (not physically) over contracts I sold too early or bought too late. I've actually lost sleep over it. \n\nWhat has helped besides pulling out all together?", "created_utc": 1588196831.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gaiinm/serious_addiction_to_options/", "is_self": true}
