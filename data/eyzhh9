Honestly I don\u2019t know what the fuck I\u2019m doing but still I\u2019m on green. So anyways today on my Business Math class there was some guest speaking about the stocks. He was a JPMorgan Vice bond manager idk some shit like that. So in the end I asked a question: \u201cWhy do you think the tesla is rising at the moment so much, it has gone up 30 bucks since you started this speech. And i will never forget his answer. He said\n\n\u201cThe fundamentals are not there, I dont know what the Millennial idiots are doing and why the fuck they are buying this shit. (Yes he cursed). Then I answered\u201dnever underestimate the papa elon. \nHe agreed.\n\nSo in conclusion, that dude who made 4 milj with tesla calls. You are an idiot.", "created_utc": 1580859423, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eyzhh9/millennials_are_idiots/", "is_self": true}
