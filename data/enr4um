They had just lost their WV-4 satellite, and were accused of fraudulent accounting activity which hid massive debt. Share price tanked from $60 --&gt; $5 rather quickly. \n\nThen they hire a new CEO: Daniel Jablonski, a former Naval officer with tons of experience working with $MAXR clientele such as the DOD and IC.\n\nThis motherfucker has been ripping bears a new asshole for an entire year. Share price has went from $5.40 -&gt; $19.90 under his leadership. His top priority has been lowering their previously crippling debt load while keeping the essential assets.\n\nAs of SEP 2019, they have $3.2B in debt. Share price on SEP 30 was $7.60\n\nThey recently sold their Canadian asset (MDA) for $765MM and sold some Palo Alto real estate for $291MM. Over $1B of debt delevered in 2019. They still have $2B in debt. Now the share price is $19.90.\n\nMAXR is one of three companies bidding on a $3B contract with Telesat. Imagine if MAXR wins that shit (or gets any piece of it).\n\nAlso, MAXR is expected to launch their Worldview Legion satellite constellation in Q1 2021, which is expected to be a major asset. MAXR is 92/92 with successful satellite launches. \n\nI'm seeing great things for this company down the line. It's fundamentals are changing for the better. I say get some 2021/2022 calls, cause we never know how this is going to behave short term. Hell, the RSI is 84 right now, so it's probably due for a pullback soon. \n\nBut give it time, and you'll have your tendies.", "created_utc": 1578853518, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/enr4um/i_wanna_see_you_all_get_tendies_get_maxr_leaps/", "is_self": true}
