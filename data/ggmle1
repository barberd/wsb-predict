I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 11th, 2020.\n\n# **Stocks are expected to trade the economy\u2019s reopening in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/08/stocks-expected-to-trade-the-economys-reopening-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n> Investors will watch the economy\u2019s reopening progress, as well as a series of economic reports in the coming week that will provide a look at the consumer during April as the economy shed 20.5 million jobs.\n*****\n> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks on a webcast held by the Peterson Institute on Wednesday at 9 a.m., and he will be watched closely for any new insights on the economy or Fed programs.\n*****\n> There are just a few earnings releases ahead, but there will be a barrage of economic reports, including consumer and producer inflation, consumer sentiment and most importantly retail sales on Friday. \n*****\n> # Stocks versus bonds\n> Stocks were higher in the past week, even as some bond yields touched record lows. Yields move opposite price, and bonds usually move opposite stocks.\n*****\n> \u201cThe stock market is trading the reopening, and the bond market is doubting the vibrant pace of an economic recovery upon the reopening,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group.\n*****\n> Small cap stocks and tech led the way higher in the past week. The Nasdaq jumped 6% in a week, where it wiped out its losses for the year and turned positive. The small cap Russell 2000 was up 5.5%.\n*****\n> The S&P 500 was up 3.5% for the week to 2,929, with tech up 6.6% and consumer discretionary stocks up 4.4%.\n*****\n> The bond market and stock market have both responded to the Fed\u2019s programs that put more liquidity into the financial system, with bond rates falling and stocks rising sharply.\n*****\n> \u201cStocks just seem to be disconnected from everything else,\u201d said Michael Schumacher, director rates at Wells Fargo. Some bond yields, like the benchmark 10-year yield, which impacts many types of loans, were slightly higher ahead of the Treasury\u2019s record $96 billion in auctions in the coming week. But the 2-year, at a new low of 0.10%, was trading on concerns about the economy.\n*****\n> Market pros will look for Powell to comment on market speculation that the Fed could take its benchmark rate to a negative yield. Fed officials have said they have no interest in negative rates, which are being used by central banks in Europe and Japan. But for the first time this past week, traders drove futures on fed funds to show slightly negative rates in contracts starting in  November. \n*****\n> \u201cHe could quash negative yields if he wants to,\u201d said Schumacher. \u201cThe Fed has consistently argued against negative policy rates. Now there\u2019s a chance Powell could comment on this. He\u2019s commented about it, several times in the last six months.\u201d\n*****\n> Much of the gains in the stock market have been driven by big technology companies with operations that haven\u2019t been deeply affected by the coronavirus.\n*****\n> \u201cTech was the shutdown trade and small caps are the reopening,\u201d said Boockvar, noting small caps are domestically focused and are sensitive to the back-to-work trade.\n*****\n> Apple joined the reopening trade Friday, when its stock rose after it announced it would reopen some of its U.S. stores.\n*****\n> \u201cThe stock market has sort of a hall pass as the months proceed and things reopen. At some point, that hall pass is going to expire\u201d and the reopenings will have to result in rebound, Boockvar said.\n*****\n> Investors have been watching for anything that suggests state reopenings are stimulating activity.\n*****\n> Retail sales Friday will be a big focus and are expected to show sharp decline of 11%, but more like 6% when automobiles and gasoline are removed, he said.\n*****\n> In the oil market in the past week, crude was up as much as 24% as traders reacted to information that showed gasoline demand picking up around the U.S. States have been opening up at different speeds, and California was the latest to reopen some activity Friday.\n*****\n> \u201cSome of the reason the market is up because the virus curve is bending, the economic data is showing signs of a bounce. It hasn\u2019t here yet but you know it\u2019s coming. It\u2019s a global phenomenon,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. He noted that China\u2019s export numbers unexpectedly rose in April, for the first time this year.\n*****\n> Paulsen said he expects stocks to remain in an upswing.\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of value out there if you\u2019re outside the high growth in the S&P 500,\u201d he said, \u201cWhen fear is as high as it is, that\u2019s typically been a great time to lean toward risk assets. Gold is at a 50-year high relative to commodity prices. People are buying bonds at virtually zero yield. To me, there\u2019s fairly defensive behavior and scared attitudes rather than the other way around.\u201d\n*****\n> Strategists say the market could retest its March lows, but a good number say the bottom has been set.\n*****\n> \u201cI\u2019m getting more confident that we\u2019ve seen the lows, and we\u2019re starting a recovery in the stock market, but I think the volatility is going to stay there, and there will be challenges. I think the general direction is up rather than down at the moment,\u201d said Paulsen.\n*****\n> Paulsen said the fear of reinfection remains, should there be a new wave of the virus. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of terrible things that could happen and be terrible for the stock market,\u201d he said.  \u201cA headline could create an up or down week and then go away again. \u201d \n*****\n> \u201cI think the rise in the stock market is really more about a lack of sellers. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of buyers. If more people believed this is winding down ... there could be a  lot more money that\u2019s going to come back into equities, to some extent,\u201d Paulsen said.\n*****\n> Market pros are keeping an eye on yields, ahead of the government\u2019s record sized $96 billion in auctions in the coming week for 3- and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/4HGQyi7.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/2lmIrzt.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/eEihRrS.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/DR6SfIc.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fXS8KN3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8V6CfZy.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/VHY2OWA.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/G3fxr2S.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/sx0HDsl.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/udABitD.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/zujuIT6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/PxZA6w2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Market Too Far Ahead of Economy?\n\n> Another 3.2 million Americans filed for unemployment last week bringing the seven-week total to 33.5 million. This is an unprecedented streak for an unprecedented time, and it highlights the significant impact that the coronavirus pandemic shutdown is having. One small positive aspect of this week\u2019s number is the fact that it is a decline from the previous reading which lends further support to the possibility that the market\u2019s lows of March could be the bottom and that bottom could hold based upon the historical correlation of jobless claims and past market bottoms that we covered in a recent post.\n\n> However, the seven-week total is an unsettling number that suggests the road back to \u201cnormal\u201d could be longer than the market appears to currently expect. It is getting increasingly more challenging to envision 33.5 million Americans returning to work as quickly as they left. And with NASDAQ returning to positive for the year in today\u2019s trading it may be time to wonder if the market\u2019s brisk recovery is possibly too far ahead of the actual economy.\n\n> One early sign that the rally may be getting well ahead of the economy can be seen in the following chart of cumulative daily advance/decline lines for NYSE, NASDAQ, Russell 2000 and the S&P 500. The recent trend since the end of April has been lower while the indexes have managed to move modestly higher. This suggests that fewer and fewer stocks are still participating in the rally. Historically when this persisted the major indexes frequently failed to move meaningfully higher and often turned lower.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ff6838e7d4a8493b62fad589a840223/2faca2fd2c71ed13-d0/s500x750/93ab9274fcf5f85882ed91b1eeb70ec5bcc54b88.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Market Gains in Celebration of Mother\u2019s Day\n\n> With just a few days remaining to Mother\u2019s Day, today\u2019s post is also a reminder. Over the last twenty-five years on the Friday before Mother\u2019s Day the Dow Jones Industrials have gained ground seventeen times. On the Monday after, DJIA has advanced seventeen times over the same time period. Average gain on Friday has been 0.20% and a respectable 0.36% on Monday. However, in five of the last eight years, the Monday following Mother\u2019s Day has been down. Last year, DJIA suffered its worst post Mother\u2019s Day loss, off 2.38%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/91ef736cb31d1b665b1933aa28dc680c/577c38f8de114a58-46/s500x750/e29f63d6af8b2ae4a172b03a5a3ba2af28fe345b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Group Breadth Improving From a Record Low Base\n\n> After a disastrous late February and early March period, breadth among S&P 500 groups cratered to the point where not a single one of the S&P 500's 24 industry groups were above their 50-day moving average. Before the most recent occurrence, that's something we hadn't seen since early 2019.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/050820-Groups-above-520DMA.png))**\n\n> While there have been numerous instances in the last few years where every industry group was below its 50-DMA, the most recent period was unique in that it lasted more than four full weeks (21 trading days). Going all the way back to 1990, there has only been one other period where every industry group was below its 50-day moving average for as long as it just was. That was during the depths of the financial crisis in the 21-day stretch ending 11/3/08. It took a bear market of more than a year to finally reach that level back then, but this time around, it took less than two months. Besides that period, there has never been another four-week stretch where every industry group was below its 50-day moving average.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/050820-Groups-above-520DMA-Streaks.png))**\n\n> Overall breadth readings have already improved in terms of industry groups above their 50-day moving averages, but at this point, the number of industry groups with rising 50-day moving averages remains extremely depressed at just 8.3% as of midday Friday. Similar to the streak above, during the most recent period every group had a declining 50-day moving average for 26 straight days, and that was also the longest such streak since 2008. Granted, this is a lagging indicator and should improve the longer equities remain around current levels, but it once again serves as a reminder of how steep the declines actually were.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/050820-Groups-rising-50DMA.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Sector Relative Strength\n\n> Although the S&P 500 (SPY) is down around 1% over the past week, there are two sectors that have made a push higher: Communication Services (XLC) and Technology (XLK). While these moves have left both sectors in overbought territory, a snapshot from our Trend Analyzer tool shows that Tech's rally has brought it into the green YTD.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/050720-TA.png))**\n\n> Technology's outperformance is nothing new. As shown in the relative strength charts from our Sector Snapshot below, Technology has been a serial outperformer versus the S&P 500 for pretty much all of the past year (a rising line indicates outperformance versus the S&P 500 and vice versa). As for the other sectors, Health Care has also seen some drastic outperformance over the past few months. Communication Services and Consumer Discretionary have also seen some outperformance in recent weeks. Contrary to Technology, Energy, Financials, Industrials, and Materials have all been consistent underperformers over the past year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/RS.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Performance on Earnings Days\n\n> Roughly 1,300 companies have reported since the start of earnings season on 4/13 when the first of the big banks kicked things off. For those stocks that have beaten EPS estimates, the reaction has not been as strong as past years with just a 9 bps difference between this earnings season and all seasons since 2001. On the other hand, those that have missed EPS have not been as badly punished dropping 0.86% compared to an average drop of 3.56% since 2001. For all stocks, the average gain of 0.79% this earnings season is much stronger than the 0.06% gain of all other seasons.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/Earn-React-4.png))**\n\n> With stock price reactions being generally positive this season, most of the gain has come at the open. Stocks reporting earnings have gapped up an average of 1.24%. But intraday they have tended to sell-off, averaging a 0.44% decline from open to close.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/Earn-React-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$UAA** \n> * **$AMAT** \n> * **$CLF** \n> * **$MAR** \n> * **$CSCO** \n> * **$CPE** \n> * **$JD** \n> * **$INO** \n> * **$KOS** \n> * **$ON** \n> * **$TLRY** \n> * **$CAH** \n> * **$ACB** \n> * **$AN** \n> * **$WIX** \n> * **$SDC** \n> * **$GBDC** \n> * **$NCLH** \n> * **$DUK** \n> * **$NBEV**\n> * **$ICPT** \n> * **$SPG** \n> * **$CYBR** \n> * **$DDOG** \n> * **$CEVA** \n> * **$MYL** \n> * **$CHH** \n> * **$HMC** \n> * **$ET** \n> * **$LOGI** \n> * **$OAS** \n> * **$NVAX** \n> * **$ZBH** \n> * **$PRTK** \n> * **$ABUS** \n> * **$GWPH** \n> * **$VCTR** \n> * **$SALT** \n> * **$WVE** \n> * **$GNC** \n> * **$AMRX** \n> * **$ETR** \n> * **$NOG**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/sx0HDsl.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/SeXyhoI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/dp54bLF.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 5.11.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NOhb3L5.png))\n\n\n> # ***Monday 5.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/GVcHqQw.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/II5ukMy.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 5.12.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1RbrpI3.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 5.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FrASNRG.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 5.13.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/tZs8hms.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 5.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/GwtxPwV.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 5.14.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jUwjUuj.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 5.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/s2yx68v.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 5.15.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ofgb6gF.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 5.15.20 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ofgb6gF.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Under Armour, Inc. $9.98\n> **Under Armour, Inc.
