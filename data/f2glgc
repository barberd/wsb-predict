That shits for pussies and those with way more money than you owe.\" \n\nSo I will take this opportunity to say that I will not kill myself \n\n____________________________________________________________\n\n**PLAYS:**\n\n*plays are always in USD*\n\nBTO - 01x 21 FEB 2020 SPY 337C @ 1.11 (yesterday)\n\nSTC - 01x 21 FEB 2020 SPY 337C @ 1.89 (bought @1.11)\n\nSTC - 08 14 FEB 2020 SPY 332C @4.44 (bought @1.67)\n\nSTC - 16x 14 FEB 2020 SPY 334C @ 2.82 (bought @1.99)\n\nBTO - 10x 13 MAR 2020 MSFT 200C @2.57\n\nBTO - 04x 21 FEB 2020 MSFT 205C @0.48\n\nBTO - 08x 06 MAR 2020 SPY 338C @3.39\n\nBTO - 08x 13 MAR 2020 SPY 339C @3.38\n\nReasoning behind plays: \n\nWanted to lock in the gains from the gap up this morning and just give me more time on my calls in case SPY dropped a bit. \n\nInvested in MSFT thanks to /u/blunt__nation who gave me the great advice and FOMO of investing in MSFT calls [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f1xwqd/what_happened_to_the_guy_that_said_he_would/fh9x6ps/?context=3)\n\nEven though I put on the front of thinking I'd regret it later, it slowly ate at me until I finally did it. \n\n\n**Account totals:** \n\nCash - 2 CAD or 2 USD\n\nOpen - 9200 CAD or 6900 USD\n\n**Total Equity:**\n\n7787 CAD or 5864 USD \n\n**Profit/Loss all time**\n\n+4275 USD\n\nGoal - 120k USD\n\n\n\nI'm only going to be updating on days I make plays so if I didn't post means I'm just holding the same positions.\n\nSomeone suggested including my profits in the post title so will be doing that from now on. Started with 3500 CAD or 2600 USD. \n\nI am also meeting with another loan shark to get another 50k later this month. Will update you guys on that if it goes through. \n\nI am not really going to be doing weekly YOLOs or anything, more so just buying calls a few weeks out which is pretty boring which is why I don't make these posts everyday, only when I make trades (yesterday was just a small trade of $100 which is why I didn't make a post) \n\nThank you for coming to my tedtalk.", "created_utc": 1581461062, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f2glgc/day_11_of_14k_loan_from_loan_shark_162_ytd/", "is_self": true}
