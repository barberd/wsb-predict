It got me to thinking, and I realized that it will be WSB, but in spirit, not in activity, that causes the next recession, because the eternal YOLO retard causes all recessions.\n\nRecessions are not really that complicated. They happen when rich but dumb and/or greedy and/or insufficiently cautious business owners don't properly manage risk, expose themselves to a level of losses in a tail-risk event that they're not even aware of being possible, and as a result need to downsize unexpectedly, firing people who overwhelmingly have 1 single skill and a lot of debt thanks to our college system, and thus those people cannot find new employment and make their own payments on the house, car, student loans, etc.. They default, which causes huge stress on the financial sector, which then fires its people, who then default on their payments, and it causes a race to the bottom as banks stop lending to consumers and corporations, who need that liquidity to operate and continue to make payments. It's a side effect of hyperspecialization of labor/knowledge, high levels of leverage and debt at all levels of society, and improper evaluation of risks. It's what happens when the entire country begins to operate like WSB, and we've been doing that to varying degrees for decades. When you see people say things like \"This time it's different\", \"Why manage risks?\", \"We hold no responsibility for these products\", \"we need this off our balance sheet\" and \"Literally cannot go tits up\" outside of this autism conclave, you should start preparing accordingly.\n\n\nRecessions are stopped by some big technological development or macroeconomic event that props up earnings (think post WW2 earnings boom) or by artificial activity to stimulate the economy by the government or the Fed.\n\nWhen you see credit spreads widen, that's when you know a recession is impending if not already there. It means that lending institutions have begun to evaluate the same old stuff as much riskier than it used to be, and they usually only do that when they've already taken heavy losses.\n\nIf you want to see the next recession coming, look at bond markets. That's where the credit widening starts. And corporate bonds are looking about as retarded from a risk management standpoint as leveraged banking products looked in 2007.", "created_utc": 1573484407, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dutiit/recessions_happen_when_society_on_aggregate_acts/", "is_self": true}
