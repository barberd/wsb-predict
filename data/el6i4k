I could get fucked tomorrow, but I like the setup, so I play it because it's a high probability setup. \n\nExhibit 6: CRM **A weekly BIG boy triangle:** [https://www.tradingview.com/x/8hg3SEPH/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/8hg3SEPH/)   beautiful, ain't she? Zoomed in: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/8hg3SEPH/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/8hg3SEPH/)   You can see where I tried for an entry (blue arrow) but it didn't work out. Totally fine because stop was defined. \n\nThere are many more examples, but you get the point. These triangle are high probability setups for breakouts.
