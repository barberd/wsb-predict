I personally think a lot of these mediocre restaurant groups are getting what's long over due cause they serve shitty overpriced food. \nI\u2019m sure there are other vulnerable industries that don\u2019t have the prestige needed to be bailout worthy but I\u2019m too fat and dumb to think of them. \n\n[gains and positions](https://imgur.com/a/6dkZBXu)\n\nSPY Puts \n1- 216p 3/23 \n2- 230p 3/31\n1- 240p 3/31\n\nYum \n2x $65p 3/27 avg cost$3 \n2x $65p 4/17 avg cost$5\n\nBLMN \n4x $7.50p 4/17 avg cost $1.30\n\nDRI \n4x $35p 4/17 avg cost $3.60\n\nKroger Calls \nSLV calls \n\nTLDR: some companies will be too big to fail and too important to realize the losses they deserve.\n\nEdit: for those who want to see all time...
