Short that \n\nBUT WAIT you can't short since no shares to borrow. What do.\n\nOpen a synthetic short (long put, short call) pick a strike that's a bit lower than spot, but not too low to prevent assignment.\n\nPick a date, I picked July 2, if you want to be super safe you can pick July 10, the latter significantly limits your upside since you are paying for the extra week, but you can 100% (actually guaranteed since you can exercise your warrants by then unless your broker fucks you or you can't meet margin calls in case of share spike before then) make $5 at least off of every warrant.\n\nWhy July 2, it's a balance between the super safe July 10 and the not so safe Jun 26.\n\nIf you want to be extra ballsy you can do Jun 26, the risk is of course more retards buy next week, you burn your theta, spread widens even more, putting you at a loss temporarily, forcing you to fork over more capital that you may not have to roll the options.\n\nTldr positions\n\nLong NKLAW\nLong July 2 $60 P\nShort July 2 $60 C\n\nLITERALLY FREE MONEY", "created_utc": 1592505769.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbkbds/cant_go_tits_up_nkla_play/", "is_self": true}
