Turns out he's fucking 6'5 or 196 cm. I think we can all admit that there's no fucking way he'd manage to scam venture capital folk as hard as he did if he was a balding 5'10 man with a weak jaw\n\nTheranos and Elizabeth Holmes too. I guess she's not too attractive to the average wsb poster but in the end what matters is whether old rich men find her attractive or not and she was able to string them along like dogs on a leash, getting all those old ultra-connected farts on the board of Theranos even though anybody who knew a bit about the technical aspects of their field could see the scam from a mile away.\n\nTurns out all it takes for a company to reach 10 billion valuation is ONE person who can sufficiently stimulate old men's shriveled dicks\n\nThe downside is that these good looking folk seem to have a tendency to get high on their own farts hence Theranos and WeWork being my prime examples. This means that you need to have a solid exit strategy for kinda these companies, but the amplifying effect of the attractiveness of the CEO still stands\n\nNow is the technical part\n\nLet f(t) be the function that determines the valuation of a company over time, with 0 being its foundation\n\nLet g(t) be the intrinsic valuation of company in a theoretically perfect world such that all necessary information is always available to all market participants\n\nThen f(t) = ((AQ) * g(t)) where AQ is the attractiveness quotient of the CEO\n\nNow we all know that if a company was led by Quasimodo it'd fucking fail instantly, so AQ is the result of a multiplication with the attractiveness of the CEO. But the more attractive the CEO is the more pronounced this effect gets, so there's an exponential effect as well.\n\nThus my claim is that AQ = ( x * (a ^ x)) or a similar function where a is a constant and x is the attractiveness of the CEO over 10. The attractiveness is measured from the perspective of old (60 and above) men for private companies and from the perspective of average aged men for public companies. Note that these men also have to be comfortably flexible in their sexual orientation.", "created_utc": 1569509947, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d9ks6y/quantifying_the_effects_of_ceo_attractiveness_in/", "is_self": true}
