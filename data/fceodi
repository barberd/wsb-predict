The only remedy I knew was to get nasty, real nasty.  \n\nSo I became a gay ass fucking bear and it felt great. It felt wrong but it felt great. I saw hundreds of billions wiped off the market, maybe even trillions, idk, numbers where never my strong suit.  \n\nSo I gloated about my switch up. About how the end was nigh, and it felt wonderful. As each point was lost on the SPY my ween grew.  \n\nBut the Bull God has a funny way of not dying. He never dies. I\u2019ve seen the error of my ways. My the Bill God reign supreme and May all Bears bask in the glory of his undying low hanging mountain oysters.", "created_utc": 1583166869, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fceodi/all_hail_the_bull_god_pt2_bears_get_mandingod/", "is_self": true}
