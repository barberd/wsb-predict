Now, after hours of browsing this subreddit, I've decided which earning stocks will give free tendies next week.\n\n**GOOGLe** is prolly the hardest one to predict. It has been tumbling for a few days now and monday it'll probably fall even harder so it's a cheap buy. Even if the earnings fall flat it'll quickly recover anyways because it's fuckin' google.\n\n**DISney** has also been tumbling a bit and will MOON with earnings. They had lots of great Star Wars shit (Mandalorian, themepark...) and disney + will do great cuz it just will. Don't bet against the mouse.\n\n**ATVIsion Blizzard** will MOON the hardest of 'em all. They're cheap right now and last year was gr8. They keep selling shit and Classic is a thing. They had lots of shit like Hong Kong and now with their newest game being a huge flop which drives the stock down but guess what? Earnings don't give a shit about that! Everyone's busy jerking off because Blizzard made another 69 billion from their cash shop.\n\nSource: am 140 IQ autist", "created_utc": 1580639476, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/exmmn3/predictions_for_next_weeks_earnings_literally/", "is_self": true}
