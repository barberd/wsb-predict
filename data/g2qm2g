{"id": "g2qm2g", "title": "Mexican Economy on Fire - But Don't Short Emerging Market ETFs Yet", "selftext": "The Mexican govt led by a socialist president ( a real one and not just the silhoutes we have in the USA)  refuses to bailout companies.  I am sure that he would but b/c the MXP is not a global reserve currency the central bank's hands are tied.  Unfortunately ETFs like EWW have been rising or staying flat b/c they take their cue from the SPY and DIA.  I say this as a May EWW  27 put holder since February.  The  long term fundamentals are terrible for the Mexican economy so if you must short wait for a big up day on the US indices, look at SPY and DIA Fib retracements for entry and exit points then buy as long dated slightly OTM puts as possible.  Like 3-4 months minimum.  \n\n[https://wolfstreet.com/2020/04/09/in-lockdown-with-exports-remittances-plunging-mexicos-economy-slides-banks-companies-clamor-for-bailout-government-refuses/](https://wolfstreet.com/2020/04/09/in-lockdown-with-exports-remittances-plunging-mexicos-economy-slides-banks-companies-clamor-for-bailout-government-refuses/)", "created_utc": 1587080673.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2qm2g/mexican_economy_on_fire_but_dont_short_emerging/", "is_self": true}
