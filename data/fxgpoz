{"id": "fxgpoz", "title": "We have made HISTORY. We have SMASHED bear market RECORDS!", "selftext": "The market crash of 1987, so called \"Black Monday,\" created an immediate bear market in a single day, with markets declining more than 22%.\n\nThis crash, which was largely blamed on computer trading, took a mere three months to rise out of bear market territory, making it one of the shortest bear markets in US history.\n\nI'm glad to announce we have COMPLETELY DESTROYED those records, with the 2020 bear market lasting a mere 19 DAYS!!!\n\nTurns out a computer glitch counts for more than a global pandemic, economic shutdown, and record unemployment!\n\nMany puts were sacrificed, but it was worth it to have our names etched in the history books.\n\nNow go out there and BUY THOSE CALLS, because the new law of the markets now is \"STOCKS ONLY GO UP!!!!\"\n\nPosition: Buy calls. Doesn't matter what or when. Just fucking buy calls. Jesus christ.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uepj-he73P0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uepj-he73P0)", "created_utc": 1586386198.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxgpoz/we_have_made_history_we_have_smashed_bear_market/", "is_self": true}
