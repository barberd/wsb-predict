However, TSLA did spike on multiple days, and the IV on my calls exploded (wrote them at 180% IV and BTC them at 350+ IV) that caused my cash requirement to increase significantly and resulted in a margin call and subsequent forced liquidation (Buy to Close) at significant losses. The shitty thing about this is that $TSLA closed the week below the strike price of my calls, and I would have gotten out with a profit if my broker didn't liquidate me.\n\nThis same exact thing happened with $SPCE with me writing $35C and $40C calls early this week, and was margin called and liquidated and the stock closed the week at $33.87. \n\nLessons learned:\n\n* Writing naked calls on anything is a terrible fucking idea and if either the price of your security moves against you and/or IV explodes, you are at risk of being margin called. If that happens,  you literally have no choice but to liquidate and would not be able to bank on the security moving in your favor in the time remaining on your contracts.\n* Fidelity is much more conservative with margin than almost any other broker I've used, (Charles Schwab, RH) and would margin call you even if you still have a significant amount of capital on your account. The day I was margin called, I still had 60k account value left.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/omx9fYS](https://imgur.com/a/omx9fYS)", "created_utc": 1582430305, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f848m3/lost_93k_selling_naked_tsla_and_spce_calls/", "is_self": true}
