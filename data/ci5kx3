Entire fucking states have banned the consumption of beef.

Bullshit. You can sell whatever the fuck you want and call it food in India and nobody will care. The digestive system of an Indian is capable of processing high-level radioactive waste. Plus the people there have never tasted beef in their lives. So you can literally sell anything as a \"beef alternative\" and nobody will notice. Come up with some cheap formulation that costs 1$/kg. You can even set up the factory in India so you pay no labor costs. Pay a few bribes and you don't even need to invest in nonsense like \"worker's safety\" or \"pollution controls\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone at BYND knew this they would be doing it instantly. But they evidently have no clue about what they are doing. The fact that they haven't adopted this strategy is a clear indicator of autistic leadership.
