{"id": "c9xc4p", "title": "BYND meat not selling", "selftext": "This is open for discussion. I was just food shopping and i figured i would try to find the beyond meat products to see how theyre selling, where they are located relative to competitors/related products and what their branding was like. It took me a good minute of scanning the section before i could find the beyond meat products. Nothing made them stand out. And to add, both choices were very full. Maybe 1-2 missing. I asked the guy stocking the shelf how often they rotate/add product and he said since meat products go bad, they only add products once they get low, and that the beyond meat products have been getting thrown out more and more by the week. Plus to add, a pack of 6 beyond meat plant based sausages were selling for $16.99 were a pack of very well known primo sausages were selling 6 for $8.99. Even when i went out of my way to look specifically for the beyond meat product, it was overwhelmingly overtaken by everything else in its section. Nothing made it stand out. If you arent sold on the product BEFORE going into the grocery store, i find the odds someone buying the beyond meat product over another very low. Add the added cost of almost double and you alienate a large group of people who want to try it but refuse to pay that much. \n\nI would love an open discussion about the product and its future. Competition it might face and obstacles they have to overcome to stand out in this space. \nTry and keep the stock action out of your discussion but no reply will go unread!", "created_utc": 1562440104, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c9xc4p/bynd_meat_not_selling/", "is_self": true}
