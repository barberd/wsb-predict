When I saw the post-market last night, I was pretty sure we were in for some volatility, but holy smokes!\n\nDespite the volatility, nothing -actually- happened, which is pretty interesting. As usual, discounting the gap during the pre-market, we actually only ended the day up \\~1.2%. This fits our model, but we should definitely consider our possible volatility contributors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCuomo NYC extends deadline to May 15\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-update.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-update.html)\n\nSmall business portion of stimulus out of money\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/16/small-business-rescue-loan-program-hits-349-billion-limit-and-is-now-out-of-money.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/16/small-business-rescue-loan-program-hits-349-billion-limit-and-is-now-out-of-money.html)\n\nUnemployment hits another 5.25 million, bringing us to 22+ million, and an interesting number being thrown around is that we have now wiped out every job added since 2008. Huh. V Shaped, eh?\n\n[https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/us-coronavirus-unemployment-claims-jump-april-11](https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/us-coronavirus-unemployment-claims-jump-april-11)\n\n7 Midwest states join forces to discuss reopening:\n\n[https://apnews.com/e9dea7912bce46723a4e36fb43e38f43](https://apnews.com/e9dea7912bce46723a4e36fb43e38f43)\n\nTrump threatens to install Judges via Adjournment\n\n[https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/04/16/out-dictators-handbook-trump-threatens-adjourn-congress-unilaterally-install-judges](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/04/16/out-dictators-handbook-trump-threatens-adjourn-congress-unilaterally-install-judges)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo we definitely have some back and forth rabble rabbling going on in the last 24 hours. The good news, is that our model is holding fast. Although today was volatile, the lack of actually going anywhere is a good indicator that the market still has no idea what to do. I haven't seen any new bankruptcy announcements, though there has been a spike in 'food banks' news.[https://www.motherjones.com/food/2020/04/these-photos-show-the-staggering-food-bank-lines-across-america/](https://www.motherjones.com/food/2020/04/these-photos-show-the-staggering-food-bank-lines-across-america/)[https://apnews.com/0667573c06ffd15bcebb58f656b1630d](https://apnews.com/0667573c06ffd15bcebb58f656b1630d)\n\n[https://www.bridgemi.com/urban-affairs/detroit-food-banks-overrun-coronavirus-demand](https://www.bridgemi.com/urban-affairs/detroit-food-banks-overrun-coronavirus-demand)\n\n[https://komonews.com/news/nation-world/pandemic-provokes-spike-in-demand-for-food-pantries-in-us](https://komonews.com/news/nation-world/pandemic-provokes-spike-in-demand-for-food-pantries-in-us)\n\n[https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8218267/Thousands-cars-line-Los-Angeles-food-bank.html](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8218267/Thousands-cars-line-Los-Angeles-food-bank.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFood scarcity is a solid step towards the crash. We're hearing stories of farmers who are trashing their production due to inability to profit, very similar to conditions in the great depression:\n\n[https://www.foxnews.com/media/food-supply-chain-not-set-up-to-get-milk-from-farmers-to-food-banks](https://www.foxnews.com/media/food-supply-chain-not-set-up-to-get-milk-from-farmers-to-food-banks)\n\n[https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zxy3k2p/revision/5](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zxy3k2p/revision/5)\n\nWhile I'm not judging the supply chain, I understand you can't simply convert 1 product to another, and it was not a supply chain built for this sudden shock/demand/etc, it is a noticeably similar issue, so I potentially expect correlatably (is this a word?) similar results.  Farming is a high cost, low margin activity, and farmers have been known to suffer terribly during recessions in general:\n\n[https://www.farmprogress.com/how-agriculture-affected-economic-crisis](https://www.farmprogress.com/how-agriculture-affected-economic-crisis)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrent thoughts:\n\nI'm not convinced it's time to march yet, but rather that this is more a sounding of the drums, beating of the chests, etc. I wouldn't be surprised to see it die back down for a bit. Food pantries just starting to run dry or be taxed means people have still eaten recently. Something I'm expecting to see, is a drastic increase in cash-out-refi attempts, as people search to find money under the mattress.\n\n[https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/mortgage-refinancing-and-economic-activity/](https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/mortgage-refinancing-and-economic-activity/)\n\nThis puts a big burden on the already taxed banking system, who need liquidity (not a mortgage) to weather the down turn, and in turn puts a lot of debt into the economy. Not exactly the most helpful thing during a liquidity crisis. In turn, if your money becomes worth less, due to inflation, you can be hit a second time. Add in the impending housing cost reduction (as happens during all recession/depressions) and you have  a recipe for a lot of underwater folks, which means reduction in the sales of homes. Folks who lose their income and attempt to sell will potentially find themselves trapped under a Acme\u2122 Anvil they cannot lift, and lose $50k cash (or more) when their $200k home becomes worth $150k overnight. As a home owner, what are your best options?\n\nRisky: Refi early, pull cash and dump into an investment vehicle you can ride out a few years. Ensure that your new payment is sufficiently low to be an easy payment from a 1 income (in the case of 2 parents) or 1/2 income position, as jobs will get scarcer and less lucrative when 22 million people are all competing to ask me if I want fries with that. You're likely to go under water, so make sure you're making that money work for you while you're stuck in the home. Timed correctly, this can make you wealthy all on its own, but respect the risk. Stock prices may drop before they rise again, and if you're not secure short term, you might not make anything before you have to sell your stock to pay for groceries.\n\nSafer: Refi early (as long as the rate is good) and don't fucking touch the equity, in fact, if you're super worried about potential loss of income, if you have extra and can significantly impact your monthly payment, feel free to lump sum it in and turn that payment into pennies per month. If you're friends with people you can stand who currently rent, consider doubling down with them for a year or two for everyone's sake. The bad news: You're still likely to go under water, so make sure you're reducing the payment enough to basically guarantee you can pay it. You'll need to ride out its return to value to not lose money.\n\nWorst option: Take the money out and buy a new TV because your current one is too small to quarantine with. Dump 1/2 into RH SPY 220P 4/20 and yell \"DIAMOND HANDS\" from the roof as your wife gets into her boyfriends car. Having all that equity in cash might seem like a great choice, but if you're worried about inflation, cash is the wrong place to be. Unless you really need the cash, don't spend your house.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSomething interesting I noticed just now, is that we're seeing a huge climb in the post market after a brief consolidation. That's interesting, because normally there aren't relatively drastic changes in the post market, but rather the pre-market. I'm not sure what this implies right now, but it is the 2nd day with volatile post-market in a row, so we'll have to watch tomorrow for more correlation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCalls for tomorrow:\n\nI see some financial companies with earnings tomorrow, and none seem to have taken big loss days yet, so i'm inclined to think they will be any different. Schlumberger Oil may take a decent hit, as oil as done fairly poorly over all, and extensions on the lock down were just extended some places.\n\nI see no reason amazon wouldn't continue to be a strong force, and I see no reason the market overall should have another 0-2% green day, barring some sort of news. The wild buy-fest in the post market leaves me hesitant to assume a gap one way or the other. I'm curious if it might be some sort of hedge against the overnight markets.\n\nAs usual, I continue to play S&P intra-daily scalps, and that has been decent. I don't find overnights to be guaranteed enough yet to warrant the risk by holding anything overnight. Interestingly, despite volatility increasing, volume was overall down again today (119.3m -> 115m), so we're still on track for this to be an ever-thinning ledge we stand atop of.\n\nedit: Catalyst news potentially: (credit to u/[TravelingSkeptic](https://www.reddit.com/user/TravelingSkeptic/))\n\n [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/16/gilead-stock-surges-after-report-says-coronavirus-drug-trial-shows-encouraging-early-results.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/16/gilead-stock-surges-after-report-says-coronavirus-drug-trial-shows-encouraging-early-results.html) \n\nRegardless of whether its true or not (the effectiveness, that is), I would expect stronger up green day tomorrow, assuming this news is circulated via the presidential briefing and the various media outlets, which would be reasonable to expect them to do. I wouldn't expect this news to cause a permanent spike, as the economic impacts are not so simple that a pill can cure them, but it seems reasonable that we might get another 'level up' out of this. People love good news, and its likely a hasty rubber stamp would find its way to the FDA paperwork to approve this for use to treat CV19. It doesn't appear to cure anything, however, but rather expedite recovery from and decrease severity of symptoms, so this doesn't take anything out of the circuit.
