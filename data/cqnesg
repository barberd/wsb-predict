{"id": "cqnesg", "title": "Germany is going to tank hard", "selftext": "Ok here me out: Germany\u2019s economy isn\u2019t looking to good right now, we all know that. But I know something you guys don\u2019t know. I\u2019m German and I read the newspaper. I understand the country. I know how people think.\nI can guarantee German stocks are overvalued right now. Why? Because most investors are American and they don\u2019t understand that Germany isn\u2019t the US.\n\nWhat I\u2019m essentially saying is that Germany won\u2019t stimulate the economy even though they should.\nWhy? Well to understand that I\u2019ll have to take you back on a quick history lesson, back to the financial crisis. Back then Germany wasn\u2019t competitive at all, stuff sucked, companies didn\u2019t want to invest in Germany because work was expensive. The SPD, the \u201esocialist\u201c party made a bunch of reforms back then, reducing cost of labor. That shit worked really well, as we all know. Germany has been doing great.\nWell here comes the interesting point: people hated the SPD for that. They were at like 40% back then, they\u2019ve been nosediving harder than analfarmers portfolio. \n\nThis basically showed all parties people don\u2019t want effective economic stimulus, they want their Gouvernement money. They don\u2019t understand that the right thing might be to have people get less.\n \nReason two why they won\u2019t do something against the recession: the biggest party, the CDU, the Merkel guys, have been tanking as well. But they have one thing people like about them: \u201eschwarze Null\u201c, their black zero. Basically the Gouvernement not taking up any debt. Thing is we already know they\u2019re not gonna cut benefits because people hate that and if you don\u2019t take up debt and don\u2019t reduce spending you definitely can\u2019t stimulate the economy, especially when incomes and thus taxes are falling.\n\nThird reason why: \u201eDie Gr\u00fcnen\u201c, the Green Party is on the rise. And these people are left wing and don\u2019t give a fuck about the economy. They see companies as the source of CO2. These fuckers are gonna raise taxes, not reduce them. \n\nFourth reason: \u201edie Linke\u201c, the left party, the former east Germany party and the AFD, basically the German Trump party, are on the rise. And you don\u2019t want tarriff man or socialists when a recession hits. These fuckers won\u2019t be part of the gouvernment but they\u2019re gonna make the Gouvernements work way harder than it already is.\n\n\nI think you already know about the ECB but what you may not know is that the German people want higher rates so their fixed income bank deposit shitshows can give them money. Germany is going to fight the ECB while Italy and Greece are going to force the ECB to lower rates to never seen lows.\n\nAnd this is only going to hurt when the recession hits. But Germany is already not looking to good. And tariff man and Gyna aren\u2019t making this look better. So when the recession hits Germany\u2019s parties are going to continue giving freebies to the people while leaving taxes this high. Germany is walking right into a Recession and no one is going to stop it. \n\nTLDR: German Parties and people too dumb to do the right thing, and as soon as the recession hits hard shits gonna hit the fan.", "created_utc": 1565860291, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cqnesg/germany_is_going_to_tank_hard/", "is_self": true}
