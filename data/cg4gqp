Once a user has entered their payment information, the app not only remembers it, but also removes the choice to swap back to Google Play for future purchases, he wrote.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge difference,\" Schachter said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly high-margin business for Google bringing in billions of dollars,\" he said.\n\nThe shares of Tinder\u2019s parent company, Match Group Inc., spiked 5% when Schachter\u2019s note was published on Thursday. Shares of Google parent Alphabet Inc. were little changed.\n\nApple and Google launched their app stores in 2008, and they soon grew into powerful marketplaces that matched the creations of millions of independent developers with billions of smartphone users. In exchange, the companies take as much as 30% of revenue. The app economy is expected to grow to $157 billion in 2022, according to App Annie projections.\n\n\nAs the market expands, a growing revolt has been gaining steam over the past year. Spotify Technology SA filed an antitrust complaint with the European Commission earlier this year, claiming the cut Apple takes amounts to a tax on competitors. Netflix Inc. has recently stopped letting Apple users subscribe via the App Store and Epic Games Inc. said last year it wouldn\u2019t distribute Fortnite, one of the world\u2019s most popular video games, through Google Play.\n\nMatch declined to answer questions about whether the company was also investigating bypassing Apple\u2019s App Store. Match is expected to discuss the payment flow change with analysts and investors during its next earnings call on Aug. 6.\n\n\u201cAt Match Group, we constantly test new updates and features to offer convenience, control and choice to our users,\" Justine Sacco, a spokeswoman for Match, wrote in an email. \u201cWe will always try to provide options that benefit their experience and offering payment options is one example of this.\"\n\nGoogle didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nOf the high-profile companies that have shunned the App store, Match is the only one that has changed the payment method in-app, Schachter noted. Others have instead forced subscribers back to their own websites to enter payment information.\n\nTinder\u2019s move could spark a domino effect.\n\n\u201cTinder is relatively small and it won\u2019t have a massive impact, but the concern is if this grows and gets into gaming apps as it starts moving forward,\" Schachter said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see a lot of other companies potentially trying to experiment with this.\"", "created_utc": 1563745156, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cg4gqp/tinder_bypasses_google_play_joining_revolt/", "is_self": true}
