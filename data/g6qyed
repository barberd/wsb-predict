{"id": "g6qyed", "title": "$FTCH revenue set to double by end of year", "selftext": "TL;DR The forced shift of the luxury fashion industry from mostly physical retail to more online sales will dramatically increase Farfetch\u2019s sales and market share. The stock was unfairly punished because of its 2019 merger and because it is a luxury goods company, which allows us to enter at a cheap valuation. Even if the luxury clothing market shrinks 20%  Farfetch's market share will more than double leaving their sales dramatically higher. \n\n**The stock was extremely undervalued before the crash:**\n\nFarfetch was founded in 2007 two weeks before Lehman Brothers went bankrupt. The stock IPO\u2019d in 2019 around 23$ a share. The stock faced headwinds and eventually dropped 40% in a day after they bought New Guards Group for $675 million. New Guards Group (NGG) is a fashion distribution company who owns brands like Off-White, Palm Angels, Heron Preston, and other streetwear brands. On paper this deal looks retarded. Why is a tech company with significant cash burn buying a clothing company, which seemingly goes against Farfetch'd asset light model. However, the market was completely wrong. New Guards Group at the time had $95mm of annual cash flow with consistent revenue growth. Essentially they bought $95 million dollars of cash flow at a 7x multiple. This deal is crazy cheap, a strategic often pays double digit multiples when they buy another company. Furthermore, NGG is a fashion distribution company not a manufacturer. They sign these deals with designers to design the clothing and then NGG pays manufacturers to make it. Since NGG doesn't actually make the clothing they fit with Farfetch's asset light business model. Despite all this the market still hated the merger causing the stock to drop to 8$ a share in mid 2019. Company had great year end earnings, driving the stock up to 12. The stock then cratered and rallied with the market and currently sits around 12$.\n\n**Farfetch is going to become the number 1 player in Luxury goods:**\n\nFarfetch was a great investment before Beerflu, but now it is one of the best investments out there. They are poised to have a dramatic increase in market share. Traditionally 88% of luxury goods are purchased physically in store. For the boutique fashion stores that sell on Farfetch 70% of their sales come from physical stores. Lastly, China accounts for $100 billion of luxury purchases with $70 billion of those purchases happening while they travel. All three of these trends are going to dramatically change. According to Farfetch\u2019s recent preliminary Q1 filing \u201cChina Region GMV in latter two months of Q1 2020 grew faster than full year 2019.\u201d GMV stands for Gross Merchandising Value, which is the total value of goods sold on their platform. In two months that number grew more in China than it did all of last year. This move to online purchasing is mirrored in other luxury fashion company\u2019s recent earnings reports. Analysts expected LVMH\u2019s clothing sales to drop 15.8% and instead they only dropped 10%. This was driven completely by online sales since most of LVMH\u2019s physical stores are closed. \n\nIn addition to the shift online, most of Farfetch\u2019s competition is going bankrupt. Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Ave, and Nordstroms are all likely to not survive this downturn. Neiman Marcus is already considering bankruptcy, and the other physical high fashion retailers are not far behind them. This reduction in competition will further contribute to Farfetch\u2019s increase in market share. Due to the market shift to online and reduction in competition, I would be shocked if Farfetch\u2019s market share didn\u2019t double this year. \n\n**Just because they sell luxury clothing doesn\u2019t mean they will struggle in an economic downturn:**\n\nThe luxury clothing industry will likely shrink in the short run, given the lock down and the economic hardship. However, Farfetch\u2019s total sales will still dramatically increase due to their rise in market share. Even if the overall industry shrinks 20% in the short run, Farfetch\u2019s market share will more than double, leaving their total sales in a better place than before the crash. Furthermore, most of Farfetch\u2019s sales and revenue comes from extremely wealthy, price insensitive customers. 20% of Farfetch\u2019s revenue comes from 1% of customers. If the global economy craters, multi-millionaires are still going to buy clothing. They might not buy a $300,000 ferrari but they will still buy a $1000 pair of pants. \n\nPositions:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/s3ZHnnj](https://imgur.com/a/s3ZHnnj)\n\nFarfetch recent announcements referenced:\n\n[https://www.farfetchinvestors.com/financial-news/news-details/2020/Farfetch-Reports-Preliminary-Results-for-First-Quarter-2020/default.aspx](https://www.farfetchinvestors.com/financial-news/news-details/2020/Farfetch-Reports-Preliminary-Results-for-First-Quarter-2020/default.aspx)\n\n[https://www.farfetchinvestors.com/financial-news/news-details/2020/Letter-from-the-CEO-2020/default.aspx](https://www.farfetchinvestors.com/financial-news/news-details/2020/Letter-from-the-CEO-2020/default.aspx)", "created_utc": 1587663138.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6qyed/ftch_revenue_set_to_double_by_end_of_year/", "is_self": true}
