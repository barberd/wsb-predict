But I\u2019ve been searching the Internet and haven\u2019t seen any fucking reason why it\u2019s going up so fast. But if Tesla cars can be charged using BLNK ports then I can understand why people are investing in this shit stock. Can anyone here find an explanation other than the goddamn money printer as to why this stock is exploding? Anyways I\u2019m buying calls tomorrow because I\u2019m an idiot and feel some FOMO\n\n$7.50C 07/17", "created_utc": 1593466157.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hi99sc/why_is_blnk_mooning/", "is_self": true}
