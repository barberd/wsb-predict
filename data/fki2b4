{"id": "fki2b4", "title": "EWP DD", "selftext": "\n\n \n\nSPAIN (EWP) ( Not as detailed in the macroeconomics because you cant get options for further out than 7 months so make do )\n\nSpain is a country in the EU. Proper shit, you know. But we aren\u2019t here to talk about Spain and how the EU is shit. We are just hear to talk about Spain and form an opinion at the end \u2013 I don\u2019t have one yet so hopefully this DD let\u2019s me form an opinion on Spain. So let\u2019s begin:\n\nSpain has a GDP of 1.4 trillion dollars. It\u2019s GDP per capita is around 30k. The ETF relevant for Spain is EWP. Currently trading at 19.xx, I have no clue on its outlook yet. The economy of Spain is varied and \u2018capitalist\u2019. Spain is currently under a lockdown and has a bleak outlook. This will be referenced later.\n\nLet\u2019s continue with the economy: Spain\u2019s economy is built on tourism, energy, automotive manufacturing and agribusiness. Well, the Chinese Virus fucked up tourism both domestic and foreign. Tourism makes up around 5% of the economy but tourism makes up less than 5% of the ETF. The company is called Amadeus IT.\n\nETF Holdings: (in order of weighting)\n\n1. Iberdrola is a Spanish multinational electric utility company\n2. Banco Santander, S.A., doing business as Santander Group, is a Spanish multinational commercial bank and financial services company\n3. Industria de Dise\u00f1o Textil, S.A. is a Spanish multinational clothing company\n4. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A., better known by its initialism BBVA, is a Spanish multinational financial services company\n5. Cellnex Telecom is a Spanish wireless telecommunications infrastructure and services company with a projected portfolio of up to 53,000 locations across Europe .\n6. Ferrovial, S.A., previously Grupo Ferrovial, is a Spanish multinational company involved in the design, construction, financing, operation and maintenance of transport infrastructure and urban services.\n7. Amadeus IT Group, S.A. is a major Spanish IT provider for the global travel and tourism business.\n8. Telef\u00f3nica, S.A. is a Spanish multinational telecommunications company. It is one of the largest telecommunication companies in the world.\n9. Grifols, S.A. is a Spanish multinational pharmaceutical and chemical manufacturer.\n10. Repsol S.A. is a fossil fuel company and it is vertically integrated and operates in all areas of the oil and gas industry, including exploration and production, refining, distribution and marketing, petrochemicals, power generation and trading.\n\nNow since YTD, EWP has been down 33.2% while SPY has been down 22.18%.\n\nThis is how much each company in the ETF has also lost since YTD.\n\n1. IBE \u2013 down 1.17% but 18% since ATH in Feb before the crash\n2. SAN \u2013 down 43% YTD\n3. ITX \u2013 down 33%\n4. BVA \u2013 down 44%\n5. CLNX \u2013 up 1.19% and down 19% since ATH in Feb before the crash\n6. FER \u2013 down 27.89%\n7. AMS down 35.52%\n8. TEf down 31.31%\n9. GRF down 14.38% YTD and down 20.59% from ATH in Feb\n10. REP down 51.898%\n\nSITREP:\n\nSpain is currently under lockdown, they have locked down the entire nation. It was a rapid and sudden response meaning many people in their houses don\u2019t have essentials so the government has seized the means of production to \u2018ensure\u2019 food gets to the people. Private hospitals were seized for their beds and other facilities.\n\nAccording to John McAfee, the country is under total lockdown and people are being fined for ignoring the measures. The transport minister has said that the lockdown will be longer than 15 days,( [https://euobserver.com/coronavirus/147763](https://euobserver.com/coronavirus/147763))\n\nI assume they will go into April\u2019s 2nd week as the country is still not at a peak. Here\u2019s a graph on the cases and deaths:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/nFYODZ8](https://imgur.com/a/nFYODZ8)\n\nSpain\u2019s cases are still rapidly increasing and with this rate of growth \u2013 there should be 18000 cases by the end of the week and about 700 deaths. The lockdown will damage the Spanish economy in the long term and of course short term.\n\nNow for the strikes and dates,\n\nThe ETF is currently trading at 19.55. There are 3 realistic exp dates: 4/17, 7/17 and 10/17. Clearly the volume is low asf.\n\nI believe spain like the rest of the world is heading for a recession so puts for either 7/17 or 10/17 is the way to go. Strike for 17/18.\n\nDisclaimer: I don\u2019t own any and don\u2019t plan on. I like my early EWJ puts and will be keeping them and have no", "created_utc": 1584498395.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fki2b4/ewp_dd/", "is_self": true}
