{"id": "g18t6o", "title": "ZM DD - Coming Implosion", "selftext": "So pre-market chatting with u/Kramnet about Zoom and how it is totally going against all logic sparked this DD.  In the chat, we theorized if roughly 1% of the 200m to 400m new users bought premium, that ZM would skyrocket.  This set me out to see if that would really cause a skyrocket.  For all assumptions, I am going to take a best scenario approach. In march they said that about 200M people are using it (and not all of these can be new).  Plus, the CFO has been saying that most of the uptick in usage is in the free version. However, we will still take everything at best approach:\n\nWe'll take the high side - 4,000,000\n\nCost per month - $15\n\nNew Revenue Added - $180M\n\nPrevious Q Rev - $188.3M = Q1FY20 Revenue - $368.3M\n\nN/I - holding GP at 81.5% (consistent 2019 & 2018), and then increasing everything else (marketing, G&A, etc.) by only 33% (compared to 100% revenue growth) - $108M Quarterly N/I. Probably way way high as Q4 N/I was $12.2M. (ZM has been doubling revenue annual the past 3 years, to double revenue in a quarter is a aggressive, but possible). If I was really guessing - N/I would be more around $30 -40M.\n\nShares - Basic - 233.6M / Diluted - 254.3M\n\nEPS for the Q - 0.45 / Annualized PE 175 / PEG Over 6 with a 50% growth even after that. This is astronomical and someday we will wake up and see that nobody wants that.\n\nPositions - 145/155 call credit spreads. one 5/15 100P (bagholding). Will enter 110p 8/20 when we hit $150, or by end of week.", "created_utc": 1586882008.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g18t6o/zm_dd_coming_implosion/", "is_self": true}
