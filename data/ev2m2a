What the fuck is that? Who would unironically invest long term in these companies at current valuations? I am confident I can make higher returns selling my bathwater to the same ultra niche market over the next 10 years brought to present value INCLUDING a motherfucking small business discount rate than new Amazon investors will make in the next 20 years compounded. What, you think amzns gonna pay dividends anytime soon? Foh bitch boi\n\nSeriously, it's obscene. Not because I don't believe in these companies and their potential but because the last 5 years go against all fucking logic n yet we're still out here making money longing TSLA and AMZN and shorting the fucking VIX. There's socioeconomic instability brewing around the world. people are sick and tired of whatever the fuck this shit is and trump is gonna win 2020. China is femdomming AI and US kids want to become youtubers. And you wanna long Netflix? At a fucking 52x p/e?? Mate \n\nI mean I guess that we've turned binge watching into a digital addiction to the point where it became another inelastic good us fucks won't be able to ditch once recession kicks us newbies out the door like your momma did with American Spirits and keystone light during the 89 crash. You know what I changed my mind it's long NFLX\n\nBut still. What are you doing that is of value to society? Is your work even valuable? Ion mean like \"you help the children?\" Valuable I mean like do you feel irreplaceable? MOST people don't cause shits getting Crazy. You can be clipped and replaced in a minute by a either a younger dude who'll accept lower pay because of desperation or a machine who buttfuxks you at making shitty pivot tables? \n\nThis shit makes no sense but with this in mind consider what the future is going to look like beyond cashing in tendies from speculating on \"pre-profit\" public companies. \n\nBtw I'm long most stocks I mentioned so haha", "created_utc": 1580198366, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ev2m2a/coming_down_3_adderall_the_reconning_is_near_dd/", "is_self": true}
