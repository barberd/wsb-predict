Over in r/investing a guy went to invest with them and they only were told about diversification and ETF options. \n\nFirst hand witness said:\n\n&gt; I love Schwab...we even went in for a portfolio review, and rather than try to sell us a bunch of Schwab products, the guy mostly talked about age appropriate diversification and ETF options.\n\nThat\u2019s the problem with Schwab... they want you to be poor. They won\u2019t ever tell you about deep OTM calls, FD\u2019s or recursive call selling to create infinite leverage within your Personal Risk Tolerance.\n\nDid you ever hear the tragedy of Darth RobinHood the Wise?\n\nI thought not. It's not a story the Schwab would tell you. It's a WSB legend. Darth RobinHood was a Dark Lord of Leverage, so powerful and so wise he would let you use 2k to sell ITM covered calls to create infinite leverage\u2026 He had such a knowledge of the dark side, he could even keep the ones he cared about from paying commission on OTM FD option trading.\n\nHe became so powerful\u2026 the only thing he was afraid of was AAPL earnings report being positive, which eventually, of course, they were. Unfortunately, he taught WSB everything he knew, then his apprentices mocked him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from commission, but not himself from the SEC.", "created_utc": 1572993637, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ds6vg5/dont_invest_with_schwab_dd/", "is_self": true}
