{"id": "gflo8a", "title": "Unusual Options, The OCRRBTT Method, or How Not to Get GUH'D by $NYT Again.", "selftext": "So after the disaster that was the NYT trade (I lost 1.2K right at opening and the next 300 as the price shot up), I did some soul searching and I reviewed with my team. What exactly had gone wrong? After reviewing the data I went back to square one, and I remembered when I first learned about the OCRRBTT. I had made some blatant errors in my analysis and overlooked some incredibly important factors. So, I adjusted my strategy and I'm on to the next trade. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe thing that I had royally fucked up on was charting and the trend, I forgot the number one rule: INSTITUTIONS USUALLY ARE TREND FOLLOWERS. The NYT play was completely against the trend, and if I had bought calls instead we would've all had 4 baggers at least. In fact, based on Ichimoku analysis, it was a clear sign for a bullish breakout, not to mention the fat dark pool prints that occurred throughout the day. I had gotten overconfident and ignored clear signs that this trade was a hedge. Shoutout to the retards that caught my mistake in realtime. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I decided to go back to the basics, and  I thought I would share the OG method of analyzing UOA before entering a trade. \n\n \n\nThe OCRRBTT system is a way to trade unusual options with maximum confidence and minimum risk. Coined by Andrew Keene, a former prop trader on the CBOE, it stands for Open Interest, Chart, Risk, Reward, Breakeven, Time, and Target. Every trader who enters a trade based on unusual options activity should do a quick run through of the following:\n\n**Open Interest:** Compare Volume with Open Interest. Only enter a trade if volume is significantly greater than open interest to ensure the order flow is indeed opening trades.\n\n**Chart:** What is the trend? Bullish? Bearish? Institutions trade with the trend, so if the chart points in a different direction than the option activity, proceed with caution. For example, the SNAP play gapped up after a period of slowly rising, and the trade was profitable. Meanwhile, r/wallstreetbets all got GUH\u2019D when we bought puts on NYT, which was against the bullish trend being established for the past few weeks. \n\n**Risk:** I'm skipping this section because I know you autists are willing to accept any level of max pain for even the slightest chance of profit. \n\n**Reward:** Make sure to understand what return you can expect to get with the trade. This will give you a realistic target to aim for and prevent diamond-handing gains into losses.\n\n**Breakeven:** Where does this stock need to move in order for your option to either break even or be ITM at expiration? Understand how this stock usually moves and don\u2019t enter a trade where you think the option will expire OTM. \n\n**Time:** What is the timeframe that you expect to be in this trade? Unusual option trades generally pan out in 1-10 trading days, although some have taken as long as 3 weeks. The chances of success fall drastically after 10 trading days and the risk begins to build up. \n\n**Target:** What is your target profit? What is your exit strategy? Will you lock in profit or take off half? Have a preplanned exit strategy and always take partial profit once you hit your target. \n\nIf a trader reviews all of these rules, it is much easier to manage a position and will ensure that risks are hedged and accounted for. A good trader thinks how much they could make. A great trader knows how much he can lose. The greatest traders full yolo into eternal glory, win or lose.\n\n**TL,DR;** My guy did you need pictures?
