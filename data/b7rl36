{"id": "b7rl36", "title": "Where are your calls on InfoSys ($INFY)?", "selftext": "***FORUM NOTE -- Feel free to leave feedback/additions to this DD. I don't do it often, and I slapped this together quick for further discussion.***  \n\n\nLet's talk about Indian-based InfoSys ($INFY). For those that don't know, InfoSys is *\"a consulting, technology and outsourcing company, which provides end-to-end business solutions thereby enabling clients to enhance business performance.\"*  \n\n\nIn other words, InfoSys's bread-and-butter is that the company gets your company the Indian customer service reps to be your customer service reps so your customers get annoyed that they have to repeat 5 times the same problem they had with your product before you can actually get some help. But InfoSys is expanding to become much more than that, and recent acquisitions or partnerships shows:  \n\n\n1) [Purchased a 75% stake in ABN AMRO that deals in mortgage servicing.](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/ites/infosys-to-buy-abn-amros-mortgage-service-unit/articleshow/68623564.cms) Since Sept 2018, this is the third type of purchase its made, turning INFY into an aggressive stance than before.\n\n2) [In early March, InfoSys locked in a \"long term, strategic partnership\" with Rolls Royce to provide them with engineering and IT professionals.](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/infosys-to-deliver-digital-services-to-rolls-royce/articleshow/68305720.cms)\n\n3) [InfoSys locked in a three-year strategic IT partnership with the French Open.](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/infosys-announces-3-year-pact-with-roland-garros/articleshow/68516818.cms)  \n\n\nAdditionally, InfoSys seems to be making strides and investments in the AI sector as well. This makes sense given the natural transition away from human interaction with customer service to AI-generated support that is much less costly and can be more effective.\n\nSince Dec 31, the stock is up 16%, but has essentially been trading sideways since Feb. 1 at around 10.50/10.75. P/E ratio is around 29, given their aggressive growth. But as you consider how InfoSys continues to be a dominate player in India industrial expertise to the rest of the developed world, they are seen as the leader in this arena.\n\nINFY reports earnings on April 12, the same time JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, and PNC do. And earnings are expected to be up at .13, but given their aggressive growth going forward, can easily see them beating estimates. Furthermore, if were to play calls on INFY, recommend $11 or $11.5 calls for April 18 expiry.   \n\n\n*NOTE -- INFY has not broken through the $11 resistance mark, but this could be their time.*  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "created_utc": 1554060309, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b7rl36/where_are_your_calls_on_infosys_infy/", "is_self": true}
