Both times the news came out I ignored it instead of buying calls or shares of FIT. I got the notification google MIGHT buy them, read it, then went back to my other plays I was worrying about. Then today I got the news google WILL buy them and I learned my lesson and went to check FIT stock. It wasn't moving so I assumed the MIGHT news priced in the WILL news, so didn't buy it. Went back to sleep and when I woke up it was up about 15%. Now WILL news came out premarket so I couldn't buy calls but going all in on shares could have been like 5k gain.\n\nSo always pay attention to ALL notifications and act!", "created_utc": 1572641439, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dqa6pu/regret_of_the_week_maybe_start_a_new_weekly_thread/", "is_self": true}
