I have learned so much from many great minds on this site. But now, I believe there is a strong lack of morale, faith, enthusiasm in this community. \n\n**Technical Analysis (crayons and pretty lines)**\n\nNow, I have heard all the negatives about TA and how it\u2019s just voodoo bullshit, I agree. Did you know the majority of day traders lose money? Well I sure did, cause I lost pretty much my whole account (multiple times). Again, why am I telling you all this? Because every single time I lose, I refuse to give up. Take your losses as learning opportunities, but actually learn from them. Back to the TA, let\u2019s get into Fibonacci retracements. \n\n[1929](https://gyazo.com/307684e224c5ba48a8e9ffddebf57f33) Fib retracement reversal at 50%\n\n[1987](https://gyazo.com/e155d2f4aa6c796ee7d72857b13c4d54) Fib retracement reversal at 61.8%\n\n[2008](https://gyazo.com/10f30a92d2ca9b54b4f01ad9735a0dbd) Fib retracement reversal in between 50% and 61.8%\n\nThe big question? Where are we now?\n\n[2020](https://gyazo.com/3ac5509ea5f2c43475edbb400f18be0c) Fib retracement is close / at 50% which is 2780 roughly. \n\n61.8% is 2930 roughly. \n\nSPX is currently at 2750, we are close to testing the reversal levels. With volatility picking up, we will start swinging and I believe circuit breakers will come back as well. \n\nThis is why I dislike the lack of morale and the giving up of faith in the community. We are close to the reversal, but some of you want to give up now? The drop will come, maybe not tomorrow, maybe not Monday. But it will happen, sooner than later, tuck your 5/15 puts in.", "created_utc": 1586395721.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxj8jf/why_the_drop_will_happen_read_this_to_feel_better/", "is_self": true}
