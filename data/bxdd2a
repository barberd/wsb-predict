To those of you who don't know me, let me introduce myself. Hi I'm mike.\n\nIt may seem like a sudden shock to suddenly lose $2600. But in fact it has been an enormous blessing. I am able to spend more time with the family and do things like gardening, or making some toast in the bathtub, or slowly sharpening every knife in the house while staring intently at my wrists. I've also been practicing loading and reloading my gun so I'll be ready in case of self-defense. Another fun fact is that my head fits perfectly in the Ninja Pro blender I got with the anticipation of making oat milk to go with my GME tendies.\n\nI'm taking the liberty of deleting Robinhood, and hitting the gym. That was long overdue. Turns out paying $6.50 per trade is worth it so you put a little more thought before making a series of retarded impulse buys. \n\nThanks for listening to my story (FYI based on my most recent DD, GME is currently the most undervalued it has ever been, long GME)", "created_utc": 1559802095, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bxdd2a/why_losing_2600_playing_gme_earnings_was_the_best/", "is_self": true}
