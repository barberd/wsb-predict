I'm not even going to tell you it's a good company, or that anything [this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bg2r34/tsla_stock_this_morning/elhxjmk?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) said is wrong. Honestly I'd put RAD and gamestop in my retirement account before Tesla.\n\nAll I will say is that for the last two years, Tesla has erratically bounced between $260 and $380 based primarily on memes. Generally speaking, hype takes it soaring, and a whiff of reality brings it crashing back down, but never for long. For the last year (since the robinhood tracker was created), autists on Robinhood have nearly perfectly capitalized on this pattern by buying every dip and selling every pop, and they're predicting a bigger move than ever. \n\nhttps://robintrack.net/symbol/TSLA\n\n(Note: I'm flairing this as technical since I'm effectively using this single graph for my entire thesis)\n\nThe graphs are highly inversely correlated, meaning robinhood swing traders are making a killing, and more of them own the stock now than ever. They are expecting this dip to be just another dip like all of the others, and yeah it could be the final dippening, or it could be just like every other fucking time. Do you honestly think Elon is out of tricks? This man will do anything to keep that shit bouncing around. His ego depends on it and last time I checked he still was a billionare, still had a twitter account with millions of followers, and is still the same goddamn person he ever was. Time isn't after us. \n\nBTFD.", "created_utc": 1555964956, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bg6yrh/autists_are_buying_tsla_are_you/", "is_self": true}
