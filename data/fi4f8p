But one of the ones that has caught my eye that hasn't really been talked about is Planet fitness or other fitness centers. Most of us have puts out the wazoo on Cruises, Airlines, and other hospitality buisnesses but I believe Planet fitness is also ripe for the plunge. \n\nAs of right now it is down only 12.5% this week, and 38.8% this month. While compared to Hyatt it is on similar drop rates (-16%/-38%), but compared Six flags (-30%/-65%) and Seaworld (-44%/-70%) it is lagging behind. \n\nI would also argue that once the US population starts to finially wrap their heads around avoiding public places is a good idea that one of the first places to be called out will be gyms and fitness centers -especially when you can still work out at home. What are your thoughts\n\nI have added put and put spreads on PLNT to Diversify my bets. $50p 3/20, $50/$47.5ps 3/20 looking to capitalize on its upswing today and probably drop this next week as the fear spreads.", "created_utc": 1584124602.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fi4f8p/planet_fitness_lagging_the_drop/", "is_self": true}
