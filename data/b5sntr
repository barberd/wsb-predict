I want to move towards value stocks with high dividends for boring compounding interest tendies so I can safely reinvest them into FDs. \n\nI personally believe that 5G is the future and stocks like VZ and T are a nice long term play considering their high dividends. Frankly, I do not know much about the intricacies of the science/technology behind 5G and which stocks I should be looking at. VZ is pushing that they are first movers in 5G, but it looks like that may not be the case. Any insight is appreciated.
