Facebook views the sale process as complete and doesn't plan to bid again now that Google has agreed to the purchase, one of the people said. \n\n&gt; According to the filing, Fitbit CEO James Park had dinner with \"the chief executive officer of Party A\" on June 11, 2019, to discuss the wearables technology landscape. That person would be Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, sources said. Park and other members of Fitbit's senior management had dinner with Zuckerberg again on July 2, the filing said.
