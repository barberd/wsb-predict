Universal studios will be closing thru mid April (the theme park currently brings in about 9.2 million/day in revenue. \n\n2. more people watching / streaming content / working form home actually just means more strain and effor from comcast to keep up their supple (more man power and more physical IT infrastructure). \n\n3. No NBCsports content / basically a dead channel and medium for the coming months. \n\n4. Studios have already started announcing movie delays (Fast furious 9 + more) as this becomes the new norm, no new content will be coming from the studio for a while. \n\nGet your pocketbooks ready boys.", "created_utc": 1584071603.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhtm9t/new_autist_here_heres_my_take_on_another_great/", "is_self": true}
