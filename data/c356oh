{"id": "c356oh", "title": "Robinhood fills vs. Tastyworks commission", "selftext": "Basically I'm sick and tired of how options work on robinhood. Pretty much any time I go to buy or sell an option, as it's processing the transaction, the price of the option changes to over or undercut me so that I then have to replace the order. This isn't happening once or twice, it's every single trade. Sometimes you gotta move in on a play quickly, that really isn't possible on RH. You can find me mouthing off my phone or computer early in the morning before I have the patience for robinhood's crappy nonsense. When you've been up all night watching futures tick between a 1 and 2 point move you really cant be bothered to endure such a shit options trading experience. What I do now is have my computer to make trades and then my phone next to me ready to replace that order and stoop to a worse price on every trade just to get it to go through. I've been considering switching to tastyworks or tdameritrade for a while now but I have a smaller account size so I'm not sure it's worth it cause of the commissions. I'm trying to weigh the money i lose due to robinhood's crappy fills and just overall shittyness vs the money i will lose with other brokers that have commissions. Should I continue to endure RH or is it time to switch? Have any of you made the switch and how has it been going for you? Why do you prefer RH or a different broker?", "created_utc": 1561085593, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c356oh/robinhood_fills_vs_tastyworks_commission/", "is_self": true}
