Since I'm one of the only idiots on here with a real job, I figured I'd share some of industry data with you all so we can have some real DD in here. I'm in hotel development so most of my information will showcase near-term and speculative long-term impacts on the hotel industry and real estate capital markets. \n\nEarly data from the China Hotel market provided a glimpse into the potential impact that bat virus would have on hotel markets around the world. By mid-January, roughly 30 days after the initial viral outbreak in Wuhan, the China hotel market was operating at approximately 70% occupancy. Within two weeks, domestic and international travel restrictions and a growing international awareness to the potential damage of COVID-19 had decimated the hotel market. Reports gathered on January 26 showcased a 75% drop in occupancy to 17% for the period. \n\nFast-forward to March 30 and we\u2019re able to more accurately quantify the impact beer flu is having on the US hotel market. STR\u2019s most recent release on March 25, 20201 provides a glimpse at the initial damage done to the markets:  \n\n* Occupancy down -56.4% to 30.3%, \n* Average Daily Rate down -30.2% to US$93.41, and \n* RevPAR down -69.5% to US$28.32.  \n\nTo put this in perspective, the declines are worse than both 9/11 and the financial crisis of 2007\u201308. \n\nNow here's where things get really fucking interesting. According to Trepp LLC, the U.S. Hotel industry held approximately $300B of mortgage debt as of third quarter 2019. This was up 7.8% from a year earlier and 14.2% from two years earlier. While most hotels have operating reserves to last multiple months of revenue decline, very few are capitalized to survive multiple consecutive months at zero or near-zero revenue. While state and federal disaster relief programs may extend this runway, timing for relief capital injection and duration of closure have the potential to tip the scales towards cascading defaults throughout the markets. And with current delinquent trends (1.33% of hotel loans being delinquent as of Q3 2019), this thing is about to  blow like your mom at the corner truck stop now that she's lost her geriatric travel agency job. \n\nAnd as a popped cherry on top, the latest industry estimate is $5-8 trillion total loss for Q1-Q3 2020. ONE FUCKING INDUSTRY. \n\nTL;DR  6/19 SPY 180p", "created_utc": 1585761263.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ft3wks/impact_on_the_hotel_industry/", "is_self": true}
