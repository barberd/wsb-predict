Wuhan Buffet increased his stake to just under $800 million in Q4 of 2019 and no one is talking about it. After doing a little more research I found out Wutang Buffett loaned this company $10 billion recently to acquire some other oil company which is good, blah blah blah. Anyways OXY has increased their EPS every year since 2015 and their stock is down 50% since then. For TA autists, their chart looks like it's bottoming out, RSI is touched 30 for the first time in years, and the last time volume was this high was in 2009 when they jumped from $50 to $100 over the next couple years. Not to be a boomer but I think this energy stock might be a good play for LEAPS or a longer term play. Earnings call on the 28th might be good too though. What you retards think? Oil to the \ud83c\udf1a? (I already have SPCE calls)", "created_utc": 1581904917, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f519z1/oxy/", "is_self": true}
