Over the past month or so I am down almost 70% with their money. I don\u2019t know what to do. I am trying to decide whether I should put the rest in some different options and hope for the best or just tell them what happened. I know they will be upset if I tell them. Thankfully they haven\u2019t checked the balances since I started but I am also worried about that. \n\nI am down too much to be able to make it back in any reasonable time with regular long term investments like index funds/ETFs. I have to play options to make this back quick. I have about 40k left in the account when including current positions. I currently am holding SPY puts and CHWY calls. I am planning on selling them at open tomorrow and kind of resetting. What options should I buy to make it back? Once I make it back I will invest in index funds and ETFs for long term so I don\u2019t get in this situation again. I just wanted to make them a lot of money fast. I want a bigger bedroom in the basement and if I made them money they would be able to afford a better house. \n\n[Here is the screenshot of my parent\u2019s account balance](https://imgur.com/a/9ipAMbK)", "created_utc": 1590536906.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gr8jbo/parents_let_me_trade_with_their_money/", "is_self": true}
