(Granted AYTU was overhyped longer than any other ticker and people were thinking of making it the SUB logo)\n\nIt's especialy interesting since the interest dropped before congress passing the chinese exchange law and before the full brunt of Luckin Coffee as well iirc.", "created_utc": 1592931205.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hei921/so_what_happened_to_the_massive_swarm_of_huya/", "is_self": true}
