Mostly just AyyMD, TQQQ, SQQQ, whatever.\n\nToday something funny has happend. I cancelled a sell order to move my stop-loss up on SQQQ, all went fine, but the cancelation didn't make it through due to some technical glitch. So there was a sell order set but i had no way of knowing that. Once I've finally sold my position, the sell order I wanted to cancel went through, too.\n\nThat resulted in an unwanted short sale of 555 SQQQ's at around 33 USD, and there may be more to come.\n\nThing is \u2013 I'm such a pussy that I have no margin and my broker doesn't even allow for shorting SQQQ.\n\nWhat would happen if I din't tell them about it?
