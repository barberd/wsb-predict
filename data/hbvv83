{"id": "hbvv83", "title": "No need for DD, Follow Wallstreet Bets Idiots in Realtime with Tendies Tracker", "selftext": "[Tendies Tracker - Track Wallstreet Bets Sentiment and Price](http://tendiestracker.com/)\n\n**Didn't you post this before?**\n\nYes, and it was hugged to death. I have made some changes and stress tested it, and I think it made some amount of difference. This is largely a side project from my real job to keep me busy during COVID, and I am footing the server bill. If it dies again, sorry!\n\n**What is Tendies Tracker?**\n\n[Tendies Tracker - SPY Charts](http://tendiestracker.com/chart/spy)\n\n[Tendies Tracker - ZM Charts](http://tendiestracker.com/chart/zm) \n\nJust to make it clear - you can search in the top left or on the chart page for other stocks (eg, FB, MSFT).\n\nTendies Tracker allows you to search for a stock and see how Reddit Sentiment has changed over time for that stock as compared to price. Right now, price is not included in the charts because getting load times low enough to get realtime stock data for all \\~8k supported stocks is just not feasible for a free project. I'll gladly add the feature back if Adsense approves my account / I get some Patreon supporters.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zr35pizw9t551.png?width=1236&format=png&auto=webp&s=74384c93e45a22b0dd765619d856c50390df4815\n\nLet me explain the screenshot above. In the past three days (**3d** time period), aggregated to one hour candles (**1h**), SPY price has gone from \\~320 -> \\~305. However, you can see spike in the number of negative SPY sentiment on WSB preceding almost every dip in SPY.\n\nYou can search for another stock, change the candle size or time period, and also view the latest comments and stock price data.\n\n**Why would I use Tendies Tracker?**\n\nSee if other idiots agree with you in aggregate (via the charts) or just view recent comments.\n\n**We produce a Stock Mention Leaderboard**\n\n[Tendies Tracker - Top Mentioned stocks on WSB](http://tendiestracker.com/top_mentions)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/03xczim4at551.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfaf506fca682ce7c18421f4644bf9994ca5daf5\n\n**We also produce a Trending Stocks Leaderboard**\n\n[Top Trending Stocks on Wallstreet Bets - Tendies Tracker](http://tendiestracker.com/trending)\n\nTrending shows stocks that are showing a recent trend upwards. However, this is currently not a public feature because the query takes too long and it will slow the current server down if too many people load it. For context, this screenshot was taken at \\~10:07 EST on 6/12.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hg69net6at551.png?width=1896&format=png&auto=webp&s=58ba5e90b98dfa036351fc73436648615fcb67da\n\n**Why does this exist?**\n\nI have been following Wallstreet Bets for the past few months, and some of the stuff that I have seen members post here is actually really impressive. WSB has called the rise and fall of many stocks before it happened. Because of that, I made a bot that scrapes this subreddit to download all comments here. It uses natural language processing and data mining to figure out what stocks are being mentioned, whether it is positive or negative, and then track how this has changed over time. Initially, I used it to make a ML bot that predicts buys and sells. This actually worked pretty well, but I found out one thing pretty fast: **I am a shitty trader, but a good programmer**. Even when my predictions were right, I would FOMO out of my position ten minutes before the stock turned. Because of that, I refocused with a plan of visualizing the data, and here we are. For people who are at least an average trader, I hope this can help you.\n\n**I want access to raw data for ML Models/So on**\n\nPM me and I can see how much work it will be to provide what you want.\n\n**There are some stupid stocks on the leaderboard**\n\nYup. I am not going to sift through all 8k stocks to pick the ones that people might use a lot in other contexts.\n\n**This is not interesting in non-trading hours. Can I backtest?**\n\nYup, if I can get ad-supported.\n\n**Why is this free?**\n\nBecause in its current state, I should be able to support a reasonable number of users at the same time without it costing too much. I want to use Adsense, but I need visitors and links from other sites for them to approve my account. Here is a link, and come be a user.\n\n**Your site crashed/is slow/has an error**\n\nThis is a simple python webserver which has not been tuned to many people doing crazy things. I honestly have no experience with scaling a webapp, so I would be more surprised if I do not crash.\n\n**Please consider supporting me one way or another if you like the project**\n\nIf many people use this site, it becomes expensive to maintain. I want to add more features if people like the site, but right now I am basically maxed out on what my server can do, and I will honestly not be surprised if you hug-of-death the website right now. I want to serve ads, but Adsense will not approve me without links. You can support me multiple ways: share this site, donate, or offer feedback.
