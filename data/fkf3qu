It was my first time trading in almost 6 months and had good gains. Currently holding $5k and converted everything to SPDR Gold Trust. Hopefully, I can make another good trade this week, I think I was lucky this time though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: People were asking about my trade history. Here's my trade history for today, in ascending order (new to old).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/chtoxfhgfbn41.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4adbb678f7daf8a334074a65b78a1a1a135d5aa\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xuw6v9tgfbn41.png?width=527&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1502341ce8cba575615e7842bc2e26a9a55c93f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0c8zyb6hfbn41.png?width=533&format=png&auto=webp&s=9414918dda254ffcef0c01ada310e355e5c6a61b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/556b43wtgbn41.png?width=271&format=png&auto=webp&s=8907dc05f861d5bbc0deeb9a60c4e6ea65395105\n\nEDIT #2: Most of my gains came from early morning at 9:40 AM weekly calls @ sold it exactly at 12 PM. I converted all my positions to 2-weeks puts, thinking it was up way too much for the day (as you can see on my trading history). I just went with gut feelings, no technical analysis. I have been watching the market for a long time though.", "created_utc": 1584486466.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkf3qu/570_gains_today_5k_to_35k/", "is_self": true}
