Paid about $150 for both trades (they were only 1 contract each, not the standard 10) on thinkorswim.   \n\n\nStrike price barely moved that week, I thought I was out 150. Logged back in today to find my account liquidating value is more than double than when I started, from 1k starting to over 2k now.   \n\n\nAlso, forgot to close down the trade. I thought that options expired worthless automatically if they didn't reach the strike price?? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust called the broker and asked him to close the trade, which will go through Monday morning. Felt too embarrassed to ask him wtf happened so I'm asking you guys.   \n\n\nTl;Dr: I'm retarded, thought I lost $150 on buying out of the money options only to find my account has more than doubled.
