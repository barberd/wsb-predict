Let's call that sequel BatFlu Returns, starring JeromeP as Max Schreck.\n\nI thought I'd make a simple tally and central stop for Chinese Virus stats.  Lately I've just been checking the NYT's account of states where cases are increasing, \\~same or decreasing and keeping a simple record.  I'll just do it here, maybe add other pertinent info as needed and it might end up useful for some folks.\n\n^(At the very least, I'm sure  one of you will end up fapping to this bc you're a sick fuck; you're welcome.)\n\nThe below shows the number of U.S. states (with 3 additional jurisdictions: PR, D.C. and Guam) in each bin.  Data normally taken a little before market open.\n\n|Date|Increasing|Same|Decreasing|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|5/2|19|20|14|\n|5/5|21|18|14|\n|5/6|23|14|16|\n|5/7|22|15|16|\n|5/8|25|13|15|\n\nN.B.: [NYT uses a 7-day average](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html).
