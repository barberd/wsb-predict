I ran across it a couple months ago and was hoping for a larger dump, but here we are. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR, MDA decided to buy all the satellite imaging companies of note (except vsat) but some boomer did some stupid shit in regards to allocating resources to production which shouldn't have been allocated there. They shit-canned the boomer, and brought in a director from DigitalGlobe (next time you see a satellite image on a news program, hit pause and look at who the image is courtesy of) and this dude went in aggressive. Massive layoffs, shopped the IP, then realized there are too many interested parties to actually sell it, so pulled a \"gfy, this is mine now\" and kept firing pikers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt some point, they lost a satellite, which has been a source of fantastic FUD as it was anywhere from an $85M to $155M satellite according to differing reports. The part of that story people seem to have missed is that it was insured for $183M. Bottom line: take a look at this chart and tell me your instinct isn't the same as mine. I'm in from 3.87-4.40 and planning to add, but feel free to bring me up to speed as to how this company ends up dying a slow death from here. April 18th  expirations are done and there's close to no options volume as of now, which are slightly put-heavy, but if you're as bullish on governments wanting to be able to peek inside your bathroom window to be able to know what brand of toilet paper you buy, your reaction is likely similar to mine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/s5pz19j0uot21.png\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, I'd love to hear from \"the voice of reason\" as to why this isn't one of the most attractive setups rn. Break outside of the channel, wouldn't be surprised to see a final push down, but the upside seems unreal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/flkew51ltot21.png", "created_utc": 1555883272, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bfu2rp/can_we_talk_about_maxr_for_a_second/", "is_self": true}
