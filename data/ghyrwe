This time last year we were at 50-year lows, in three months we managed to wipe out all the job gains of the last decade and then some! \n\n  Over in the UK, economic activity has started to reaccelerate. This reacceleration should not be mistaken for a new boom in economic growth. I think investors/traders should brace themselves for persistently disappointing data points over the next 1-3 months. If we were at 100 pre-virus which we weren\u2019t), The US and UK economies are going to undergo a transition; from total shut down, i.e., 0, to 1, then 2,3,4,5, and so on till we get to 100. It is quite improbable that we go from 0 to 100 in the second quarter. Trust me, homies, we are going to be on some chill s\\*&%.\n\n***Riding into the danger zone:*** **Bankruptcies Rising**\n\n  Investor consensus and policymakers alike keep expecting consumers and businesses bounce back as a function of an  \u201cincrease in pent up demand'' that has been cultivated as a result of being locked away for a month. The data so far fails to confirm this. Below is an extract from a Bloomberg;\n\n*\u201c****Some 42% of American non-financial public companies are discussing slashing investments, 27% are talking about \\[cutting\\] equity payouts and 17% are focused on drawing down on credit lines, conclude economists Andrew Y. Chen and Jie Yang. At the peak of the last recession, the figures were 25%, 11%, and 7%, respectively.\u201d***  \n\n   Businesses are ridding in the danger zone, and bankruptcies are rising.\n\nYou see, rising bankruptcies create a vicious circle. As bankruptcies rise, banks become concerned that their loan books will become worthless. This forces banks to reduce lending, thus reducing credit available to businesses; this creates more bankruptcies, delinquencies, and layoffs. These unfortunate events reinforce banks' decision to reduce available credit even more. Credit/ lending collapses, creating a worsening economic outlook. Highly leverages industries, for example, the restaurants (more on this later) are very exposed here. \n\n**Tightening Lending Standards.**\n\nEarlier last week, the fed released the senior loan officer survey report to highlight a tightening in lending standards. Below is a summary of the report from Darius Dale @ Hedgeye:\n\n* **Net % Tightening Lending Standards for Large/Medium C&I Firms**: +4,150bps to 41.5% in APR \u2013 the highest reading since JAN \u201909 and fastest acceleration since APR \u201990\n* **Net % Tightening Lending Standards for Small C&I Firms**: +4,110bps to 39.7% in APR \u2013 the highest reading since APR \u201909 and fastest acceleration since APR \u201990\n* **Net % Increasing the Cost of Credit Lines** for Large/Medium C&I Firms: +4,200bps to 32.3% in APR \u2013 the highest reading since JUL \u201909 and fastest acceleration ever\n* **Net % Increasing the Cost of Credit Lines for Small C&I Firms**: +2,990bps to 25.4% in APR \u2013 the highest reading since OCT \u201909 and fastest acceleration ever\n* **Net % Increasing Credit Spreads Over Banks\u2019 Cost of Capital for Large/Medium C&I Firms**: +6,170bps to 40.9% in APR \u2013 the highest reading since JUL \u201909 and fastest acceleration since OCT \u201907 \n* **Net % Increasing Credit Spreads Over Banks\u2019 Cost of Capital for Small C&I Firms**: +4,050bps to 30.2% in APR \u2013 the highest reading since OCT \u201909 and fastest acceleration since OCT \u201907 \n* **Net % Tightening Loan Covenants for Large/Middle** C&I Firms: +4,020bps to 33.3% in APR \u2013 the highest reading since JUL \u201909 and fastest acceleration since APR \u201990\n* **Net % Tightening Loan Covenants for Small C&I Firms**: +2,570bps 24.2% in APR \u2013 the highest reading since JUL \u201909 and fastest acceleration since APR \u201909\n* **Net % Tightening Lending Standards for Consumer Credit Card Loans**: +2,490bps to 38.5% in APR \u2013 the highest reading since JUL \u201909 and most rapid acceleration since JUL \u201908\n* **Net % Tightening Lending Standards for Consumer New and Used Auto Loans**: +710bps to 16.0% in APR \u2013 highest reading ever\n* **Net % Tightening Lending Standards for Consumer Loans ex-Credit Cards and Autos**: +2,020bps to 21.8% in APR \u2013 the highest reading since JUL \u201909 and fastest acceleration since JUL \u201908\n\n**The Knock-on effects.**\n\nThe evidence above demonstrates that for businesses;\n\n1 ) The cost of credit is rising at a time where businesses need access to money,2\n\n2) Lending standards are increasing, further reducing access to credit. \n\n1+2= Rising probability of bankruptcy.\n\nFor consumers;\n\n1) High unemployment causes banks to perceive the consumer as a source of lending risk thereby making it difficult to obtain credit\n\n2) Lending standards for auto loans and credit cards are rising, decreasing the availability of credit for the consumption of consumer goods ( cars, phones, etc.). \n\n1+2= Rising probability of widespread solvency events. \n\n**Unique opportunities in Carvana**\n\nIf lending standards are tightening for auto loans, auto businesses like Carvana are likely likely to underperform. Buying put spreads makes sense. Buying November 2020 $80puts and selling the $70 puts should cost about $3 at the time of writing this with a $10 payoff. One could also sell short; however, patience should be exercised as it is on a bullish trend with a lot of short interest. Your balls could get squeezed shorting this bastard.\n\n**PRAA**\n\nDebt collectors love recessions. As delinquencies increase, they make more money as they get more business opportunities. These guys are ramping up the purchase of lousy loan books at a discount, an incredible tailwind for them going into 2022. Buy on any pullbacks.\n\n \n\n**Restaurants**\n\nThese guys are facing a severe decline in capacity. Parts of texas see 25% capacity, reduced foot traffic into full-service restaurants. However, the quick service restaurants seem to fair a lot better. I think star bucks falls into the category of restaurants who get hit with reduced capacity. Sell when lower highs are established. If needed, I will drop an alert when it gets to a level I think is an excellent place to sell. I'm not good with squiggly lines. \n\nUntil next time  ML peace", "created_utc": 1589238570.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghyrwe/danger_zoooowne/", "is_self": true}
