I know many of you are illiterate, but those of you with the ability to read should know by now that there has been some NOK buzz here on WSB. What do SPCE, TSLA, and MSFT all have in common? There is no reason that they should be worth more than 3.50, but due to the hype here at WSB they have gone to the moon.
