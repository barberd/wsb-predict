Service workers such as yourselves make very little money.\n\nThere\u2019s a 2.2 trillion stim bill that was passed. In the stim bill the unemployment for the next few months, these fucking people will be paid $600/week On top of their existing unemployment.\n\nPlus a $1200 check. Do the ducking math\n\nThe stim bill $600/week benefit is giving every morning $15/hr at 40 hrs a week PLUS their unemployment benefit. In California that ranges from $40-450/week. \n\nSo majority of these 6 mil retards that file for unemployment will find hey. They get more fucking money on unemployment than they did working. \n\nSo if they could pay their rents, car loans etc while they were working, why won\u2019t they with unemployment? Plus $1200 stim bill.\n\nThese poor people are gonna be flush with cash the next few months. There\u2019s not gonna be riots or whatever.\n\nHoly fuck u guys are dumb", "created_utc": 1585844764.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ftpcah/why_the_unemployment_numbers_dont_matter/", "is_self": true}
