If you followed the 50ma indicator and sold put credits spreads along that line, you probably had a good amount of profit for the year, nearly 70-100%. But that year the price reached a high of 2050 twice, moving almost 100% in that one year alone. before ending on a high note depending on how flexible you were and traded the reversal. Sadly I didn't trade that year, had no idea wtf options even were. \n\n***going off on a tangent*** \\- I read up a lot on it(options) last year though and learned that selling credit spreads are god tier option strategies. You just simply sell to all the option junkies on WSB that like to make wild and outrageous bets, leveraging their stupidity for our gains. Also, not to mention, credit spreads mean you're technically also pricing in your stop loss to help manage risk. (Although there is a special and specific case where that doesn't happen when you let options go to expiration) With that being said, you should always close out your positions nonetheless if you risk assignment. Also, time will tell if I'm one of the stupid traders. If you can't see the black sheep, are YOU the black sheep?\n\n***Back on Track*** \\- 2019 starts with a bearish outlook but showed strong recovery. No indicator was sufficient enough to properly predict the movement. You can always make an argument, My macd indicator was showing weakness but bullish side, and the Rsi in the blah blah in the yoo hoo. if you simply traded the 50MA, Bullish when it was on the bullish end, meaning above, and bearish when below, you most likely had a good start to the year, but may have gotten chopped up by the market midway, since this strategy would've failed more often in the middle of the year. however,  It also reached high near previous multi-year highs.\n\nThis year, we are starting with a higher leg up, with a strong area of support around 1715-1825, and we just recently broke out of that range. 2020 in 2020, very possible by technical values. Trade deal might boost this. but who cares? i'm here to make money, and follow the wave on the charts.\n\n***My Main Point but not the point I wanted to make in the beginning, but satisfied anway*** \\- Everything here is IF you simply traded stocks by buying long and short positions. If you sold the weekly options, there are more cases of winners than losers. The average was 4 winners to 2 losers per month. And these credit spreads can sell for $120-150 AtM.  +$580 net average on the highest spectrum and +$220 on the lowest spectrum. The problem was there was a good period of time where the price was not at the trendlines, So you would most likely suffer losses if you went long, Simply for going long. which meant you had to consider the weekly movement as well. This is a drawback and a risk, but one I'll happily take since I like getting paid upfront.\n\n***Anywaay*** \\- 2020 AMZN is definitely going to reach 2020 at least once, it should, the technicals are all there, the chart analysis is there too, but nothing the in the market is absolute. Breaking it? has a better chance than 2019 had, and even better chance than 2018. 2020 is starting with a higher leg up.", "created_utc": 1579586821, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/erqi3g/amzn2020_in_2020/", "is_self": true}
