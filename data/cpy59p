{"id": "cpy59p", "title": "Grocery Outlet Earnings?", "selftext": "To me this company seems like it's about pop off. Last year they made $2 billion in profit selling grocery supplies at 40-60% markdown prices. This is like any other outlet store, they sell factory surplus, mislabels, and things that didn't sell very well. However, most people who go there end up buying a lot things cheap to cook the day of. Some products are close to expiring. In any case the company sells the franchises to people who have manager experience and want to open their own store. The company connects people with their network of people to contact to buy the cheap merchandise. They're opening a bunch of new stores, they're currently consolidated on the west coast. I'm not a vegan but going on twitter and doing research it seems that a lot of people who want to try or eat vegan food go here because they don't have to pay inflated prices and it's competitively priced to meat and such. IMO I feel like they will continue to grow even more so in a stagnated economy as they buy domestic surpluses so their exposure to China is minimized, unlike Dollar Tree, Dollar General or any other store that resells Chinese garbage. Dollar Tree was a huge winner during the sub prime crisis of 2008. Now they're going to be the big loser if it deteriorates and we hit recession. Convince me otherwise, because I'm gonna drop 50% of my portfolio at 3:58PM.", "created_utc": 1565724911, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cpy59p/grocery_outlet_earnings/", "is_self": true}
