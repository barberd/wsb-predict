Your a cautious bull though, with only one hoove over the line, slowly creeping forward to start buying weekly FD calls. Then BAM, a random tweet hits you and, well, they did have a good bear case, but you are firmly a bull. Slowly but surely the bear flags pick up. Might have 1-2 red days but they keep piling up. Choppiness overtakes your portfolio and Theta erodes your emotions away.\n\nFinally, while in your sad state of emotions, you go on twitter and dig and dig and dig, finally hit it! You found the one bear case that addresses your one and half concerns. So you do it, you wake up, sell 87% of your calls (the other 13% have no bidders), and buy some ATM puts. This is also the same time, you think you have inversed the market , while ignoring the fact that every other retard also had the same feeling because he convinced you somehow, who convinced the person before him. They the market becomes overweight as one side is \"winning.\" Then BAM the invisible hand comes in a brings \"confidence\" and \"order.\"\n\n\"A return to normalized capital markets\" - some might even say.\n\nThe very next day, you gave it away - you run for the hills, sell your puts, and go cashgang. Some algo buys your throwaways, sees some anomaly in the pricing spread so profitability looks like $2000 on a quickflip instead of normal $20. Algo auto sizes up the trade to hit $20 profit market.\n\nSome unusual options activity tracker picks this up and posts it. Now you, the newly found savant, have been refreshing twitter all day, have finally found the message you were looking for. Those contracts you threw away were on some unusual activities list, so you go back all in. \"I wasn't wrong, I was just a bit too early,\" you think to yourself while staring into the abyss.\n\nThe very next day, your account is down another 50%.\n\n# 7/17 MCD $220C", "created_utc": 1592967362.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/heswte/perhaps_a_lunatic_was_simply_a_minority_of_one/", "is_self": true}
