Going to copy over one of my comments, but it is no where near as a comprehensive explanation of the company as it should be. I'm hoping it goes back down soon, so I can buy some more shares, but I highly advise yall to check it out. The money they're bringing in is better than half these crap companies, but as usual, you're better off doing your due diligence - I'm honestly just surprised not many people are aware of this company, so take my 2 cents for what it is! No hard feelings \n\nCuraleaf, OTC, continuously overlooked, but doing better and better. I hate the pump it got from CGC/the sector, but the growth is slow and steady in all the best ways... Got approved for their first recreational license in Massachusetts, which is big because the queues in Massachusetts are ridiculous and their is high demand, so they will be able to capture a nice part of the market, and as far as their medical only stores go, they're doing well and their patients love then, and when you go in for a visit, they do a great job introducing you and informing you. They are great at answering questions you have before you ask them. I went in to see what it was like in New York, and they were amazing, and the clientele is very diverse. I've never seen so many people, middle aged, young, elderly in a dispensary, but then again, this is long island new York, and the competition is scarce. The best thing about this company is how little people know about it, especially on WSB", "created_utc": 1581821081, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f4k9ub/the_pot_stock_nobody_is_talking_about/", "is_self": true}
