{"id": "fg5fv2", "title": "White House Tomorrow", "selftext": "Two things happened today: trump said he\u2019s bringing CEO\u2019s in to White House tomorrow.  And he floated a plan for payroll cuts among other things.  Details to come tomorrow.  \n\nCEOs come in, trump asks what he needs to do to turn the stock market around.  CEOs ask for the world.  \n\nI expect to see something ridiculously stupid and favorable for companies released tomorrow.  Remember the coronavirus is driving market down because of financial impact to companies.  If trump can partially offset some of that in the short term he can turn the market green.  I\u2019m in spy calls that I bought today 3/13 290 and 3/13 300.  Will pick up more on open.  Corona is most likely a 2-3 quarter impact.  If tax cuts go for a year and are meaningful I think spy goes back to 300+ in the next week.", "created_utc": 1583801842, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fg5fv2/white_house_tomorrow/", "is_self": true}
