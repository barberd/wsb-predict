That in turn led to a \u201cthundering herd\u201d effect\u2014triggering a failure of our DNS system.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nMultiple factors contributed to the unprecedented load that ultimately led to the outages. The factors included, among others, highly volatile and historic market conditions; record volume; and record account sign-ups.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe take our responsibility to you and your money seriously and understand the significance and inconvenience this may have had on you and your account. We also want to thank you for your patience this week and for being a Robinhood customer. We\u2019ll continue working hard to improve your experience and earn your trust.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSincerely,\n\nTaylorAnne\n\nBuy calls in TD Ameritrade? TOS life.
