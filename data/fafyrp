{"id": "fafyrp", "title": "Insider Trading Megathread", "selftext": "I was captured by the Bloomberg Empire and interrogated for weeks in the dungeons of Michael Bloomberg's secret headquarters: The Morning Star. The methods they used to get me to disclose the information I stole were... severe. My butthole will never be the same. Alas, I held out without telling them anything. I was convinced all hope was lost and was attempting to drown myself in my own piss when my cell door opened. \n\n\"Aren't you a little retarded to be a Bloomberg Trooper?\" I asked the man standing there. When he took off his mask I gasped in shock.\n\n\"I'm from r/wallstreetbets I'm here to rescue you,\" he said.\n\n\"You're what?\"\n\n\"I'm here to rescue you. I've got your Robinhood app. I'm here with u/1R0NYMAN !\"\n\n\" u/1R0NYMAN ? Where is he! Does he have tendies?\" I replied, ecstatic.\n\n\"C'mon!\" the man yelled as we ran out the door and into the hallway. Suddenly, we were ambushed by a squad of Bloomberg Troopers and had to run for our lives. We finally got to the extraction point where a ship was waiting for us, still under fire by the enemy. Then I saw him: a beautiful, well-endowed man with a luscious ass, crammed to the brim with fresh tendies: u/1R0NYMAN in the flesh. We were about to board the ship when suddenly we heard a noise behind us. We turned around. Michael Bloomberg stood there, large red dildo-saber in hand.\n\n\"Get behind me,\" u/1R0NYMAN said as he took out his (much larger) blue dildo-saber.\n\n\"I've been waiting for you, we meet at last. The circle is now complete. When I discovered you I was but the learner, now I am the master,\" Bloomberg said.\n\n\"Only the master of the bears, Mike,\" u/1R0NYMAN  said as their sabers began to clash. I ran aboard the ship with my rescuer. My robinhood app was waiting for me. I frantically began buying otm MSFT and SPY calls. Perhaps if I made a profit I'd be able to gain enough power to help defeat Bloomberg.\n\n\"Your tendies are small, old man,\" I heard Bloomberg say from outside the ship.\n\n\"You can't win Mike. If you strike me down, the market will become more bullish than you can possibly imagine,\" u/1R0NYMAN replied.\n\nThe ship began to take off as I looked on in horror at the duel before me. u/1R0NYMAN  looked over at me, smiling slighty. Then, in a swift motion, Michael Bloomberg sliced him with his dildo and he vanished into thin air.\n\n\"Nooo!\" I yelled as the ship lifted off the ground and flew away.\n\nThis brings us to now: I am hiding at a secret bull encampment somewhere underneath Wall Street. The Bloomberg Empire is still searching for me. I'm not sure how much time I have left. My robinhood app has reached new lows of -$90K. But I know I must reveal the insider information I stole in hopes that it can help defeat Bloomberg and allow r/wallstreetbets to flourish in the magnificent fields of tendies it deserves:\n\nBears are still, in fact, gay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMany retards died to bring us this information.
