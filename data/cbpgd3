{"id": "cbpgd3", "title": "ONE DAY PDT Breakout challange", "selftext": "So... I have a fantastic idea that I think is completly foolproof baring one condition. Hear my thesis. I make good trades scalping, which I do once a day, three times a week. I basically always make money, but I have a small account still and am far below 25k. What if, one day I just decided to do UNLIMITED day trades on RH with the goal of getting to 25k in one day of scalping??? I mean, I pay no fees or commission on RH and can literally do 1000 trades if I wanted to. \n\nMy understanding is that when I exceed my 3 day trades I will be barred from further day trades for 90 days. If I do a 4th... I get banned from any buying ot selling for 90 days... however, will RH impose these restrictions immediately or do I have the whole day to continue trading?\n\nThat, is the question.", "created_utc": 1562808429, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cbpgd3/one_day_pdt_breakout_challange/", "is_self": true}
