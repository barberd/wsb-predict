In the past couple years there has been a lot of light shed on racism, sexism, and insensitivity in general. What I have been looking at is buying dips related to these events. Good examples are SBUX, NIKE, and PZZA.  All of these companies have had controversy that caused people who are too attached to their feelings (non-autists) to react with their money. \n\n1)Starbuck\u2019s company wide sensitivity training seemed to get people\u2019s forgiveness. \n2)People who think kaepernick shouldn\u2019t have taken a knee are buying Nike products again and \n3) papa john is nowhere to be seen and bro-culture in boardrooms is off the hot seat for now\n\nAll of these stocks had a significant dip just because the company name was tied too close to social justice hot topics and seemed to recover\n\nAny other examples here?
