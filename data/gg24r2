Also active in the tele-health sector\n\n\u00b7  Increase in web traffic (remember Netflix reducing video quality?) is another potential catalyst for their hardware segment as tech companies  could be panic adding capacity\n\n\u00b7  CEO mentioned they had been working around the clock on video interview with CNBC, to ensure businesses stay functioning through COVID-19\n\n\u00b7  Recent conference call on their investor relations website outlining  their remote work portfolio seems to have been slept on also price wise\n\nTechnical\n\n\u00b7 Stock traded in 50\u2019s, for much of 2019 then was slapped down by trade war headlines\n\n\u00b7 Dumped last 3 ER\u2019s , trade war related fears \u2013 expectations for upcoming ER are low\n\n\u00b7 Previous ER\u2019s have shown decent jumps (check 2018)\n\n\u00b7 Hasn\u2019t recovered like competing networking stocks (Juniper Networks, Arista networks)\n\n\u00b7 Option volatility has also remained quite low throughout March/April \u2013 options pretty much imply no movement\n\n\u00b7 Bottomed and bounced from the upper 30\u2019s to low 40\u2019s and has been stuck in a range since\n\n\u00b7  Stock has tried to break out several times in April, random dumps due to macro related factors (mid April \u2013 negative Oil fears, 29th - 1st May  dump from tech sell-off/supposed trade deal collapsing tweet)\n\nPossible risk factors mostly come from big IT spending being potentially put on hold due to companies having cash flow issues/supply chain issues  delaying hardware production (as stated by other networking hardware markers) \u2013 biggest catalysts for a potential dump post ER. Equally could  surprise to upside given all the coronavirus related catalysts and low expectations\n\nDisclaimer: I own 50c LEAPs, building a position since March, great company fundamentals, survived multiple crises (tech bubble, 2008) and has the highest dividend yield in the NASDAQ \u2013 how this has been slept on since March/April I have no idea.
