I keep telling myself to sell before earnings.. to collect that sweet pre-earnings IV gain profit, but every single fucking time I bet these earnings, it's like my fucked sessions at blackjack. \n\nI'm already down 6k but want to at least break even so chase that loss and big boi bet time. purple chips = 500 and I put two down. I get dealt two 8's and dealers showing a 6 - FUCK YES. we know what time this madda fucka is... split that shit or tickle my ass clit. dealer splits, I hit and it's another fucking 8... yup i thrice slice and dice. now I got three 8's showing, it's 3k deep for this hand. everyone knows 888 is good luck in asian culture so I hit up my ladiboi and have him by my side as i rub that pencil cock for the luck juice. Magic time bois. hit the first 8 and get a 9. **stay**\n\nhit the second 8 and get a 3. oh boy im bout to buskaknut cause its double down time! MONKEY - i scream.. MONKEY MONKEY MONKEY!!!, dealer pulls out an ace. oh great.\n\nhit the third 8 and get a duece so its double mc trouble time! FACE CARD! FACE CARD!!! FACE OR ACE!! dealer pulls out a king. My god my heart is pounding out my god damn chest. atleast one hand is a win. I just need this faggot dealer to busk and I scoop a 5k double up. just enough to break even. \n\ndealer turns over the other card and it's a fucking 5. My dick is dripping sweat and my knuckles are white from pressing it against the felt. I dont even know what. Im just praying for a bust and the dealer pulls out a 10. I'm felted. The tense clenching of my asshole is now released. I lost everything I brought. Another sad depressing night of gamboling. I maxed out my ATM withdraws for the day and the banks are closed... my heads down as I slowly walk to the exit of the casino... until I remember... CASH ADVANCES!!!!! WOOO HOOO!!! It's only like 49% interest. I'll save PT 2 of this story another day...\n\n\nanyways - what are your thoughts on ROKU, SQ and QCOM?", "created_utc": 1572969125, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ds11oz/earnings_play_today/", "is_self": true}
