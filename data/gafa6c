Here's a list of current positions that I've entered today and my rationale.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPK 5/15 12.5C: aggressive option sweeps on this specific strike and exp. OI is 335, Vol 4000+.\n\nCCXI 5/15 55C: 3 drugs in phase II, one phase III. Large Call debit spread, indicating bullish sentiment. Tiny volume usually, low trading volume as well. Very out of the ordinary. Would not recommend for those without risk tolerance, B/A spreads are huge.\n\nCPRI 5/1 17C: Lots of volume, newly opened positions plus large block order of 2500 entered today, expiring friday. Insider trading signs. I feel most confident about this trade.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's a little update, good luck during power hour ya'll. Do your own DD and choose your own exits wisely.", "created_utc": 1588186753.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gafa6c/my_current_positions/", "is_self": true}
