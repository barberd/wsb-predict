{"id": "fjnro5", "title": "I think we're being short squeezed by the administration [DD]", "selftext": "**Intro**\n\nI'll keep it short. This may be a simple thing, but I just realized what the strategy behind it might be. Maybe you didn't know either. Disclaimer: Not investment advice, total BS I just been thinking about over the weekend.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Meat**\n\n\n\n* **Stimuli & Brief overview**: The fed keeps doing everything it can to keep the shit show behind the curtains running. We're talking about the repo market, T-bills, MBS's, etc. Rate cuts, QE, QE with a blowjob, buying equities, all on the table, some already executed. These actions are in an indirect way a benefit to shit leveraged American hero companies, such as GE & AAL. They need the credit lines to keep the lights on & so do a billion other enterprises. So liquidity is a great thing for the banks & their shit corporations which should've never made it past 2008. \n\n\n\n* **Why it's not effective for stonks**: You may imagine it would affect the stock market but it doesn't trickle down as much to the stonks, as the fed are not providing blowjobs for these shit levered companies, they are literally injecting them with blood & a 4-person CPR. So the effect of these stimuli, is very dampened.\n\n\n\n* **What does this have to do with the squeeze?** The new strategy of Johnald is to schedule press conferences for 3:00PM ET. He comes on late at 3:30PM with some \"good\" \"news\". Mostly lies, obfuscations, exaggerations, a game politicians & Johnald are particularly skilled at. This pumps the market bigly 10-15 points. So, if you're a big player, you shorted calls, sold futures, whatever the fuck it is you did, you are immediately past your stop loss in 30 minutes OR LESS (more like 10). Big players may cover their shorts because who the fuck knows, maybe Trump will announce that the Fed now owns all of SP500 & the Fed is now merged with JP Morgan & Lehman brothers is back from the dead & they are the new Fed. Who the fuck knows right?\n\n\n\n* **What I think this means**: The short term pumps will keep happening until a new bottom is reached. I estimate this bottom to be around 2000 (historical lows suggest lower, but I think human psychology likes that round number & going lower requires a big behind the curtains shitshow, which I believe the Fed will prevent this time, realistically). I think when the larger players keep getting burned, the market may be a little less oversold, but it's a temporary measure from the Admin for sure.\n\n\n* **What you should do**: You should trade based on fundamentals. In a market like this, if you're trying to be a bull, try to find a fair price for the underlying. Keep your old strategy. If you're a gay bear or swing, widen your stop loss & hold. If you entered a position you didn't have the guts to take the max loss on, maybe short selling isn't for you. Don't sell in a panic, don't enter in a panic. The market has a lot of room to wiggle, we have just begun.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**TL;DR**: The WH tried everything (repo, loosening, etc). Didn't work. They know the market will move 10+/- points in one day, so they're squeezing short sellers by causing skyrockets which push past stop losses really quickly causing short covers.  \n\n\n**TL;DR for TL;DR: Johnald's announcements are short squeezes to push past stop losses very quickly**\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nShort positions\n\n    $SPY $230 $240P 4/17\n    $SPY 3/20 IC 225P / 230P / 250C / 255C\n    $SH 5/15 $24c $25c $26c\n\nExiting all airlines & travel EOD 3/16, Airlines part of large stimulus package pending congressional approval.
