The cruise ship gives us an upper bound on the infection fatality ratio (IFR). \n\nOver the past two weeks, we haven't seen enough deaths from the dataset to indicate that this is truly a horrific scenario. \n\nSo far, 7 out of 696 of the patients have died. This gives us an infection fatality rate upper bound of around 1%, this data represents an upper bound since the ship is skewed old. It looks like it's about 10x worse than seasonal flu.\n\nNow, here's where it starts to get ugly. Based on the American government's non-chalance, the relative non-chalance of the general public, and the lack of early outbreak detection because of the CDC's sluggish response; we are going to see some really bad disruption in the next 2-4 weeks.\n\nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20021154v1\n\nHere's a pre print from Los Alamos labs published in late January. They modelled the reproductive rate in Wuhan when the outbreak was still circulating undetected. They found R_0 between 4-6, vastly higher than, say, 1.5-2.5 for bad flu seasons. \n\nWhy is this paper significant? It's significant because viral reproductive rates depend on external factors like social distance, isolation, and so on.\n\nWhat does it tell us? It tells us that every densely populated city in the US that has public transportation (NYC, Chi, etc) is at serious risk of becoming the next Wuhan.\n\nWhat will happen if the CDC continues to fail to precautionarily test, isolate, and target outbreaks, warning local areas and counties of the contagion?\n\nIf 20% of the US is going to be infected like pandemic flu, about 500,000 people will die using 0.25% infection fatality ratio among the entire population. 0.25% infection fatality ratio is an estimate back calculated from the age distribution from Diamond Princess population mapped to the age distribution of the US population. \n\nDo with this information what you like.\n\nTl;dr this is at least 5x as bad as H1N1 2009.", "created_utc": 1583613768.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ff173u/diamond_princess_coronavirus_protip_update/", "is_self": true}
