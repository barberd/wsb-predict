As we analyzed last Wendesday, the market will continue to stay mostly flat until 2pm EST on Wednesday when the Fed releases the coming interest rates, however, I am slightly bullish with the overnight futures movement.\n\nTimes like this give us an opportunity to test our patience and learn zero delta strategies which are an extremely important tool in our toolbox. \n\nCongrats to everyone who played FB calls with us yesterday! That's one of the individual names that is moving hard right now!\n\nChart -&gt;  https://imgur.com/gallery/UTPKvvS\n\nTrade Smart.
