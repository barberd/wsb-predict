Just like in 1918, the market is forming a W bottom to hit the ATH again(technical speculative). The stock market was at an all time high and there was no indication that the market was going into recession especially with such a steady volume/increase in the market.                                                         \n\nSome might argue that 1918 pandemic fall took 2 years to bottom out, but in average, there has been 5% decrease in the first 24days in every bear market history. However, the market fell 34% in the first 24days before it reached the bottom from COVID-19. This shows that the market is moving 6-7 times more volatile compare to the past. Which explains how the market bottomed out in around 3months instead of 2 years (24months/7 = 3.42 months).          \n\nIn my opinion, we will test the bottom once more to for a W shape bottom but it won\u2019t fall significantly more than that. Then the stocks will recover from this virus and go up once again to test the all time high w/ this volatility. After a significant increase we hit the real recession in the future, just like in 1929 after the great pandemic. COVID-19 is not going to be the cause of the next bear market, the real bubble is yet to pop. This is not going to turn into a recession, we have yet to see the real recession coming in the future.\n\n[edited LINK](https://imgur.com/xMXRvQO)", "created_utc": 1586406875.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxlvy8/this_is_not_a_real_recession_its_just_an_impact/", "is_self": true}
