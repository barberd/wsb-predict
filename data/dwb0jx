To us, it\u2019s highly intuitive to watch the slope (rate-of-change) of annual data because this provides a clear signal for the data set in question, and it avoids the noise that necessarily plagues the growth rate from one month to the next. Yet what is intuitive to us eludes the Old Institution.\n\nLast week, the Old Institution grabbed the better-than-expected +1.9% quarterly growth rate of Q3 GDP with both hands. Even our Tweeter-In-Chief took a victory lap for having created \u201cthe greatest economy in American history\u201d despite lamenting \u201cthe economy is in deep trouble\u201d seven years ago when U.S. GDP hit the exact same +1.9% level of GDP growth.\n\nWhile the OI and the President are navel-gazing quarterly growth rates that are jumping all over the place like a toddler on a sugar high, the annual growth rate of U.S. GDP has been painting a crystal-clear picture for a year now.\n\nNot only did the annual pace of Q3 2019 GDP growth (+2.0%) confirm the slowdown from Q2 2019 GDP (+2.3%), it established the Winter Fundamental Gravity that occurred from July to September 2019. Since peaking in Q3 2018, U.S. GDP growth has been in a bear market and is officially in crash mode, declining 38% from its peak growth rate of +3.2%.\n\nFor all the Old Institution cronies, and reformed brokers, telling you to buy stocks because growth slowing is now in the rearview, think again.\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve seen eight critical U.S. data points for Q4, and they are painting the same growth slowing picture we\u2019ve seen for the last four quarters. While there was a one-off improvement in October jobless claims and the ISM non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), there has been a continued deterioration across auto sales, nonfarm payroll growth, average hourly earnings, consumer confidence surveys, and the all-important, ISM manufacturing PMI. We still have an additional 20 critical data points to come, but the early polling is indicating a Q4 GDP annual growth rate with a 1-handle!\n\nIf you\u2019re in the Old Institution camp, insisting that the quarterly growth rate is the cat\u2019s pajamas, an annual GDP growth rate with a one in front of it, means the quarterly growth rate will be sub-one percent. Guaranteed President Trump chirps Jerome Powell for not doing enough when Q4 GDP growth lays an egg when the report is released in late January 2020.\n\nRemember, the business media/Old Institution \u201clevels\u201d obsession means they fail to spot shifts in Fundamental Gravities until months after the fact. By the time the data has deteriorated (or accelerated) to levels that send them a clear signal, asset classes have already responded to the new economic conditions. In short, by the time the Old Institution acknowledges the changed environment, the low-risk, high-reward trades are as dead as disco.\n\nThe headline risk bottom line is that the early Q4 data is confirming that the U.S. economy is firmly entrenched in the growth slowing regime that began 15 months ago. Couple this reality with the beginning stages of an inflationary impulse, and there is no doubt that Fall is here.
