I keep seeing posts comparing this recession to the 2008 crisis and a lot of comments arguing its different. I\u2019m here to bring up how it might be more similar than we think. \n\nSo we all know that unemployment is skyrocketing and only getting worse as restaurants shut down, retails closed, and so forth. Well all those people are going still going to have to pay mortgages. However, with the fucked up policies on rent deferrals going on like bofa expecting a full payment once the crisis is over, a lot of people are going to miss payments on rent and mortgages. These people may have had okay credit scores but these circumstances are gonna cause them to miss payments. Especially if they cant get any income with out slow ass unemployment offices being jammed packed. And $1200 wont cut it.\n\nSo basically its pretty similar to 2008 again since trump allowed big banks to use those tricky derivatives to make gains off of the housing market again. These banks are going to foreclose a bunch of houses with no buyers on the market. \n\nRight? I was only half paying attention to the movie. \n\nNKE 80p 4/03 yeeeeahhh boiiiii", "created_utc": 1585852611.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ftrsrj/a_little_thought_experiment_on_housing/", "is_self": true}
