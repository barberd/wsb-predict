{"id": "ef11st", "title": "Feeling Lucky about Luckin (LK)", "selftext": "While everyone is obsessed over making calls on ROKU, I\u2019ve been counting tendies on my (albeit small) position on LK. \nOn November 12, this was at $19. Now after a 10% jump yesterday it\u2019s at $35. Luckin is a coffee company created to compete with Starbucks (and eventually blow it out of the water). It specializes in deliveries as you can\u2019t actually enter a cafe other than to make an order. The reason this is so popular in China is because of coffee culture at work ; coworkers like to order together as a group as a form of bonding . China would also never let a foreign company become a leader in something ((especially as stagnant as Starbucks)). Let\u2019s see what their counter is to KFC and MCD .. that\u2019s the real challenge for them . Everyone please post your Luckin stories so we can get a proper circle jerk going!", "created_utc": 1577192346, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ef11st/feeling_lucky_about_luckin_lk/", "is_self": true}
