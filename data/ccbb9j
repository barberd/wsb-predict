{"id": "ccbb9j", "title": "Long(ish) Hold TQQQ - Besides obvious, what is the downside?", "selftext": "As I said, besides the obvious points of leverage decay and people saying \"iTs SuPeR vOlItIlE\" what are the real reasons not to buy and hold this? I'm definitely considering doing this after the future 2020ish recession hits.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnly real fear that I can rationalize is that if the NASDAQ goes down 33%, you technically will loss 99% of your investment and the only real danger I can see is if the fund itself completely closes down. What I can see on the other hand happening is there will be reverse splits down in order to maintain the price above $0. However, as I see it (autistic) you still own shares, shares which if the market doesn't explode, will EVENTUALLY return to at least where the market was before the downturn. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRegardless, buying and holding TQQQ now wouldn't be smart at the top of the longest bull run in history. Are their legitimate reasons why this is considered dangerous? It seems pretty hard to convince me otherwise after a 5 year return of 500%, and if it had been around in 2009, most likely 1000%.", "created_utc": 1562940518, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ccbb9j/longish_hold_tqqq_besides_obvious_what_is_the/", "is_self": true}
