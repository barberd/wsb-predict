I played around with stock market for fun past 2 years and it has been a fun ride. Its a small amount that I invest as I only want to learn now. I have been talking about stocks to my friend for months and teaching him basic stuff. During this break, he finally found time to invest. He started with RH at 2000 Dollars.\n\nThen advised him to switch to TD Bank. He has been doing lots of research then suddenly he moved 25K to TD to Buy American airlines. Then he went all in and added another 386K.\n\nI think so far he got 1000 shares of AAL and 26,040 shares of DAL. He is up 26K so far today and got some serious diamond hands. He is super excited about stocks now, you know that Initial high. I have feeling this is gonna end badly. But at same time, I understand these stocks are riding at all time low. I have been begging to sell everything and play with 26K profits but dude wont listen. FUCK\n\nI have asked him to hedge with puts but he wont listen. This week has been a wild ride and no one expected this surge. Market will do whatever it wants so another drop is still in the picture. Im worried about the dude. I will never talk about stocks to anyone. Lesson learned. Any thoughts on Delta and AA ?
