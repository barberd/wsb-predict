With that in mind I want to draw your attention to $STOK. I think you\u2019ll find the similarities uncanny: STONK-STOK, STOK-STONK. The only difference being the letter N. I found that when typing S,T,O,N,K in RH the following come up as the first result for each letter: Sprint, AT&amp;T, Realty Income, Netflix and Kellogg. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow let\u2019s go a little deeper. Out of those five, Netflix has done the best by far over the last 3mo and is essentially pulling the STONKs right now. So my logic is that if you take out Netflix which is the best performing out of all the STONKs then you are left with STOK, and if STONKs without Netflix are bad then $STOK is bad. And if $STOK is bad then $STOK puts are good. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019ll catch all you Bullfags in the breadline, I\u2019ll be the one flexing on you with my gold-plated bicycle helmet that I\u2019m required to wear at all times.", "created_utc": 1580597369, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/exe2o7/just_hear_me_out/", "is_self": true}
