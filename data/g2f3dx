A reminder - in 2008-2012 QE didnt increase M3 much, just replaces credit money (dropped credit multiplicator from 17 to 4 and will not drop more probably), this probably why inflation didnt increase much those years. Additionally, dollar was an international currency, so part of inflation was exported to other countries. What do you think could happen how?\n\n0) if all will go as it was, good old USA monetary dominance way - consequences? Objections?\n\n1) all countries perform equivalent QE (recall post 2008 exchange rate wars) to stop importing inflation from US. Situation will temporary stabilize, banks will have time to reallocate resources and run from the sinking ship. Where? In what banks will invest? \n\n1.1) additionally main international players will start to reduce share of dollars in international trade, aiming to replace dollar as The Main currency. what do you think about possible reaction of USA?\n\n2) default of USA (and other countries) - list of countries, possible scenarios? Who will pay for that? 15trln$ US government owed to US citizens and only 1trln$ to China, so probably US citizens will pay for consequences with retirement money. Your thoughts?\n\n3) if you have 10-30k$ now, in what you will invest to minimize losses? maximize profits?", "created_utc": 1587044448.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2f3dx/qe_101_sos_challenge_share_your_craziest/", "is_self": true}
