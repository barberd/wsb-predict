Me personally, I\u2019m almost at 4 figures on my portfolio with SPCE taking up my entire account so it\u2019s only a matter of time before I ride this wave to my very own yacht. But as far as I\u2019m concerned, all current holders of SPCE are virgins.\n\nAnd it needs to stay that way. \n\nWe virgins need to unite in this, and I promise you coke and hookers galore. Here\u2019s the catch\u2014you CANNOT abandon ship at any time until you are no longer a virgin. If you leave your positions and still haven\u2019t slammed cooter, you break the illusion. The stock will tank as a result of your sins. You may ONLY sell after you no longer have the title of \u201cVirgin.\u201d\n\nYou need to grip your positions like you\u2019ve gripped your dicks for the past decades, as the market rewards this kind of purity. All this requires of you is to enter your positions as a virgin. Lose it and then you can sell. It\u2019s that simple.\n\nTo those who fuck or have fucked: go away, you are not welcome here in this precious stock. Don\u2019t ruin this for us of pure heart and dry genitalia.\n\nI propose proof of virginity to accompany any post regarding positions in SPCE, and for users who fail to comply to be banned on the spot for poisoning the well.\n\n\nBefore you ask me for proof of my own virginity, I feel that this post is enough to show my sexual status.\nTo SPCE bears: thanks in advance", "created_utc": 1581551026, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f30j0b/listen_up_virgins/", "is_self": true}
