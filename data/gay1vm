Calls!", "selftext": "Ok, so I have been following Devon since it crashed with the whole oil craziness, it dropped as far as near $4 a share, it's currently trading around 12.50.\n\nNow the drop was related to the entire market sentiment and the oil price drop, however the main production of Devon is NGL and natural gas. \n\nNatural gas took a hit right along with oil but has traded much more stable since. \n\nHere's my research and hypothesis. Natural gas will stay pretty level, it's used for power generation, heating homes (short term while summer will see this drop), but lot only that, many houses uses natural gas for stoves and ovens (every ones cooking in quarantine) and even to power houshold appliances such as washers and dryers. \n\n\nDVN stock has already shown great resistance to sell offs bouncing back from most downs within a day or 2. Showing a trader belief in strong fundimentals.\n\nHAL (similar company focus) already had and earnings call and very clearly beat their expected EPS. DVN Eps is very low due to the general oil sentiment. The earnings is coming up may 5 and these sentiments will prove to be way off the mark IMO.\n\nTlDR, Devon Energy is over sold and EPS estimate is too low. \n\nDVN 12.50C 5/8\n\nEdit: spelling.", "created_utc": 1588261349.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gay1vm/dvn_devon_technologies_calls/", "is_self": true}
