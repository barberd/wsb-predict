I was a big bear during the US-China trade war and thought we had begun a correction in the market but unfortunately, all my SPY 290 and 300 puts were shot down.\n\nFinally turned bull this February and was washed out again (RIP all my $MSFT 185c) so inverse all my trades. Also sold 600 shares of ZM at $76 which would be worth almost double right now because I have toilet paper hands.\n\nDon't fucking doubt your vibe.\n\n[Realized losses](https://preview.redd.it/bp7koch0v1o41.png?width=1642&format=png&auto=webp&s=077227989a542a41753ed37e0aef5cbd9c16bb88)\n\nRIP all my SPY puts \ud83d\ude2d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[RIP ](https://preview.redd.it/i6amuw1qv1o41.png?width=926&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cc7f3fa0f58a251bcee34d2fe22c091a3dfb54a)\n\n[Fuck you too $ZM](https://preview.redd.it/lhya1pz8v1o41.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cc8fe6677233bff3c0ae91d71f21e06b79b6389)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 1: I had $LVS puts I sold too early.
