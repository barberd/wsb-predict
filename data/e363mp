It wasn't on my radar as it has very low volume which wouldn't trip on my scanner.  The way I came about it was because I had to go shopping for shoes and a friend recommended Shoe Carnival to me.  Now, I had heard of the company before but never really shopped there and didn't even know it was a public company.  I ended up getting a pair of sneakers there for dirt cheap but that wasn't what interested me.\n\nI went back home and was curious so I dug up some info on the company and realized it was  traded.  Being an non-autistic WSBer, I researched the shit out of it the last few days and come to the conclusion that this is a MONSTER squeeze candidate in the making.  Just look at the numbers above.\n\nWith OVER 50% of the available shares shorted, and an extremely low float (only 9.1 million shares available), any major purchase of even a thousand shares is enough to move it like crazy.  The bid-ask spread on this the last few days is usually 0.5% or more because of such low liquidity.  This tells me that MM's and brokers won't be holding alot of this stock making gigantic moves more likely (ie. don't do market buys/sells!).  The last few trading days, the volume that is SHORT is above 10% of the total volume which has been steady.  This tells me that there is still a decent amount of short interest here (likely averaging UP) from existing shorts.\n\nThe earnings themselves beat AND raised.  The after hours movement the stock touched $40 but the day after it dropped back down (many factors, $FL reported earnings the morning which disappointed so sympathetic drop, more shorts piling on averaging UP to play a rip-bounce reversal).  The stock has seen a temporary rip generally in the mornings of 1-5% after the earnings only to reverse it all.  It's been holding steady as I believe it looks to be accumulation.  The company also has a buyback program with $19.1 million left on the books.  If they were to buy it all back today, it will reduce the float even more (another 500K shares).\n\nOn their latest earnings conference call, they mention they are well-insulated from tariffs as the majority of their inventory comes from Viet Nam which means no Trump-China BS affecting them (other than weak bagholders causing price to drop on selling).\n\nShoes may not interest the common WSB.  But given the numbers shown above, I can see this gapping slowly towards $50 in the next few weeks.  This suggests a potential 30% gain in the next month on a relatively safe bet.  Be warned though, that because of the low float, the daily movements in this stock may be stomach churning so my advice would be to buy it, forget it.  Hell, even set up some buy limit orders that is 1-2% below the price and you may be surprised that you can pick it up on random stop loss picking dips.\n\nI'm personally in this one at an average of 35.88 @ 3400 shares.  I have firepower capital to buy another 4600 shares on dips.  I will be holding and selling at $50 if it hits.  I might sell 34 contracts of covered calls at either $40 or $45 for the Dec 20 monthly to protect myself a bit in case it has a random intraday dip, in which case I buy back the calls for a small discount.  Usually, the intraday dip corrects itself quickly and I will probably sell the same number of calls again.
