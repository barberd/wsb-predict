{"id": "galjvz", "title": "MACY's Fireside Chat TOMORROW", "selftext": "Macy's is hosting a little fireside chat tomorrow with good 'ol Gordon Haskett whose company  \"publishes highly differentiated, independent research to a targeted group of institutional investors. \"\n\nNow I don't have a fucking clue what they are going to discuss at this nice little fireside chat, but I'm pretty sure it's not going to be how shitty Macy's is and the impending Chapter 11. No, it's going to be all unicorns and rainbows and I'll bet a good portion of it will be how great they are going to be, how they're going to reopen and come back better than ever blah blah blah. Pretty sure they're going to discuss what a great fucking company Macy's is and the thanksgiving parade and those balloons and herald square and the company is not going to go away so BTFD. As a result I am naturally YOLO'ing all my money on 2 DTE ATM calls which seem to be pretty cheap.\n\nTLDR: M 5/1 6.50c\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2020-04-27/macy-s-inc-to-participate-in-virtual-fireside-chat-with-gordon-haskett-research-advisors](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2020-04-27/macy-s-inc-to-participate-in-virtual-fireside-chat-with-gordon-haskett-research-advisors)", "created_utc": 1588207201.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/galjvz/macys_fireside_chat_tomorrow/", "is_self": true}
