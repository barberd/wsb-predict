{"id": "cnxiwd", "title": "The Fool cannot be trusted - the ol' switcheroo from AAXN to AX", "selftext": "This morning I read an article titled \"[3 Stocks That Are Absurdly Cheap Right Now](https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/08/08/3-stocks-that-are-absurdly-cheap-right-now.aspx)\". One stock such \"absurdly cheap\" stock was Axon Enterprises (AAXN). There was no financial substance behind the claim. No, I didn't buy calls as I'd taken my medication already.\n\nThen, AAXN reported after hours and tanked -9%.\n\nThe same article has since been replaced with Axos Financial (AX) instead of Axon Enterprises. Funny thing is, they haven't changed the metadata tags, so when you [search AAXN in the Fool](https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/axon-enterprise/aaxn/), the news article to Axos still appears. I can't figure out how to find the earlier version of the AAXN article (I tried Google cache to no avail; so I got no proof unfortunately).\n\nWhat are the chances both tickers AAXN and AX were absurdly cheap on the same day, and why did the Fool have to remove the AAXN article?\n\nTL:DR - inverse the fucking Fool. At least WSB are proud of our mistakes; how else we gonna learn.", "created_utc": 1565326204, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cnxiwd/the_fool_cannot_be_trusted_the_ol_switcheroo_from/", "is_self": true}
