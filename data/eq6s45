If I purchase $500 worth of this call option at a strike price of $5 is my calculation correct that I'd buy at the ask of $11 per call aka \\~45. Then does this mean if SPCE is at $100 by Jan 21, 2022 I'm set to make $427,500? On the flip side would I only lose money if the stock is below $5 at the time of expiry? \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xvpsm2aqoeb41.png?width=982&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f2c50a7a270b8df02f430b6ea5f7100af15dc2b", "created_utc": 1579296386, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eq6s45/purchasing_my_first_call_option_is_this_train_of/", "is_self": true}
