Hold your puts. Hold them to the death or until they rise like the Phoenix of the sun. Either way, there will be fire, but hold the line. Tonight we rest, dreaming of beautiful, glorious tendies. Tomorrow, we SLAY THE DAY. ITS KILL OR BE KILLED AND WE ARE THE PINNACLE. WE WILL BE VICTORIOUS. Soon we will own the MOTHERFUCKING WORLD. May your hands remain steady, your hearts remain strong, and your tickers remain green. It's a disastrous yet beautiful bitch, this stock market. However we have done the minimal research necessary to tame this beast. Stay vigilant, very vigilant in the pursuit of our glorious goal.
