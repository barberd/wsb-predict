{"id": "f936fe", "title": "GRUB DD", "selftext": "TL;DR Buy Grub Puts \n\nFirst DD post so bear with me, I work at fairly busy burger joint which accepts online orders through our website, Doordash, UberEats, Postmates, and Grubhub. \n\nI\u2019d like to make a few points that I\u2019ve observed over the time since we started accepting these delivery services (all implemented within two months of each other).\n\n1) The amount of orders we receive through Grubhub is SIGNIFICANTLY lower than ANY other service we accept (I would estimate that probably 5% of our online orders is through Grubhub, meaning we\u2019d get 5 Grubhub orders for every 100 online orders).\n\n2) While the other services usually instantly send drivers to pick up the food, it seems that Grubhub REALLY struggles with their drivers. More times than not, Grubhub orders wait under our heatlamp for more than 20min before a driver even accepts on their end, which usually results in the food becoming cold regardless.\n\n3) The tablets in which we receive orders from are provided by the delivery service and the tablet provided by Grubhub has run into the most issues by far in terms of technical functionality, contacting customers about item(s), and this might be unique to my workplace, but Grubhub drivers can\u2019t view any drink items which can cause a lot of confusion for the driver.\n\nJust to be clear, I don\u2019t have any positions in GRUB and this post was inspired by my hatred towards them.\n\nI\u2019m usually wrong so go ahead and inverse this but it\u2019s very hard to defend this service with all of the struggles that it causes.", "created_utc": 1582598535, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f936fe/grub_dd/", "is_self": true}
