Lowe\u2019s still has another 10-15 points to rise before earnings on 5/20. They will also crush earnings....the Lowe\u2019s subreddits are all talking about sales being 100-200% higher than expected daily, go by their stores they are absolutely packed, they just gave $80M in bonuses and $1M in flower donations for Mother\u2019s Day. They are rolling in the dough and are undervalued right now. Get in now before it\u2019s too late.\n\nPosition: LOW 120c 5/22", "created_utc": 1589483896.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gjszgo/low_hd/", "is_self": true}
