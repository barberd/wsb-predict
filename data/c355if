I always make it a point to ask their thoughts on the global market. So this is derived from those answers. I don't trade big, bro. \n\nThe Position: 50% of total investment in stock, leveraged junior gold miners ETF $JNUG and 50% on ITM $USO calls expiring December 2019.\n\nThe fundamentals: \n1- To spite of what you might read, the physical crude market is tight. The price of crude has mainly been suppressed by fears of slowing global economy and the US-China \u201dtrade war\u201d. \n \n2- IMO2020 is a global mandate that ships will have to burn low sulfur fuel to remain compliant. This will tap into the retail fuels market and render residual fuel oil less profitable due to the need for scrubbing. This will add demand and decrease usable retail supply.\n\n3- Gold has always been the \u201dgo to\u201d when the economy goes to shit.\n\n4- Irans economy has gone to shit so they are blowing shit up.\n\n5- China is threatening to cut off rare earth metals exports to US if trade tariffs continue.\n\nHere is my take. 1 of 3 things are going to happen. \n\n1-No agreement is reached and the \u201dtrade war\u201d continues, keeping fuel prices suppressed and raising the value of gold/mining companies in the near term. Fuel prices don't drop much due to the coming IMO2020 risk and the fact that Iran is shooting down drones (which also helps $JNUG) You close both positions making a profit on $JNUG and losing little if anything on $USO calls.\n\n2- No agreement is reached and the \u201dtrade war\u201d continues, keeping fuel prices suppressed for now. China doesn't cut off rare earth metal exports so position doesn't change much... until Iran blows something else up. That coupled with the IMO2020 squeeze causes oil prices to go way up around October. $USO call premiums go way up, closing midferm with a profit in calls and slight loss if at all on $JNUG (because Iran blowing drones up helps $JNUG). \n\n3- An agreement is reached and oil prices go up in the near term. Iran continues blowing stuff up which helps both positions and the IMO2020 squeeze causes fuel prices to go up even higher, tipping the market into a recession. Now we\u2019re at war, gas prices are sky high and the stock market is crashing... but at least both positions increased nicely and you close long term with sick tendies just in time for Christmas.\n\nIn conclusion, I think strategy hedges against risk of loss nicely while holding huge upside potential.", "created_utc": 1561085397, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c355if/tradewariran_blowing_stuff_upimo2020_nice/", "is_self": true}
