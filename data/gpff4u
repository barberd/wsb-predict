Not a pump and dump though, this is a legitimate company with a bright future. I lost a bunch on tankers, and cried as the stock I sold to buy NAT/EURN stocks blew up (DKNG). Finally pulled out and had tendies to put somewhere. And I found GNUS which is almost guaranteed to blow. \n\nDisclaimer: This is the only penny stock I\u2019ve bought and I am not a pump and dumper, if you check my post history I only have 1 post in penny stocks.\n\nThe company makes children\u2019s tv shows and merchandise (1 to 11 years old)\n\nThey have their own network (Kartoon Channel) set to debut June 15. They have partnered with Netflix, Amazon, YouTube and Ali fucking Baba.\n\nThey already have good quality shows such as Llama llama (currently on Netflix and a best selling book and mom is voice acted by Jennifer Garner), Rainbow Rangers etc.\n\nIn August they will be dropping a bunch of merchandise made my Mattell. They will be selling them at Walmart & Amazon amongst other places. This will be where most of their money will come from.\n\nThey have a big show coming in Spring of 2021. It is Stan Lee\u2019s last project before he passed. He will appear in every episode along with Arnold Swarzenger voicing the teacher. He teaches 6 kids that have superpowers. Looks pretty cool, please look at link below.\n\nhttps://ql.mediasilo.com/#ql/5dcb52efe4b09a68f814db86/b51d0709-288b-4be9-8e1e-cf5f4d6de866\n\nThe channel is free, they will make their money from ad revenue. Some of their other shows have celebrity partners as well, though I don\u2019t know how much kids will care about them (Warren Buffet, Martha Stewart, Dolly Parton etc) But all of their shows are woke af and their tag line is programming with a purpose. Nothing offensive and kids learn something so parents will approve. \n\nTheir CEO (Andy Heyward) has produced a bunch of hit shows such as Inspector gadget, \nCare Bears, Strawberry Shortcake) etc.\n\nThey recently had an offering of 6 million shares for $1.30, so there is a lot of support at that level. With all the catalysts above this stock will be much higher by June and August. I have over 5000 shares and will likely be adding more.", "created_utc": 1590277956.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gpff4u/gnus_is_about_to_pop/", "is_self": true}
