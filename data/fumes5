Unfortunately, I may be following suit unwittingly, despite getting some solid gains for the first couple weeks of my foray into this game.\n\nBought 4/17 $43 AZN puts near EOD today at .85, and they immediately crapped out to .01. Can somebody please shed some light into why the fuck this happened??\n\nI am confused and don\u2019t want to be wallowing all weekend when I have other plays that are still looking up, and am more bullish than most on the whole bat flu situation. Really hoping it\u2019s RH being autistic here and not me.\n\nThanks retards!", "created_utc": 1585970220.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fumes5/wtf_happened_here/", "is_self": true}
