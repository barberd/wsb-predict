{"id": "fsp8yf", "title": "TEVA on TV, call options for thee", "selftext": "Trump name dropped TEVA about 5 times during the press conference after hours yesterday stating TEVA was slotted to provide 8 million \u201cdoses\u201d of generic chloroquine to distribute to hospitals. I\u2019ve only ever worked a few places in my life but one was in a pharmacy and another was for the US government.\n\nTEVA produces these drugs for next to nothing, made in a giant vat and chopped up into pill form for distribution. The cheapest place you can buy a bottle of 30 tablets is Walmart for around 75 dollars.\n\nTo do some quick math we have a few options: 8,000,000/30 per bottle= 266,666x$75 = 20 million dollars. That\u2019s the low end.\n\nKnowing the government, they\u2019ll pay more. Probably a lot more. An X factor to throw into the mix is that Trump mentioned \u201cdoses\u201d. Ordinarily for Malaria prevention/recovery a patient would take chloroquine for at least a week. A dose in this case could be 7-10 tablets per person. If that\u2019s the case, we\u2019re not talking 8 million tablets, that\u2019s 56 million. More math: 56,000,000/30 per bottle = 1,866,666 bottles at a MINIMUM $75 per bottle: $140 million dollar USG contract for something that probably costs them about tree fiddy to make.\n\nTEVA doesn\u2019t only make chloroquine, they also provide generics for about every old boomer condition you can think of: Statins, depression meds, thyoid meds, you name it. Considering the only places that are open right now are Wendy's drive thru, pharmacies, and some big navy boat hospital bois, they're still making money right now. \n\nOh, and did I mention their earnings report is 4/30? Full speed ahead, TEVA 5/1 12c.\n\nAlso Spy 5/1 190p because duh.", "created_utc": 1585702087.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fsp8yf/teva_on_tv_call_options_for_thee/", "is_self": true}
