{"id": "f8bng0", "title": "Greek Treasuries: A Symptom Of A Global Hunt For Yield On The Brink", "selftext": "One thing I have been noticing over the past couple months is the fact that Greek 10 yrs are yielding sub 1%. To most who have been desensitized by the global hunt for yield, this doesn\u2019t mean much but we need to look at how we got to this point. Yields on a Greek 10 year note reached highs back in June of 2012 at 24.32% and have since plummeted below 1%. Investors have been forced to find yield amongst a euro landscape of negative yields where a staggering $10 Trillion of euro zone debt is negative yielding. Investors have been forced to expose themselves anywhere yield can be found regardless of quality or risk. As it stands, Greece\u2019s national debt still sits at 180% of its total annual economic output. Greece\u2019s unemployment also sits around 16.5% matching levels seen back in 2011. To put this into context, U.S. 10 yr treasuries yield 1.46% and the United States has an unemployment level of 3.6% and debt to GDP at 107%. Investors are ignoring risk in favour of capturing any form of yield. If a \u2018black swan\u2019 event were to occur, we could see this all unwind with dramatic consequences globally.", "created_utc": 1582475161, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8bng0/greek_treasuries_a_symptom_of_a_global_hunt_for/", "is_self": true}
