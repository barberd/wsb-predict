I buy 1 morgan stanley call because they were looking good imo. I wake up to their ER and my fucking badass little call made me $350, it was a 300% gain. I fucking locked in that fucker and felt great for the rest of the day, divied up my portfolio and I decide to try puts with my gains. I buy a few puts and low and fucking behold, my big boy gains went down the drain by friday. So that friday (last friday) I decide well fuck, epidemics are scary so i'll just go in on SPY puts. Monday was great, I coulda locked in a 30% gain on it, but no I got fucking greedy and decided to hold for the big dip on tuesday. I spend literally 14 hours straight watching the futures rise and fall until the market opened green and I fucking blew it. I freak out for the rest of the day and browse wsb until I made a realization. The only problem i'm having is that I bought fucking piece of shit puts in a Fed Market.\n\nSo this morning I see AMD dropping like 10 billions and I decide to do it, I bought the fucking dip. That 1/31 call made me $100 fucking dollars by the end of the day. \n\nAnd there you have it, i'm never buying puts again. Why the fuck would anyone in their right mind put money on value going down, while the fed is putting your money on value going up, it's fucking nonsense. \n\nI got fucked by the fed's giant swinging bulldozer bull dick and it changed me as a human being.\n\nOnly calls from here on out, because in this fed market the stonks ONLY go UP!", "created_utc": 1580352666, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/evyetf/year_of_the_fed/", "is_self": true}
