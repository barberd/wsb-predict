{"id": "fch3wg", "title": "Aggressive/Unusual Options - DIS/UBER/BIG/TWTR/WMT", "selftext": "Today     I included the aggressive  orders that I see, many of them instead  of     just a few into one picture.  Today I didn't color code the   calls/puts     but did color code the  companies.\n\nThese     options orders  are on or above the ask. Many have the same expiry   and   strike. Also lots  of the orders were sweeps so these ppl were    breaking  down their order  to get filled faster.\n\nAlso     all  these orders volume of the contracts exceeded the open interest    in   multiple trades so it's most likely not closing positions.  Either    buy     to  open orders or sell to open orders and based on  the    aggressiveness  of the orders one can infer its buy to open. Some  of     these may be    hedges  and some most likely not.\n\nData is here - [https://ibb.co/XSmzzvk](https://ibb.co/XSmzzvk)\n\nThis is just some of today's orders, i know it is late in the day but I am doing the best I can do right now to post these.\n\nThe DIS puts are VERY bearish, watch that. The BIG/TWTR Calls look decent, DIS looks strong on the puts.\n\nI    will say this, don't just enter YOLO's in positions based on this  data        alone in most cases. Use  technicals/fundamentals/options      data-flow/market  sediment all combined  instead of just 1 of these.  Use        protection like  spreads if you worry  about losing what u  put in     and    be  smart,  understand the risks of putting  $ into  weekly     expiry's, consider a longer expiry.\n\nAlso with the market going lower use technicals/fundamentals/options   data-flow/market  sediment all combined.\n\nI wanted to add, 50 Cent VIX trader ruffer llp (or whatever) is still holding most of their vix calls today", "created_utc": 1583176054, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fch3wg/aggressiveunusual_options_disuberbigtwtrwmt/", "is_self": true}
