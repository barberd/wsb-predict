{"id": "ei8hd4", "title": "Am I retarted or is this a good short term play?", "selftext": "Hey fellow degenerates, I traded literally the first time today, and I have essentially zero trading experience, but based on the shitty DDs that are written up here, and the fact that it's fucking Wall Street bets, this counts as a DD. Albeit a shitty one. Here goes. I have a low level tendie printing opportunity for y'all. \n\nI am Canadian (Can't use Robinhood.... sigh), and idk if Robinhood trades TSX, but if you can trade Canadian stocks, this so for you. \n\nThe play: buying short term puts on $CNQ:TSX \n\nThe reasoning - First and foremost, the RSI and MACD indicate strongly that this stock will begin moving downwards. The RSI is above 70, moving downwards, and shows bearish divergence. As well, the MACD just had a crossover, and the histograms are starter to give large red bars. \n\nSecondly, the price point the stock is currently trading has been a resistance point in the past. The 42$ mark is about where it stopped about a year ago or so, before it trended downwards, and it appears to be doing the same now. Currently, there has been some slowing around 42, and it's just starting to trend downwards. \n\nThirdly, the stock just came off a strong earning report on December 20th, but analyst expected EPS for the next quarter are predicted to be lower than last quarter (for whatever reason, maybe Greta). The momentum from the last earnings report appears to be winding down and reversing. \n\nFinally, the IV of this stock is relatively low now, and it is a prime time to buy options, as IV should increase or stay the same going forward, if you're looking for an exit. \n\nThese factors are not factors that have anything to do with the long term prospects of the company, and just signal a trend going forward. In fact, the long term prospects of this stock appear to be very good from my basic read from other websites etc. but for now there could be small short play available. \n\nIf you look at the stock, it looks like it's just starting to trend downwards, and it could be a prime time to buy some put options. \n\nRisks: there could be a momentum reversal, and new buyers come in, and the stock could remain at 42$ or go higher, and the puts expire worthless. If it does go down, I doubt it will go super far into the 30s to 20s as analysts are very bullish long term on this stock, but there is definitely going to be trend downward, it's just a question of how long it will last, how far downwards it goes. \n\nI myself bought 1 contract, January 17 put at 40$ strike for 0.34$. TBH, it was my first trade ever, and if I wasn't a dumb idiot, I would have bought at the 42$ strike, for around 0.9$ but what can you do. Oh well. I don't trade w Robinhood, so I pay fees, and I will this keep my position. My account is relatively small, and I'm not gonna buy large amounts, (unlike the core wsb doctrine). People will call me a pussy, and to them I say, fuck you. Look at the flair, it says DD not YOLO, bitch.\n\nIf anyone wants to enlighten me as to why this is a terrible move, and I'll die early, people let me know.", "created_utc": 1577824671, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ei8hd4/am_i_retarted_or_is_this_a_good_short_term_play/", "is_self": true}
