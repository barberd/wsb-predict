Second to SLB.\n\n**22B TTM revenue is about 60M revenue every single day. This company is HUGE and has been around since 1919. They are not going anywhere.**\n\nFor Q1 2020, Halliburton reduced total debt by 500M and extended debt maturities out to 2030. By issuing 1B at 2.92% due March 2030 and redeeming 1.5B of notes ranging from 3.5-3.8% they also reduced their interest expenses. **This resulted in LT debt declining from 10.3 to 9.6B.** The early debt redemption resulted in a 168M loss on extinguishment. \n\nDuring the quarter, they spent 158M of cash for dividends. Surprisingly, they did not mention Q2 dividend guidance. The loss was a non-cash impairment and also included the 168M loss on extinguishment. **Adjusted net income excluding impairments and other charges was 270M or 31c/share**. Given all the craziness in Q1, they actually made money.\n\nSecond, they spent 100M for stock repurchases. The stock repurchase plan should be cut to 0 for Q2. Because of these actions, they were able to deleverage some debt but their cash on hand declined from 2.2B to 1.4B. Not a big deal since they have a **current Ratio of 2.0. THIS IS HUGE. They have massive LIQUIDITY for the next year to survive this environment.**\n\n**Of their 9.6B debt, only 11M is due this year, and 697M is due next year. 8B is due after 2024.** In 2019, they paid out ~630M of dividends to shareholders and purchased 100M of stock. These 2 are discretionary items. Maybe they cut their dividend and stop buybacks for a quarter?\n\n**53% of there revenue comes from North American companies like Exxon, Chevron, Devon, Hess, Occidental, Chesapeake and Pioneer. They also have contracts in the Middle East with Saudi Arabia's Aramco, Kuwait and Qatar.** 22% from Middle East/Asia, 10% Latin America, think Petrobras, and 15% from Europe/Africa.\n\n6.8B equity means they should be **valued at book value minimum of around ~8/share.**\n\nTrump also said he will aid the energy industry due to national security reasons. Guarantee some loans? A director also bought $3M worth of shares at 8.68 yesterday.\n\nSLB did 33B TTM revenue but has a market cap of 23B. HAL did 22B TTM revenue but only has a market cap of 7.8B. These should both be valued at a minimum P/S=1 when things get back to normal.\n\n**Expect HALLY above 20 early next year.**", "created_utc": 1587757084.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7f14i/halliburton_is_a_buy_thanks_dik_cheney/", "is_self": true}
