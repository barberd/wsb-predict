My question is if this buyout is valued at $65 a share why are we not seeing options premiums trading closer to there intrinsic values and the share price of APC not right at $65. Is this difference based on the chance that the buyout doesn\u2019t happen?", "created_utc": 1555103935, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bciz61/understanding_the_chevron_cvx_and_anadarko_apc/", "is_self": true}
