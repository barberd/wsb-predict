{"id": "f7zk4t", "title": "$SPCE going higher. See you poor bears at 50+", "selftext": "https://imgur.com/a/9iGtZpi\n\nLet\u2019s take a stroll down memory lane. Famed fake meat purveyor and beloved meme stonk of 2019, $BYND, experienced massive moves from May through July over two ERs then proceeded to cuck everyone after announcing a secondary. \n\nThis no moat nothingburger ran up to $14 billion market cap on the $1T worldwide meat TAM and a hail marry partnership from $MCD. If this $TSN assassin can pump 14B market cap then truly anything is possible. Buffet like moat. No one got a moat bigger than $SPCE. (Yes, I\u2019m all in SpaceX and Blue Origin whenever they list - but they probably gonna IPO via Wall Street and those bastards will suck up all the tendies.)\n\nEven if you don\u2019t believe in the $SPCE story recognize that $SPCE is the meme stonk of 2020. It doesn\u2019t even matter if you buy the story. By the time Sir BDB is done pumping his first flight we all gonna be eating space ship Cheerios. The noise has not even begun. Branson is the undisputed master showman of his generation. He\u2019s neck deep in aviation and knows exactly how to print money in that industry, not to mention virtually everyone he\u2019s been in. \n\nChamath, who is sitting on a cool $1B in $SPCE tendoids, is about to roll up to a 1 hr free HSN advertisement on CNBC\u2019s Squawk day after earnings. If you think this king maker gonna volunteer to take fire for an hr on live tv while his stonk crashes 20% you\u2019re already in space cause you ain\u2019t living on this planet. He knows the news is gonna be stellar. That\u2019s why he agreed to show up. He\u2019s gonna pump his bottom line another cool billion. I expect an announcement on first flight timeline and opening up reservations including a price hike auction system for first movers. \n\nInstitutional investors. Take a look at the millions of shares folks like Vanguard are buying up. These people have teams of PhD number monkeys figuring out whether or not they should get into something and put those somethings in their portfolios. Your (and my) baby DD ain\u2019t even in the same airspace. Just follow their money. \n\nWhy 50? For those of you who can\u2019t math you take the shares outstanding and multiply in by price per share. If you\u2019re like me you think of companies in terms of market cap. If you stick your finger in your mouth and hold it up in the air that feeling you\u2019re feeling is all the negative interest rate free central bank money sloshing around the world looking for a home. Hence 10B market cap for Virgin Galactic East. Ergo 50 per share. \n\nMedia blitz. Just getting warmed up:\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/tv/B83pn1-F4El/?igshid=wahwj4qsgjg7\n\nAnd finally, $BA needs a win. They already in for $20m which is basically toilet paper money for these aviation monopolists. These guys are chomping at the bit to own commercial space. Expect an announcement where $BA is contracted to builds a fleet of next gen $SPCE ships. \n\nIn short, long call $SPCE for free money. \n\nDisclaimer: I\u2019m in for about 5m+ in 2021 and 2022 leaps so my money is where my mouth is.
