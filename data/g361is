The general idea**\r\nAir Canada is basically the Bernie Sanders of Healthcare, but they are circulating through the loopholes of government taxation. He disappeared - because appearances are only shown when we are not truly busy. Just like airlines, or even the success of others.\r\nThis airline has recent contributions to aid the pandemic that is the COVID-19 virus. Which their active efforts is through the assistive measures of emptying the international flights of consumers; and their contaminative properties.\r\n\r\nI mean, they ripped out all the passenger seats to use it for cargo. \r\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-air-canada-converting-three-boeing-777s-to-cargo-only-2020-4\n\nThey also only suspend flights toward the plague of *passengers* within the commercial airlines for us commuters\r\nhttps://globalnews.ca/news/6812909/canadian-airlines-suspend-flights-coronavirus/\r\n\r\n\t**II. The most fluid general idea.**\r\nThe suspension of flights may not entirely go to waste or dip the problematic gestures for the lack of 'consumer' flights. Flight seats can range from person to person, which generates a lot of carbon emission. This carbon emission is the influx of kinetic energy for people to even get to the airport.\r\nThis is what frictions to what causes people to be layered away off work, as general businesses has shifted into a different track of essential expertise. \r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/g0q03v/air_canada_suspends_international_flights_until/\r\n\r\n\t**III. It is a lot like building blocks.**\r\nHowever. Business is resumed as normal; on paper. Employees are kept on; planes are being used toward the growing new direction of the present economy. \r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/fx86n6/air_canada_to_rehire_16500_laidoff_workers_with/\r\nUse your heads here guys, empty seats does not mean empty skies. Planes have other purposes than to deliver the noise of our masses. Bringing people back home from all directions are humanely and ambassador-like duties where blank cheques or favours are done in exchange to help during the crisis. In other words, Airlines still got paid to bring or send everyone home before the isolative closure.\r\n\r\n\t**4. Because we're too stupid to see the other side of the coin.**\r\nUsing the air for trade-relations or assistive deliveries of empty local and international skies to deliver goods such as masks to other areas of the world can be more beneficial in tax relief as an asset to society than as tool to 'amazon-ship' humanoids all across the globe. These \"sky-busses\" are what brings trade relations an important value and asset for Canada to have, as a \"Neutral\" country that can aid the relations of other countries provide more assistance. \r\n\r\n**The consumers are the boomers**\r\nWe have the everyday chumps such as these folks; https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/fxc3v1/is_air_canada_ac_out_of_the_woods_what_is/\r\nWhere boomers and non-boomers alike think it may be a good time to buy (AC) as the stock market \"simply\" had a reduction. Well, I'm sure we've had friends or family members ask for situational advice. Word of mouth is a lot slower than social media (Reddit). They are just a little slow to the party - which is where I say they are speculative boomers who have nothing to do but invest their newfound time wisely.", "created_utc": 1587143209.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g361is/wall_street_canadians_heres_why_acto_will_reach/", "is_self": true}
