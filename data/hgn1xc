The day after that...?", "selftext": "In this day and age, it's easy to press the transfer button and simply inject cash into your investing account.  \n\n\"Shit I'm only short like $70 for this trade, ill just transfer a little more.\"  \n\n\"If I buy this dip today, it'll bounce back tomorrow and I can make a killing.\"\n\nWhats a few small transfers right? Its only like $250 bucks. \n\nYada yada I'm sure you know where this is going. I've made alot of money in this market, and I've lost alot of money in this market. More recently, the latter. More specifically, I lost 80%. \n\nNow I'm not a complete autist. I haven't been gambling my rent money, but I was gambling money that I could have made real changes with. I could have reimbursed my family for the down payment they helped me put on my car. I could have taken a chunk out of my student loans. Most importantly though, I could have made sure that my younger brothers had the time of their life when they come to visit me next week. \"YoU dON't NeED MoNEy tO HAvE a gOoD tImE\" blah blah experiences and bonds. Bullshit. \n\nToday after I got off the phone with my brothers it sunk it. With the gainz I made in 3 months I could have spoiled the hell out of two kids have grown up nothing but poor as fuck. Now it's just a fuckin pipe dream. \n\nTomorrow I am liquidating all of my positions that are valued greater than $.05. I am going to buy the top investing books suggested by Investopedia (or suggestions you leave below) and am not putting anything back into the market until my brothers and gone and the books are finished.\n\nThe day after that? Idfk. TESLA 1500c? \n\nTLDR; You get numb throwing around thousands in the stock market to make your fortune someday in the future. Sometimes its good to take a step back and consider what that money could do for you today. \n\nLosing Positions if curious:\n\nFB 250c 7/2    PCG 13.5c 7/2     PCG 13c 7/17    PFE 39.5c 7/10    CNK 20c 7/17     IVR 14c 7/17     \n\nFLIR 45c 7/17   XLE 49c 8/21     RUTH 22.5c 8/21    BUD 65/75c 9/18   TWO 14c 9/18     IMAX 19c 9/18\n\nBLMN 20c 10/16    TAP 52.5c 10/16    DFEN 31c 10/16    ALK 52.5c 10/16", "created_utc": 1593231920.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hgn1xc/today_i_got_a_reality_check_tomorrow_i_am/", "is_self": true}
