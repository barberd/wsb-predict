Well, hold on to your dicks, because I'm about to blow them the fuck off. Here's the DD:\n\nAs we know, the kids on wall street are little trust fund fucks that mostly exist due to nepotism. They don't know how businesses, markets, or numbers work. This drives our economy, and we know this.\n\nNow, on some days, these fuckbois pound adderall. On these days, they get anxious and also temporarily gain enough brain power to realize that numbers are meaningless and all business-leaders are incompetent. On these days, they panic offload.\n\nOn other days, they pound xanax. As you know, Xanax has a strong \"boomer brain\" side-effect, where you could literally look at a housefire and think \"wow I love the crown molding, let's check out the basement.\" On these days, fuckbois buy worry-free. The uptick in XNX has led to one of the biggest bull runs in history over the past 10 years.\n\nIn a nutshell: You can predict whether the market will go up or down by the A/X ratio, or the adderall-to-xanax ratio. A high A/X ratio, where more floor traders are taking adderall than xanax, leads to a bear run (and vice versa). This is colloquially referred to as the \"fuckboi quotient.\"\n\nSo, what is going on, then? Well, you see, the fuckboi quotient historically tracks individual traders. So, for example, a fuckboi quotient of 2 might mean that 200 floor traders are pounding adderall, while 100 floor traders are pounding xanax. Through this, you can accurately predict a bear run.\n\nHERE'S THE PROBLEM:  The fuckboi quotient has been sitting at \"1\" for 2 days. Now, you might think this means that there are an equal amount of each, leading to a relatively flat day. But, no no no. In panic, the Wall Street fuckbois are all pounding BOTH xanax and adderall at the same time, which means that this A/X ratio of \"1\" is essentially broken. It's leading to a phenomenon I call \"relaxed panic,\" which explains why TSLA is mooning literally the morning their main factory gets shut down.\n\nSo my advice? Ignore the A/X rating completely and buy literally anything, as both puts and calls will print at some point each day. \n\nThanks and please buy my ebook.", "created_utc": 1584707286.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flu71e/the_ax_ratio_is_no_longer_accurate_and_you_need/", "is_self": true}
