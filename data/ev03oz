A lot of people ask us on a daily basis \u201cwhat stocks do you like.\u201d \u201cIs the market going to keep goin?\u201d Through this newsletter we will attempt to guide you through the ups and downs of the market and help you block out the \u201cnoise\u201d on a day to day basis in order to grow your portfolio.   NOW... let\u2019s provide you with some market data.. S&amp;P 500 steadily has been rising since the 2008 Crisis averaging approximately 10% a year. In 2019 the SPY was us 29% (3X the normal return). With a lot of factors going into the 2020 year of the market we believe the art of stock picking will be of essence. Hedge Funds have been on the steady decline due to the \u201cMelt up\u201d in the SPY. With Volitlity current at historic lows is has been difficult for \u201clong short\u201d hedge funds to outperform the market.   We  have been accumulating a \u201csignificant\u201d amount of silver here. We believe central banks around the world will continue to cut rates leading the gold/silver rally higher. We are suggesting a 10% of portfolio in Gold and or Silver. Historically silver outperforms gold at about a 3:1 ratio we are taking silver as a beta trade.. Some other silver mining stocks if your looking to get even more beta are AG, PAAS, EXK, ABX, MUX, NG, SAND, NEM.    (https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/now-everyone-pays-piper-end-chinas-economic-miracle)  \n\nWhich leads us to our \u201cBlack Swan\u201d theory. The market has been going parabolic trading off China trade tariffs, new pension money coming into the index\u2019s, low interest rates, low volatility, and politically we believe the market has priced in trump winning in 2020. With earnings season right around the corner we will see if guidance lives up to expectations.  Some of the names we are in are.   NBL (Nobel Energy).  AG-(First Majestic)   XOM (Exxon Mobile)   Spec stocks we like: VUZI, MBII, BHVN, TXMD, ABEO, ORGS, MUX, PTON, CGC, ACB, GWPH.", "created_utc": 1580183503, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ev03oz/interesting_newsletter_i_was_sent/", "is_self": true}
