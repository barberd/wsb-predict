It is growing very slowly. \n\nHowever, the market is significantly underpricing the potential impact of weak semis these past couple quarters on HPE's gross margins. I got this idea from a fund manager I know, and he sees 50+% upside potential over the next year.\n\nAlso, the option chain is dirt cheap, pricing very little IV.
