{"id": "ds6nje", "title": "Using GUH effectively to actually make money", "selftext": "There have been several posts showcasing the RH glitch and all of them use the glitch to generate cash on margin and then YOLO the cash on various plays that never work out for anyone other than theta gang. It is kind of sad to see RH just giving away money and instead of pocketing an easy $10k-$50k, everyone is YOLOing that in hopes of making it a million $$ that they will likely be unable to cash out anyway. Maybe there are some people already doing this and just keeping quiet about it, but it feels like RH isn't taking this glitch as serious as it is, seeing as how people have been doing it for two days now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFull disclaimer: I do not recommend anyone take this route because I'm not familiar with what laws it breaks, but I figure if you are willing to leverage up 250x on RH's dime and then YOLO $50k of their money then you likely wouldn't be against just pocketing that $50k instead. You would need a second account with some money in it in order to pull this off, preferably at a different brokerage. However if you had a second RH account you could use the glitch on both sides to multiply the effect, but it would be less likely that you end up with the cash.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat being said lets jump into our new trading strategy. As you have seen on many of the other GUH plays, the end result is that RH autoliquidates your leveraged up positions as soon as possible after they notice it to \"manage risk\" on their side of things. So who profits when RH firesales your shit at the current bid/ask, that's right the market makers. By stepping into the role of market maker on your other account, you can be the one who profits instead. You will likely need a stock/option with a large spread to pull it off effectively, but a smaller spread would work as well. You just need to be sure you are selling to yourself.\n\n1. Use your favorite GUH method to generate cash without using up leverage, TSLA covered $5 strikes seem to be a favorite, but really you could use anything. \n   1. a. (Optional) If you are broke and therefore using two RH accounts each with $100 in each, then you will have to repeat step 1 to leverage up the second account as well.\n2. Using your favorite high spread option/stock, place a sell order in your market maker account for .01 under the current ask. If the bid/ask spread is 15.50/16 then you would place a sell order at 15.99 for however many shares you are comfortable with based on your personal risk preferences. Then on the first account you would buy those shares at 15.99 each. You will be long shares on one account and short on the other. Then on the market maker account you would put in an order for .01 above the bid for the same number of shares. In this case it would be 15.51.\n3. ?????\n4. We aren't really sure what is going on at RH, so we can't go too in depth as to what happens in step 3, but I'm assuming the priority escalates at RH depending on how many times step 1 is repeated. You basically want to repeat steps 1 and 2 until RH starts to liquidate your positions - into your open orders on your other account. From here you would be closing out your short positions and profiting slightly less than the current spread.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain I do not recommend attempting this, but it would be interesting to see if this would work assuming RH didn't patch the glitch yet. It also relies on RH not going after you for your negative RH balance afterwards, which many have speculated that they would be unable to collect on due to their failures at following Reg-T requirements.", "created_utc": 1572992665, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ds6nje/using_guh_effectively_to_actually_make_money/", "is_self": true}
