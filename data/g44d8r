The rapid economic downturn and JPows printer jumped in hard and fast, providing liquidity for markets. That solved an issue that was a big force driving the sell off and has been a huge source of anxiety of the markets pre/corona. If you think corona was the only thing that produced multiple circuit breakers in March than you are stupid and there\u2019s no help. \n\n2) People really do believe that the fundamentals of the world economy and international market systems are not on par with 2008, which was a real financial crisis of epic proportions. Not just the flu with paranoia as a symptom. A leading component of the massive March sell-off was the idea that a recession was in order. But there\u2019s little evidence to suggest that a genuine recession is about to happen. this will be a quick recovery. Aka not really a recession. I\u2019ve driven by multiple car dealerships in the past few days and you know what they are advertising? 64-80 months of 0% APR on cars. What does that tell you? People think that once the virus has calmed down, people are going to go bananas over lower interest rates and start buying shit like crazy. \n\n3) In sum, the virus is overblown and the Fed\u2019s actions have, inadvertently, helped continue a massive bull run. They\u2019ve solved the liquidity crisis that came with the Fed\u2019s plans to roll back QE and repo in April (originally proposed in beginning of Feb, before the virus really hit american markets) and the market panic of March. \n\nSo what we might be seeing is the groundwork being laid for another bull run and a massive bubble. \nV shaped recovery. \n\n***Bear case*** \n\n1) the virus is actually quite bad and opening up the economy will not immediately result in everyone having their jobs back. If the economy even opens back up. Huge unemployment numbers plus the Fed\u2019s desire to reduce the levels of QE and Repo and Bond purchases, will re-introduce the liquidity issue, which combined with huge unemployment numbers, will result in another leg down. \n\n2) solvency issues. How many companies are about to go bankrupt? If movie theaters cannot open until the fall, then Hollywood is down the shitter. Just think about all of those companies with terrible balance sheets, debt that they cannot pay back, negative cash flow (cough Seaworld cough), we will see sectors of the economy, and the millions of jobs attached to them, drop like a lead ballon. \n\nConclusion: \n\nBull case; coronavirus induced massive and unprecedented action by the Fed, which has inadvertently given new legs for another bull run. That\u2019s all premised on most of the economy and most people getting back to work, having money, and being able to buy cars, max our credit cards, get loans, and buy homes, at historically retarded low interest levels. \n\nBear case: Certain industries are beyond fucked and they will tank, and when they tank, unemployment will continue to stay high, which means no one will be able to take advantage of historically low levels of interest rates. They won\u2019t be buying shit cause they got no jobs. Which will result in loan defaults and a real financial crisis. \n\nI\u2019m leaning toward the bear case this week. But I know JPow and his unlimited printers will come out with something novel and unprecedented which will give rise to another short term bull run. \n\nBut it all depends on if people will actually get their jobs back. Unemployment numbers haven\u2019t tanked the market yet, but that moment is coming, I think. You cannot have these levels of unemployment and markets rising forever. Unless we reopen big and soon. \n\nThoughts?\n\nPositions: your mom, doggy style.
