I'm hoping this will grab Chase's attention.  \nTO CHASE: I called while this was happening (left on hold by CS rep until market close), left a phone complaint with a researcher after it happened, then left a secure message on your webportal the day after. This is my last resort.\n\n\nI got into options because of the volatile market, did my due diligence. I signed up with Chase JPM as my brokerage: big mistake.\n\nLong story short, I bought some SNAP calls and NOK Puts during late March.  Later, both options shot straight up in value, SNAP call at \\~5000%, and the NOK put at \\~$8000 %, totaling in around $25,000 in profits. Price per contract when I bought: SNAP 0.16 NOK 0.06. Day contract price shooting up was March 23rd.\n\nPicture Evidence: [Imgur Snapshot of My Youinvest](https://imgur.com/gallery/YztbkaK)\n\nPicture of purchase receipt: https://imgur.com/gallery/lrNh9Hy\n\nI tried to submit the order to Close, but Chase YouInvest gives me a message saying\n\n\"Due to the Large Amount Orders Rule, your order will be reviewed.\"\n\nGuess what? They kept it under review status all day long, and eventually the contracts expired worthless.\n\nSo I called customer support to ask them about this review process, and they said\"Any Options orders that total in $5000 in transactions must be reviewed by our team\".\n\nThey refused to lift the review policy from my account, and 2 weeks since the incident still have not heard back about the $25000 loss.\n\nDo not use YouInvest. I\u2019m relatively new to stocks and options but this seems pretty close to fraud to me.", "created_utc": 1586211182.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fw87dw/lost_25000_because_chase_youinvest_is_pretty_much/", "is_self": true}
