Apparently he was Italian. I'm still working out the details. \n\n\nANYWAY, HERE'S THE REAL DD: I keep seeing references to \"the Ides of March\" in my research. This seems to be a reference to March 15th. Once I figure out what happened to this Julian guy on March 15th, I will have cracked the code. \n\nFor now, I'm in on $8 puts for 4/17.\n\nTL;DR -- Beware the Ides of March.
