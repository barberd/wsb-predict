{"id": "ddde6r", "title": "ATVI Pt. 3: THE CANCELLED PRE-ORDER", "selftext": "*TL:DR: ATVI Finna get REKT this month see spoonfed trades at the bottom.*\n\n**We're going to jump right into it.** [**Previous thread**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cti6rb/classic_wow_the_numbers_atvi_50_incoming/)\n\n**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_**\n\nSo ATVI hit 55$, earnings season is dropping soon and Modern Warfare is all over the internet in beta.\n\n**First off Let's talk Classic Wow:**\n\nClassic Wow is and was about as successful as I expected before blizzard cut the API supporting the census addons it was looking like more than 3 million subs were added. That's a lot of dough but just as I thought 2 weeks in majority of my friends who were dying of excitement to raid talking about how they were going to rule azeroth dropped off in the level 20's. The game is just way too hard and time-consuming for your average gamer nowadays, I estimate they will keep a solid 2 million subscriptions for the first 6 months and that it will stabilize in the 500k-1Mil range.\n\n**Overall, it was a great success** \n\nThey just made probably close to 100 million dollars re-launching a game over a decade old. The game is just a passive income drip to the exec's now and it is likely to forever remain that. I don't think they're going to fuck this up it'll be around for years now and likely we'll see talk of a BC classic server in a few years from now. Not to mention a TON of people went over to BFA after realizing they like WoW but actually are casual scrubs now that want to play retail.\n\n**So why do I think they're about to get rekt? 1 word COD**\n\nI bought Modern Warfare pre-order, I was super hyped all the footage and interviews were touting a game that was actually a genuine revival of the cult-classic and people were actually calling it the best COD they've ever played. Flash forward to today and I've canceled my pre-order as of a week ago. \n\n**The shitstorm is coming Randy...**\n\nI follow a decent selection of youtube gaming commenters, this gives me a complete picture of the \"buzz\" in gaming circles and right now ALL OF THEM, are dropping videos about modern warfare and activisions decision to literally lock out an entire mode from PC &amp; XBOX for a year. Personally, when I heard the news I instantly canceled my pre-order not because I didn't enjoy the game, **DEADASS it was the best cod I have ever played in my entire life period.**\n\n**Me and a metric-fuck-ton of gamers have drawn a line in the sand with these AAA publishers though.**\n\nThis is not going to fly and the PR backlash is going to be insane, KEEP IN MIND THIS IS GOOD FOR US. The stock price is going to drop in response to the wave of hate that is coming their way and I haven't even started talking about the lootboxes which are going to contain exclusive weapons **i.e. actual pay to win.**\n\n**If you remember the EA battlefront 2 fiasco over lootboxes, just know if ATVI doesn't stand down this is WORSE.**\n\nGamers are fucking tired of lootboxes, we don't give a shit if you want to charge us for skins we will gladly pay for them as evident by the many skins I own in a wide variety of games. The major difference here is the Gambling randomness, NO ONE except the whales likes the idea of boxes containing actual weapons that can give you an advantage over other players even if just statistical. This shit is going to prematurely-bukkake all over their faces like a room full of sweaty Japanese nerds on their first day shooting porn.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**\"Okay, that was a lot of Sweaty DD where are the tendies?\"**\n\nEarnings will release, the numbers will show low and be-hold literally nothing the internet says matters because Stacy is going to buy her son Call of Duty anyway it's the only fucking game she knows the name of, big fucking surprise.\n\nPrice will spike on the amazing sales report from COD &amp; WoW &amp; All the other parts of ATVI that no one knows are really producing them money like fucking candy crush. **The investors don't give a flying fuck what some salty gamers think, but they do follow the news, bad news scares them, good numbers make them happy.**\n\n**Spoonfed Trades:**\n\nATVI stock price will drop in response to the backlash coming in the next few weeks,\n\n**Buy puts ASAP if you are Bear gang.**\n\n*Nov. 8th 2019, 50$ Put's* &lt;- ^(I won't be buying any of these as I don't fuck with puts my testicles are rather minuscule.)\n\n**FUCKING NOTE: ONLY when ATVI is at 50$ or lower do I suggest buying back in.**\n\nThe price will then stagnate until earnings a few weeks later this is the time to **buy calls if you are Bull gang.**\n\nFeb, 21, 2020 60$ Calls &lt;-^(After the PR shock to the Activision price, these will be dirt fucking cheap.)\n\n *^(This isn't financial advice blah blah, do your own DD, something something inverse wsb.)*", "created_utc": 1570222528, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ddde6r/atvi_pt_3_the_cancelled_preorder/", "is_self": true}
