{"id": "hh550t", "title": "TD AMERITRADE?", "selftext": "I recently moved over to TD Ameritrade to step up my game from Robinhood. Needless to say I'm impressed and also intimidated by all the options and information. What I can't wrap my head around is why there is so many platforms for the same thing? You have web-based thinkorswim, you have thinkorswim desktop version, regular TD ameritrade.com, and mobile (obviously). But there seems to be no rhyme or reason between all of these platforms all the interfaces are different they dont even resemble each other in the slightest. My question is, for people who use it TD Ameritrade what are you using primarily? And do you feel like its that much better than Robinhood? \n\n\nEdit: grammar", "created_utc": 1593304830.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hh550t/td_ameritrade/", "is_self": true}
