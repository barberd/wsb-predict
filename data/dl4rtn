Notice the blond lady who recently jumped the Goldman ship to join a hedge fund buying houses? She\u2019s responsible for about 0.5% of all issued CLOs, what\u2019s a CLO you ask? Well she wouldn\u2019t even let the actual words grace her lips in that talk. Not even willing to say \u201ccollateralized loan obligation\u201d under the fear that she\u2019s misheard as saying she\u2019s been issuing collateralized loan obligations, one of the primary causes of the 2008 crisis. Oh it\u2019s just a \u201cdebt vehicle\u201d nothing risky, meant to conveniently trade loans owned by BBB rated corporations.\n\nKeeping up? This lady jumped to a company buying 33 houses a day in the New York area after she issued a bunch of CLOs. These things are expected to go south In the next recession. Companies have been \u201cself inflicting\u201d their BBB credit ratings through M&amp;As (acquisitions), so that they can return sweet sweet revenue increase expectations to return shareholder value.\n\nSo here\u2019s the thing. What better way to create a crisis of \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d companies rather than issuing -as many CLOs as you can personally legally manage-. And then expecting the government to bail out the companies, causes inflation to skyrocket, and then join a hedge fund buying houses as a hedge against inflation. It\u2019s not enough to simply by a ticker or options on a ticker that already owns houses, after all that would be easily traceable, wouldn\u2019t it be better to be offered internal stock on a company that will profit majorly from your intentional setup to failures?\n\nTLDR; big money is expecting the govt to bail out BBB rated companies that have been practicing \u201cvertical integration\u201d through M&amp;A, driving up inflation and therefore the price of homes higher.", "created_utc": 1571682844, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dl4rtn/its_not_a_conspiracy_if_they_openly_admit_to_it/", "is_self": true}
