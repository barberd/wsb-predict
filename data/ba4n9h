Good morning and happy Saturday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty nicely in the market last week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead! :)\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 8th, 2019.\n\n# **Key data could end or defend recession fears as stocks notch best quarter in a decade  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/05/first-quarter-earnings-are-expected-to-be-lousy-but-stock-market-may-not-care.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The worst earnings season in nearly three years is about to begin, but stock strategists say the market should be able to look right past declining profits and continue to reach for all-time highs, as long as trade talks between the U.S. and China continue to show progress.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks were higher in the past week, on the prospect that the trade talks would ultimately lead to a deal that could end punitive tariffs and boost earnings growth. The S&amp;P 500 was up 2% for the week, at 2,892 and is just about 1.6% from its all-time high of 2,940, reached in September.\n*****\n&gt; Among the first major companies to report are J.P. Morgan Chaseand Wells Fargo, both on Friday. In addition to earnings, investors will be watching Wednesday for minutes from the last Fed meeting; CPI inflation data also on Wednesday; and any headlines on trade or the U.K.'s \"Brexit\" from the European Union.\n*****\n&gt; As for earnings, Refinitiv expects a 2.2% decline in first-quarter profits for the S&amp;P 500 companies, but those lower results are expected to be the trough. Earnings growth is projected to rebound to 2.8% in the second quarter and by as much as 9% in the fourth quarter. The first-quarter decline would be the first negative earnings period since the second quarter of 2016.\n*****\n&gt; \"The second, third and fourth quarter will show a rebound.That's supportive of higher equity prices,\" said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. \"I was thinking I'd like to see a record for the whole year, and it looks like we might do better than that.\"\n*****\n&gt; 'Picture much brighter'\nKeon said there are risks, including whether there really is a trade deal with China over the next couple of weeks and whether China's economy is really bottoming. \"Is the success of China's stimulus gong to to continue and spread to other countries? To me, the picture is much brighter than it was a couple months ago,\" he said.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said any number of factors could be the catalyst to push stocks to records, including earnings season, if companies beat lowered guidance and their outlooks are good. Stocks could also ride higher on a better outlook for the U.S. economy, after a batch of better data including Friday's March jobs report.\n*****\n&gt; \"I think maybe we end up getting to a new high sometime early in the second quarter, and then maybe we do some sideways moving in that 'sell in May' period,\" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. \"I think we confirm that 10th anniversary of this bull market by hitting a new all-time high. Then we digest some of those gains and move sideways for a bit and let some of those earnings catch up, and then maybe there's a year-end advance.\"\n*****\n&gt; Also in the week ahead, investors are watching for the minutes from the Fed's last meeting, scheduled to be released Wednesday afternoon. At that meeting, the Fed released revised forecasts, with no rate hikes now expected in 2019 and a slower growth outlook. The minutes should also show what Fed officials were considering when they decided to end the program to roll down their balance sheet, and bond traders are looking for clues on which type of Treasurys the Fed will hold in its balance sheet.\n*****\n&gt; On the data front, there are CPI consumer inflation data Wednesday and producer price inflation on Thursday. Both of these indexes should be closely watched since wage gains were muted in Friday's March jobs report, and strategists said they see no sign of inflation on the horizon. The Fed also sees below-trend inflation, so any unexpected change would be important.\n*****\n&gt; The U.K.'s effort to leave the European Union will continue to make headlines in the week ahead. The Council of the European Union meets Wednesday, and will consider the U.K.'s request to extend the Brexit deadline, originally this coming Friday.\n*****\n&gt; \"It could go in any number of directions. The thing we've been telling people is if it's a messy, hard Brexit, the big difference between now and three years ago is you'd get a big chunk of that safe haven flow into U.S. dollars,\" said Michael Schumacher, director, rate strategy at Wells Fargo. Schumacher said investors would be more inclined to move into the short end of the Treasury curve, rather than into German bunds, which have negative yields.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://finviz.com/publish/040619/sec_all_w1_083004598.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/9Z7p7DZ.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/rQjCEsm.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/Q8h2L9u.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/WCjpL7J.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2Oq8JH7.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8xco4wH.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hHSAskH.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JzMRlBz.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/I82v0MA.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/U8b3oeF.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/dD7Ware.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Big First Quarter Gains Undoubtedly Bullish\n\n&gt; Well the big gains of Q1 are in the books and after the nastiness in Q4 it\u2019s reassuring to see the \u201cSweet Spot\u201d of the 4-Year Presidential Election Cycle returning to form and delivering solid gains. The Sweet Spot of the 4-Year Cycle runs from Q4 of the Midterm Election Year through Q2 of the Pre-Election Year for with an average gain of 21.1% for the S&amp;P 500 over the 3-quarter span. The S&amp;P 500 gained 13.1% in 2019 Q1, but it lost 14.0% in 2018 Q4 and is still down -2.7% for the Sweet Spot so far.\n\n&gt; But, nevertheless, this type of gain for the S&amp;P 500 in Q1 is undoubtedly bullish. The S&amp;P 500\u2019s gain for 2019 Q1 is the 26th best quarterly gain for the index since 1930, 7thbest Q1 since 1949, largest Q1 gain since 1998 and the top quarterly gain since September 2009.\n\n&gt; As illustrated in the accompanying table the 44 prior times that the S&amp;P 500 was positive in Q1 since 1949 resulted in 40 full-year gains and 4 losses for an average gain of 16.2% and gains for the remaining 9 months of the year 38 times out of 44 year with an average gain of 8.6%. The 18 years with Q1 gains between 5.5% and 13.9% are all followed by full-year gains with the only blemish in geopolitically charged 1956.\n\n&gt; The big black mark came from Black Monday 1987. 1956 was mired by the Hungarian Revolution and the Soviet invasion as well as the Suez Crisis, the Second Arab-Israeli War. 2011 was hindered by the international sovereign debt crisis, the U.S. debt-ceiling crisis and the resulting downgrade of U.S. credit rating. The dotcom bubble popped in the year 2000. Tepid growth and earnings declines created a mini bear in 2015 that bottomed in February 2016. And finally, the 1980-1982 double-dip recessions put U.S. stocks in abear market throughout 1981 that ended in August 1982.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e6301c8ae06f2310edd15f6eaab41d81/tumblr_inline_ppazbd5h8c1spdppr_640.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Bespoke Report -- Second Quarter Chart Checkup\n\n&gt; Following big market moves like we have seen in the last six months, a number of market characteristics tend to change as some new leadership groups emerge and others fall by the wayside. In order to help get a better idea of what sectors and groups have been driving the market, in this week\u2019s Bespoke Report, we are providing a \u2018chart checkup\u2019 of all the S&amp;P 500 Industries as well as providing updates to some key market and economic charts that we feel are important to highlight.\n\n&gt; It was a banner week for US equities and a great encore to a strong first quarter. With the exception of the Dow (DIA), every major index ETF was up over 2%. Value outperformed growth across all three market caps, but the margin between the two was pretty narrow. Defensive sectors like Consumer Staples (XLP) and Utilities (XLU) actually saw modest declines this week, while Materials (XLB), Financials (XLF), Communication Services (XLC), and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) all rallied over 3%. In international markets, China (ASHR) surged over 7%, while Mexico (EWW) bounced over 5%. Australia (EWA) was the only country up less than 1%. Fixed income ETFs saw modest declines across the board.\n\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/matrix.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Jobs Growth Slows, But Only A Little Bit\n\n&gt; Today's job numbers beat expectations, with 196,000 jobs added and a small positive revision to the prior two months. On a rolling 3 month average, job creation fell to the lowest level in over a year, but only marginally. While jobs growth is still solid, it has cooled a bit. That isn't anything to worry about, but it is something to keep an eye on.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/040519-ESR-1.png))**\n\n&gt; Wage growth picked up dramatically last year, with 2016-2018's sideways movement in the year-over-year change of average wages paid surging. Over the last few months that growth has once again been moving sideways, albeit at a much higher rate of growth than we've seen for almost all of the current economic expansion.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/040519-ESR-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for April 5th, 2019** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 4.7.19** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke7h8_xvhbA))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$DAL** \n&gt; * **$JPM**\n&gt; * **$RAD** \n&gt; * **$WFC** \n&gt; * **$BBBY** \n&gt; * **$FAST** \n&gt; * **$NC** \n&gt; * **$MSM**\n&gt; * **$SJR** \n&gt; * **$INFY** \n&gt; * **$FRC** \n&gt; * **$WDFC** \n&gt; * **$APOG** \n&gt; * **$LNN** \n&gt; * **$PSMT** \n&gt; * **$SOL** \n&gt; * **$SLP** \n&gt; * **$CAAP** \n&gt; * **$LEGH** \n&gt; * **$SEAC** \n&gt; * **$TRNX**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/JzMRlBz.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/JaZlywy.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/SUFLDSR.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable earnings releases for the trading week beginning April 8th, 2019.\n\n* (**[CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS CALENDAR FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS](https://i.imgur.com/d3alVLi.png)**)\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.8.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.8.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.9.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/kpkkGcI.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.9.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/rfGRMdn.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.10.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/QOa4w3j.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.10.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cG0Iunm.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.11.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/rBVk3jo.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.11.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.12.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/InIhNzV.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.12.19 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Delta Air Lines, Inc. $57.73 \n&gt; **Delta Air Lines, Inc.
