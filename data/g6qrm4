{"id": "g6qrm4", "title": "Cheap Oil ETFs- You\u2019re doing it wrong", "selftext": "Earlier this week, many autists flogged to buy \u2018\u2019cheap oil that could only go up\u2019\u2019. $600 million flowed into the USO alone in just a day. But some people didn\u2019t really understand the underlying of their purchase, or they would not have made it.\n\nBy buying in at around $2.50, which seemed cheap historically, you were paying 30% above the NAV for a 70% position in June and July contracts at $20, plus the average contango of $18. This means paying 1.3 times oil at $38 (Futures plus contango) which is now worth $18 for June delivery. Seems cheap?\n\nHere is another way to look at it (please excuse some of the simplifications made for the autists):\nAn ETF like USO,  synthetically replicates the perfomance of oil by holding WTI future contracts. The front-month contract which converges with the spot WTI price automatically gets rolled at the end of each month to avoid physically holding barrels of oil at any point, which would increase the ETF costs.\n\nThis means that at the end of each month, the fund sells the front-end future to buy the back-end future (furthest-out). The market being currently in a contango, the front-end future contract is the cheapest and the back-end contract is the most expensive (the price increase corresponds roughly to the price of storage). This literally means that every month, the fund sells low and buys high, thus depreciating the value of the ETF (NAV). This is also one of the reasons why we saw high volatility (and downward pressure) right before the May futures expiry, as funds and traders rolled their longs.\n\nExample: We are in April, the underlying is composed of May and June Futures. Once at the end of April, to avoid delivery, the fund sells May futures and buys the July futures, at a $5 premium to May (due to the contango).\n\nBut what happens if there is a sudden rebound in oil prices\n\nBoth the front-end and the back-end contracts will gain in prices. Which means that the fund will sell the front-end month at a better price, but it will also buy the back-end month more expensive, thus erasing any gains. Even worse, the market being in a strong contango, the fund will pay more for the back-end month than it sold its front-end month, thus erasing value.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nYou\u2019re really only going to make money once the market structure changes and goes into backwardation. Maybe if someone nukes Saudi Arabia. But until this happens, your wife\u2019s boyfriend will continue preventing you from getting any tendies.", "created_utc": 1587662517.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6qrm4/cheap_oil_etfs_youre_doing_it_wrong/", "is_self": true}
