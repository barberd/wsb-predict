I think my win rate is about 5%. Terrible. And if I do win, I always sell it way too early.\n\nThink I need to take a step away from the markets. It\u2019s kind of driving me insane, and I\u2019m up to my neck in debt, which is further driving me to do desperate, super risky plays.  \n\nI\u2019ve been \u201ctrading\u201d options for about 3 years now, and I\u2019m down about $16k. \nJust the last couple of days, I\u2019m down about $500. Which I know doesn\u2019t sound like a lot to some of you, but it\u2019s significant to me. I make a pretty average salary of about $60k, but I\u2019m just blowing it all on retarded SPY plays, apartment rent, interest on CC\u2019s. \n\nI see everyone making huge gains and I want to join in on those tendies, but it\u2019s just been downhill for me. I\u2019ve tried trading services, read multiple books, listen to podcasts, watch videos. \nI\u2019ve poured a lot of energy into this, and it\u2019s a pretty shitty feeling knowing it\u2019s all amounted to a huge autistic liability. \n\nGUH", "created_utc": 1581372412, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f1xuy1/constantly_losing_money_due_to_spy_short_term/", "is_self": true}
