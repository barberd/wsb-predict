World stock market is worth around $90 trillion, 1/3 of the world stock market is worth about **$30 frigging trillion**.\n\n# Physical Destructive Power (Tsar Bomb)\n\nTo maximum fatality, Putin drop that shit on NYC, but even this bad ass mfker can kill only up to **7 million** people (see link below).\n\n[https://outrider.org/nuclear-weapons/interactive/bomb-blast/?airburst=true&bomb=3&lat=40.7648&location=New%20York%2C%20New%20York%2C%20United%20States&long=-73.9808](https://outrider.org/nuclear-weapons/interactive/bomb-blast/?airburst=true&bomb=3&lat=40.7648&location=New%20York%2C%20New%20York%2C%20United%20States&long=-73.9808)\n\n# Economic Destructive Power (Tsar Bomb)\n\nCan wipe out an entire city, but even the entire NYC real estate market is worth only **$800 billion**.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe Chinese have actually created the ultimate bioweapon that can kill 6x more than the most destructive nuclear weapon, the Tsar bomb, while doing at least 30x the economic damage.\n\n# DD\n\nUS will not sit idly by as China create an arsenal of the world's most destructive weapon through teaching bats the art of kung flu.
