I know that it's had an amazing run in the past few years (going from 2 to 30's) but I think it has significant upside for years to come. I suspect it will probably triple in market cap by the end of 2021.", "created_utc": 1573535944, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dv5dyg/something_that_always_amazes_me_about_amd_only_a/", "is_self": true}
