{"id": "ckvyid", "title": "UBEX partners with Yandex and 10 SSPs", "selftext": "The Ubex project has signed an agreement with the Yandex Advertising Network (YAN). The agreement foresees the display of ads from Ubex over all Yandex Advertising Network channels.\nThe agreement signed between Ubex and Yandex, the largest advertising network and equipment supplier in all of Russia and the CIS, marks an important milestone for the Ubex project. The conclusion of the agreement will allow all of Ubex\u2019s clients to display their ads over the Yandex Advertising Network.\nIn the near future, Ubex clients will have the ability of performing ordering operations inside the Yandex Advertising Network through the Trading Desk.\nThe Yandex Advertising Network (YAN) is an ad-serving platform that consists of websites, mobile apps, Smart TV apps, and videos. Ads from Yandex.Direct are served in ad blocks on these platforms.\n\nOnly quality web resources with high traffic can join the Yandex Advertising Network. Each resource that requests to join the Yandex Advertising Network must pass a multi-step moderation to ensure it complies with the Terms of Participation. Yandex does not allow web resources to join the Advertising Network if they publish low-quality content or were created solely to make money through ad placement.\nCurrently, the YAN audience comprises tens of millions of users and a large percent of them don not overlap with Yandex search users. Therefore, placing an ad on YAN websites will allow expanding audience coverage.\nThe Ubex project continues to develop as it signs more agreements with leading advertising networks and platforms to ensure greater coverage for its clients. We have signed eight more partnership agreements with different SSPs. We will be ready to share details next week. Stay tuned for more news and updates from Ubex.\n\n                                          Partnerships with SSPs\n\nThe Ubex project has successfully concluded 10 agreements with Supply Side Platforms for the provision of traffic volumes in various regions around the world.\nAfter the successful conclusion of an agreement with the Yandex Advertising Service, Ubex has concluded 10 more agreements with key SSPs to ensure large traffic volumes for users of the platform. The SSP platforms operate in every key region of the world and will provide the Ubex platform with full coverage of millions of users.\nThough Ubex cannot yet disclose the names of its partners due to agreement confidentiality clauses, the following are the volumes in displays that the new partners will be able to generate in various global regions:\nKorea only \u2014 70 Million / daily\nChina \u2014 1.1 Billion / daily\nRussia and the CIS \u2014 986 Million / daily\nNorth America \u2014 1.355 Billion / daily\nEuropean Economic Area (EEA) \u2014 202 Million / daily + 150k QPS (queries per second)\nEurope, Middle East &amp; Africa (EMEA) \u2014 25k QPS\nSouth East Asia (SEA+APAC) \u2014 220 Million /daily + 105 QPS (APAC)\n\nThe conclusion of the agreements will ensure that the Ubex platform will have outstanding traffic volumes and will be able to ensure that all of its users will have global coverage in ad placement.\nThe Ubex project is currently conducting technical integration of the SSPs with which the agreements have been conclude. The integration period can take up to a month or a month a half to ensure successful operation. Once the SSPs have been fully connected, Ubex will be able to make use of the full range of network services of the SSPs. The names of the newly added SSPs will be disclosed in due time once technical integration has been successfully completed and the partners are providing quality traffic channels within the stated volumes.\n\n\nSource's\nhttps://www.ubex.com/\n\nhttps://medium.com/ubex/ubex-signs-agreement-with-yandex-advertising-network-20a0b922b39\n\nhttps://medium.com/ubex/ubex-concludes-agreements-with-key-ssps-bdf4f4e37808", "created_utc": 1564701410, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ckvyid/ubex_partners_with_yandex_and_10_ssps/", "is_self": true}
