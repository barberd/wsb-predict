Everyone is playing video games during COVID and getting a new headset to win at plunder on Modern Warfare:  Warzone.\n\n**Why July?**\n\nIt is extremely likely that $HEAR will make it into the Russell 2000 index if it simply holds most of its current value through earnings (let alone the pop everyone is expecting from guidance like Spring 2018 when PUBG/Fortnite caused an upsurge in headsets).\n\n[Russell 2000 reconstitution rank day](https://www.ftserussell.com/resources/russell-reconstitution) is May 8 (tomorrow!).  Don't think that ER wasn't specifically planned for May 7th because it was.\n\nTransitions in the ETFs and other funds following Russell 2000 are completed by June 26 when the index takes effect.   Between June 5 when preliminary list of Russell 2000 is released and June 26 when the index takes effect, loads of dollars MUST pour into $HEAR for the sake of tracking the index, regardless of where the stock is at.\n\nTherefore, 17 JUL calls (the premium isn't much more than 15 MAY and IV is much lower).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLong 17 JUL @ 10c, 12.5c, 17.5c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uhky85itrcx41.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c21036aff8c0e967d2ba42cc0089840ac45e6f3", "created_utc": 1588861514.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gf7i6v/why_you_should_play_hear_with_17_jul_instead_of/", "is_self": true}
