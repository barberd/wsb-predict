{"id": "eizk5a", "title": "My ACB Saga", "selftext": "I\u2019ve been so anxious all week. Coming off my Christmas Day high, and in my early morning delirium, I bought into those Coke partnership rumors and accidentally added an extra 0 to my order, which fulfilled before I could cancel.\n\nSo now I\u2019m in it. Thousands in at 2.07. I watched the price plummet almost immediately. Seems like it was indeed a pump and dump. Bottoming our at 1.91, I regretted everything.\n\n1/31, the cannabis sector rallies, and prices reach 2.05. I have no confidence and sell half my stake to minimize losses. I put the proceeds in SPY shares and calls. I\u2019ll hold the shares and the calls are up 40%. \n\nNow it\u2019s an hour before market open today. Prices skyrocket to 2.27. I am so ready to sell. Market opens. FUCKING TD AMERITRADE GOES DOWN.\n\nI spend the next half hour pulling my hair out trying to get an order in. Each time one does finally go through, the stock has already dropped .05 and its too late. TD Ameritrade support chat started, but radio silence on their end. Absolutely maddening.\n\nI finally made an educated guess and placed an order that filled at 2.10 a few minutes ago.\n\nWhat a fucking roller coaster. I\u2019m just glad I got off breaking even. Trading is hard and you guys are crazy. The lesson I learned from it all:\n\nBuY sPy CaLlS", "created_utc": 1577978744, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eizk5a/my_acb_saga/", "is_self": true}
