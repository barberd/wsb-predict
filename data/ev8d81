Only Toyota Nissan and Honda are managing to tread water.\n\nBut Tesla is going to be an exception this year for the auto industry.\n\nAfter coronavirus, we should see people frantically trying to buy cars because they don't want to take subways. People don't want to be in enclosed areas with thousands of other people. This fear will continue even after the virus is contained. They still need to get around though, and that's where cars come in. \n\nProblem is that having petrol cars, especially in major cities, comes with large costs that put off people from buying one. EV cars get around a lot of these costs. The biggest incentive is license plate quotas. In Shanghai and Beijing, license plates are on a lottery system and the cost can be almost as much as the car itself. Millions of people will want a car RIGHT NOW, they don't want to wait year after year to win the lotto and get a plate. They don't trust subways and buses, they are scared for the next epidemic, and they want a car as soon as possible. So what do they do?\n\n# They buy an EV.\n\nTesla is ahead of all other EV companies, even the ones in China. They've undercut NIO, their products are superior to products from BYD, and many of the models by Chinese car companies are built like compliance cars. The XPeng P7 may be able to compete on cost and value, but they don't have the capacity to supply cars to the millions of customers who want an EV this year. \n\nTesla has the supercharger network that they are ramping up this year in China. This is a huge advantage over other companies, because a Tesla owner can use both the supercharger network and the current charging network built by the government and third parties. Most people in China live in apartments, with limited access to charging at home so charging infrastructure matters more than most places.\n\nTesla will be building its own batteries. They don't have to worry about battery constraints as the other competitors do. They're going to be able to bring down the price of the most expensive part of an EV lower than their competitors can acquire, and it's going to get even lower. As scale of production ramps up, Tesla can increase its marginal revenue holding prices constant, because the cost of each Tesla they produce is going down. Labour costs are also cheaper in China. The more China slows down, the slower cost of labour goes up.\n\nThe price is right. $46,000 USD seems high, but millions of people in China spend that much just to buy a regular petrol car along with the price of the license plate. Large families (most likely to buy a car because they don't want their kids getting kung flu from the subway) pool their money for large purchases, enabling them to buy houses and cars without financing. \n\nOut of all EV car companies, Tesla will be the one on top.", "created_utc": 1580231981, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ev8d81/tesla_is_gonna_make_bank_in_china_and_its_because/", "is_self": true}
