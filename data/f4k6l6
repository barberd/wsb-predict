SPCE options, naturally, are worse. By the way SPCE's price action is going, and the 30% short, there will absolutely be a short squeeze. To how much? IDK but use 30-50% gains in a day on the underlying as a good reference. \n\nIf you actually paid good money for a real broker like TD or IB, you're fine. If you place market orders, you should probably be filled. \n\nAs for all the autismos who aren't willing to pay the equivalent .4 or .65 cent/share comission and use RH, you absolutely need to be aware that you might not be filled. Even some of my orders of 200 contracts at the ask price on QQQ aren't filled sometimes. I say this happens probably 3 out of 10 orders. \n\nTo resolve this, you can probably place 90-expiration limits and hope your order gets to the exchange soon enough. Obligatory RH and Citadel are shit and there will be a million REEEEEEEEEEEES here and on the RH subreddit when everyone tries to sell their calls at the tip of the squeeze.", "created_utc": 1581820651, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f4k6l6/psa_for_everyone_with_lots_of_spce_calls_on_rh/", "is_self": true}
