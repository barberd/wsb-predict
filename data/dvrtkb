I blame this on two things, people not sharing actual good DD and being retarded. \n\nSo I bring before you the opportunity to short Slack (WORK) for the same reason a lot of you shorted Uber a week back. These two companies have a lot in common, mostly by hemorrhaging money and being a being guided by the same Adam Neumann leadership style of \u201cpretend you know what you\u2019re doing\u201d. \n\nNow just like Uber, Slack has earnings coming up and their expiration for lockup in the same 2 week span (earnings 12/4, expiration 12/17). Just like Uber they\u2019re not profitable and are seeing lots of insider selling (half a billion worth in fact). Now the news cycle has yet to start reporting heavily on this like they did with Uber a week before these same events came up for them (they ended up falling &gt;15% in a couple days). I played their fall for a sweet 300% and plan to do the same for Slack. I\u2019m currently holding my entire portfolio in 12/20 Put @ $18. \n\nFull Disclosure: while I did make up 300% on Uber being a dumpster fire I am still down 40% on the all time. Also I am retarded. \n\nTL;DR buy Slack puts for mid/late December", "created_utc": 1573652018, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dvrtkb/slack_tendies_uber_crash_v2/", "is_self": true}
