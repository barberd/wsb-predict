{"id": "gaf8rr", "title": "Vaccine will not make SARS-CoV-2 disappear like everyone thinks it will", "selftext": " \n\nThis pre-print from Columbia University looks into the re-infection rate of other coronaviruses that the world has dealt with and compares the likelihood that someone who contracts a coronavirus will become immune to that specific virus and how long they are immune, 4 endemic (widespread and not going anywhere, e.g. HIV is endemic in Africa) coronaviruses were tested in NY from 2016-2018.\n\n[http://www.columbia.edu/\\~jls106/galanti\\_shaman\\_ms\\_supp.pdf](http://www.columbia.edu/~jls106/galanti_shaman_ms_supp.pdf)\n\n>During the study, 12 individuals tested positive multiple times for the same coronavirus. We found no significant difference between the probability of testing positive at least once and the probability of a recurrence for the beta-coronaviruses HKU1 and OC43 at 34 weeks after enrollment/first infection. We also found\u00a0no significant association between repeat infections and symptom severity\u00a0**but\u00a0strong association between symptom severity and belonging to the same family**\u201d\n\nQuick explanation: re-infections of coronaviruses are not unheard of within one year and your genetics might have a stronger impact on your symptoms than your immune system's memory from when you were last infected.\n\nThe layman's explanation of what they found in the study is that 3 of the 4 coronaviruses had repeated infections in patients in under a year, some patients re-contracted the virus within 4 weeks but the median was 37 weeks. So, in theory, they could be susceptible again in a month after having the virus.\n\n**But OP, that's why we're pumping the big bucks into a vaccine, vaccines fix this right?** Think again ya little turd monkey, vaccines are just dead viruses your body plays with so it knows what the real virus looks like when it comes around. It's like when your daddy gave you a carebear as kid so you could recognize you were just a big bear when you grew up. People who get chickenpox, for example, you can either get the disease and then you're immune or you get the vaccine and you're immune, either way, you don't get it twice. But with some things like the seasonal flu there's enough mutation that every year you need a new immunization because the virus is so different. In the paper they say they think it could be that genetic mutation \"*antigenic drift*\" or because of the host's immune system losing memory of the virus more rapidly.\n\n**But OP these are the other coronaviruses, how do we know SARS-CoV-2 will act like this?** We don't but this virus sucks in every possible way. This article suggests that they couldn't re-infect monkeys but they still have only been testing for a matter of months, so they're uncertain as to how long the immunity lasts:\n\n[https://www.euronews.com/2020/02/27/coronavirus-can-you-catch-covid-19-twice-euronews-answers](https://www.euronews.com/2020/02/27/coronavirus-can-you-catch-covid-19-twice-euronews-answers)\n\nThis other article says that while an antibody is produced in those who contract SARS-CoV-2 \"the antibody cannot last that long.\" and \" For many patients who have been cured, there is a likelihood of relapse.\"\n\n[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/02/19/coronavirus-after-2000-deaths-can-you-get-virus-again/4804905002/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/02/19/coronavirus-after-2000-deaths-can-you-get-virus-again/4804905002/)\n\nSome DD from a long time lurker, the email I got this information from is an NIH Group Leader.
