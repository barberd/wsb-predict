{"id": "ebifcn", "title": "The Real Real ($REAL)", "selftext": "The question is, is $REAL the REAL deal? \n\nThere's a bunch of upcoming Class Action Lawsuits because REAL supposedly didn't train their employees well enough on detecting fake Louis Vuitton Bags and Gucci Shoes and other expensive shit. I don't know who they are, but The Klein Law  Firm, Vincent Wong,  Levi &amp; Jorsinky are fighting on behalf of people who lost money on the company's stock. \n\nWhat do you guys think about the stock? It has extremely low trading volume compared to other stocks and the difference between the bid and the ask price on its options is high. On the $20 December 20 Put, Bid is $1.65 and Ask is $1.85 right now. Now that's improved. When I checked last time, the bid was $1.7 and Ask was $2.2. The stock barely moves. \n\nIs anyone here long/short in $REAL? What's your logic behind doing so?\n\nI'm 20$ Short Dec. 20. Currently losing 20.45%. Will not post my position. I'm ashamed. \n\nCheers!", "created_utc": 1576518457, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ebifcn/the_real_real_real/", "is_self": true}
