{"id": "beerhl", "title": "When and Where are your short options being Forced Closed early \u2013 a survey", "selftext": "So as many of you know, brokers automatically force a buy to close trade on your short option position that is still OTM on expiration day, if the strike is subjectively \u201cclose\u201d to being ITM (and you don\u2019t have the funds to afford the underlying should it get assigned). \n\nThis kind of policy is normal risk management for a broker and it makes sense why they do it. But it can be fucking annoying *and* expensive when it happens. \n\nThe most frustrating part though is the criteria of the broker\u2019s risk management policy is often really unclear (even when you ask). Specifically: \n\n* **What\u2019s the time cutoff: what time of day will a short position be automatically forced to buy and close it?** \n\n* **What\u2019s the OTM % distance cutoff : How far OTM does the strike need to be for the option to be considered safe from a force early close and the option is left alone and allowed to just expire worthless?** \n\n\nObviously these questions are valuable for many reasons.  In case not obvious, knowing this info you may choose different strikes when you open a spread, or another scenario is you can evaluate closing a short option position yourself early in the day when you see it trading cheap for a couple pennies and you think there\u2019s decent risk of the stock falling later that day (leaving the option still OTM in the afternoon but much more expensive at that time when you are forced to buy it).  \n\nIf enough people are interested in this and reply with info about their forced closed trades, we could get estimate the broker's forced to close policy criteria based on the data from everyone\u2019s replies.  \n \nHere is what I mean to start:  \n\n**Forced Close of Short Option:**  \n\n**Ticker: SPY**  \n**Option Strike: 288.5**\n\n**Time of Forced Close: 3:05pm**\n\n**Underlying price at time of close: 289.59**  \n\n**Distance OTM at time of close (in %): -0.38%** \n   \n**Price your broker forced your buy: 0.03**  \n\n**Number of contracts: 10**\n\n**Broker: Robinhood**\n\nThe last 3 data points aren\u2019t totally needed but helpful and interesting. Btw the formula for OTM percentage it just [(Strike \u2013 Underlying) / dividend by Underlying].  So (288.5-289.59)/289.59 =.0038. Yes this elementary school math everyone knows how to do this, but my opinion of my fellow retards on here is so low I figured I\u2019d explain it anyway.   \n\nI\u2019m not sure how many people on here with forced closed trades are interested in this, also replying does involve looking stuff up and we are all pretty lazy so my expectations are low. But I\u2019d rather no interest than trolls posting fake data.   \n\nFeel free to PM the info if you are a lurker and don\u2019t want to reply in the thread. Heck I\u2019ll even take a screenshot of the trade info for those too lazy to type.  \n \nHere\u2019s a blank template to make it easier:  \n\n**Ticker:**\n\n**Option Strike:**\n\n**Time of Forced Close:**\n\n**Underling price at time of close:**\n\n**Distance OTM at time of close (in %):**  \n\n**Price your broker forced your buy at:**\n\n**Number of contracts:**\n\n**Broker: Robinhood**\n\nThanks in advance fuckers.", "created_utc": 1555544795, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/beerhl/when_and_where_are_your_short_options_being/", "is_self": true}
