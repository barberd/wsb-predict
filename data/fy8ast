I have been on the lucky side of Dick & Dodd for many many years. First to understand DICK&DODD we must first understand that toxic CDO\u2019s in most cases never left the market. Most people like B before the AML maybe one of the worst transactions to ever happen. Did not understand the toxic nature of the tranches or shit ML was pitching in other words ML at something like .27 cents was a bad deal and huge loss. However as of Today the Fed created a grave mistake that most likely will take 12 -15months to realize they just bought into maybe the two most toxic markets which in my opinion are CLO and CMBS. What is the difference between debt and loan. Well these Loans never snapped not during 07,08,09,10.  CLO\u2019s took off because banks with their investment and hedge fund cohorts decided to Issue large loans to hedge funds who in return made high risk loans to all sorts of business\u2019s then brought that risk back to the bank to sell pool Moody\u2019s to grade and back out the market. What could go wrong? Well first off it doesn\u2019t take much to sell a million dollars. When your selling money your main goal is sell enough money in the subprime market your main goal is finding people that need a fresh start and do the best you can by them. Well for the most part the American business owner is his own worst enemy. Taking on leverage and risk without thinking about payback sounds like their banker friends take on leverage until they can longer pay. However small business doesn\u2019t have The Fed l blackrock. Most business debt never defaulted in 2007 because it was a stupidity problem of homeowners.This is all good and great until you start to understand what I am getting at which is that we have been in a correction decline since 2016.Then to say Great Recession are you kidding me what recession. 2009 until about fucking 45 days ago is the great America issue. 50% of Americans own small business\u2019s guess what else they own houses. Of that the subset for subprime it doesn\u2019t matter because dick&dodd and the failed Great Stimulus of 08-10. The question to yourselves is do you have a FICO of 480 -500 and do you own a business and a house. If the answer is yes then you start to see the problem. CMBS (Commercial)MBS now with business going under everyday these CLO\u2019s are being bought with no EPS their forever creating gaps in fair market value. The most toxic part of AMERICAS obsession with pushing risk tolerance and not being educated unless your like us then no one gives a fuck. Well now they have pulled an ML got suckered. When the Fed start realize they bought in some pools by now I am sure defunct business debt and more buildings. Positive you can\u2019t value a business without first knowing if it\u2019s gonna be able to re-open. 30% Default rate in CLO\u2019s 50%CMBS shit gets real very quick. We are in for 10 years of regrowth. Feds gun blows when underwriting catches up. Fallen Angels need to stay dead. \n\nSorry lazy no edit if you can\u2019t read it and or you don\u2019t get it.
