{"id": "f2bdwd", "title": "AMD LONG To Mars DD", "selftext": "Alright, fellow autists, new and ready to be screwed but here's some AMD DD for you schmucks. Inverse me cause I'm totally off my rocker and my day job has nothing to do with stonks or trading. You've been warned.  \n\n\nAMD having recently broken resistance at 50 is looking to scale even greater heights. Its lining up a very strong run-up for 2020, having ripped market share from Intel in Q4 2019 and Q1 2020.  \n\n\nBreaking down into points for all the illiterate:  \n\n\n**POINT 1: APPLE CURRENTLY TESTING AMD CHIPS IN MACBOOK PROs**  \nDevelopers have found snippets of code suggesting that Apple developers were testing AMD chips within the kits. [AMD new chips are almost exactly the multi-core solution](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/why-apple-should-ditch-intel-for-amd/) apple need and If this pans out they may replace Intel in the near future\n\nThis leads us nicely into the next point...\n\n**POINT 2: APPLE WANTS TO DITCH INTEL**  \nIntel has famously suffered from shortages leading to Apple blaming them in slumps in sale in [May 2019](https://www.techradar.com/sg/news/apple-blames-intels-processor-shortage-for-slump-in-mac-sales). They still can't get their shit together and [cant even confirm  if they can meet 2020 production.](https://marketrealist.com/2019/12/intels-cpu-shortage-impact-chip-giants-pc-makers/).  \nThey even wrote an [apology letter.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/intel-sorry-for-pc-chip-delays-but-we-just-cant-meet-demand-for-cpus/) Apple are looking to jump ship and AMD are starting to look like a luxury yacht. [Expect a JUNE 3rd Announcement at Apples Developers conference](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/apple-may-start-selling-macs-with-amd-cpus)\n\n**POINT 3: AMDs THREADRIPPERS ARE SETTING WORLD RECORDS**  \nOverclockers are using [threadrippers to clock in 5,548.71MHz.](https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-ryzen-threadripper-3990x-overclocked-at-55-ghz-is-setting-world-records) This is a day after release, with overclockers till continuing to tweak and optimize their rigs. Expect top tier sales from this bad boy from PC geeks worldwide\n\n**POINT 4: AMDs are in BOTH the PS5 and in the XBOX Series X**   \nBoth console giants are will be utilizing [AMD processors in their consoles](https://www.techradar.com/sg/news/could-amd-smartshift-be-the-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-secret-sauce-for-8k-gaming). What else do I have to explain? Its videogames everyone and their uncle is gonna have one.  \n\n\n**POINT 5: AMD WILL STILL BE RELEASING COMPETITIVE GPUS (BIG NAVI) AND CPUS (ZEN3)**\n\nRumors of a GPU releasing March 3 (supposedly an RTX2080 TI Killer) have been circulating, we may not see this date but [Su BAE herself has confirmed a 2020 release](https://www.tweaktown.com/news/70025/amd-ceo-dr-lisa-su-confirms-see-big-navi-2020/index.html).  \n[ZEN 3 Architecture was also confirmed by Queen Su](https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-zen-3) and will upgrade the company's mobile offering substantially.\n\nEND OF POINTS  \n\n\nBased on all the above, I believe AMD will see tremendous progress as a company and in its stock price. If it can survive any negative corrections, we may never see these prices again. If you want to YOLO on *actual* company doing disruptive things in its industry this is it.  \n\n\nDISCLAIMER: I don't currently own any positions in AMD all my money is with SATYA for 20/3. I am planning to roll tendies into AMD once I have closed  \nI am looking at \n\n20/6 80c\n\n18/7 80c\n\nLEAPS @ 80c-90c\n\nDISCLAIMER 2: I am not your financial consultant, broker or investment advisor I am a random stranger on the internet and am not liable for any of your bad decisions. Gamble at your own risk \n\nThank you for coming to my TED talk now go out there and get some tendies boys", "created_utc": 1581441101, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f2bdwd/amd_long_to_mars_dd/", "is_self": true}
