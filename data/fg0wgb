{"id": "fg0wgb", "title": "Ali Baba Thoughts?", "selftext": "Some technicals:  Ali Baba made a new technical low today on point and figure.  On the daily chart it has support on the 200 MA at 185.  It already broke support at the 50 MA at $215  on 2/18.  I would target an exit point at or around the 185 level.\n\nFundamentals:  Ali Baba has had a growing presence competing with ebay on their web site aliexpress.  However their brand image of cheap 3rd party goods Made in China has been destroyed.  They stopped or are delaying shipping of non-essential items from China.  Not to mention there is now a lot of distrust among other countries' buyers. \n\nHowever, the unknown factor in the room is the Chinese government's ability to intervene in the markets at will.  \n\nWondering if buying 3 month puts out is worth it on a greater index bounce.  It is not worth buying any puts at this point b/c of the high cost from IV.  The VIX is at a ridiculously high level.", "created_utc": 1583784490, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fg0wgb/ali_baba_thoughts/", "is_self": true}
