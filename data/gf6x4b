They can literally light shit on fire during any earnings call and its green by morning. Did you see lyft? Fucking dumpster fire. \n\nTTD IS FUCKING EXPENSIVE. Buy a spread, they are actually REALLY FUCKING CHEAP. \n\nPLAY SYMPATHY PLAYS. CRWD, NOW, CRM, etc. All those are going to get a boost from NET or TTD going through the roof.\n\nSwitch sounds good, haven't looked at them too much.\n\nNET is still kinda cheap and I could see them die mid day a bit before rocketing at EOD. I already got a call on them as insurance, but likely will go in further later today.\n\nDropbox? Everyone is bearish as shit on them. google trends says they suck dicks, but who cares, bad news is good news and the good news says fuck you dropbox up 20% ah. \n\nIm 3 for 3 on 3 different plays I said to do, lets keep it going. I don't think i can ask for money or tips but please post some gain porn and donate to a good cause, we are all really fucked in middle and lower classes. god save us all.\n\nEdit: And NET and DBX are off to the fucking races.", "created_utc": 1588859499.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gf6x4b/you_ready_for_today_earnings_dd_dropbox_ttd/", "is_self": true}
