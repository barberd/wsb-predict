{"id": "bzdlko", "title": "TLRY &amp; Privateer merger discussion and questions", "selftext": "So Brendan Kennedy after much negotiation has successfully made a deal with himself and agreed to acquire himself in an attempt to pump the stock price. But, The details of this merger have gone a little above my head and I would appreciate discussion from somebody who understands these dealings and implications better than I do. This is my understanding:\n\nPrivateer and TLRY will merge, TLRY will then sell half of privateers shares over the first year to institutional investors in block trades. Subsequently over the next year, Tilray will \u201cslowly\u201d sell off the remainder of the shares on the open market. \n\nI have a couple questions about this: \n\n1) will TLRY be paying privateer to merge with them? Or will it just be a transfer of shares from privateer to TLRY? Is there any transaction at all in this drawing, or is it simply a change on paper?\n\n2) when they sell half the shares to institutional investors as block trades how is this done? I assume they will sell these shares at a discount, but will these trades be recorded in the stock price? Will there be a lockup period for the institutional investors after they purchase these blocks?\n\n3) Am I gay even if I only sucked 3 dicks in college?", "created_utc": 1560265407, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bzdlko/tlry_privateer_merger_discussion_and_questions/", "is_self": true}
