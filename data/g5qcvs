My dumb ass bought into it, buying about $5,000 SNAP puts for 5/8. I\u2019m depressed, and know I\u2019ll be crushed at open. However, I feel like SNAP is going to be sold off heavily in the morning. Perhaps that over the next couple weeks, I could get lucky and recoup some losses, but it will take a shit ton of luck. \n\nTo those who ate SNAP\u2019s ass today as well, what will you do with your puts?", "created_utc": 1587512207.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5qcvs/to_those_like_me_who_got_fucked_by_snap_puts/", "is_self": true}
