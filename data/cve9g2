Do not give a fuck about stonks. Are you using the desktop  trading application, browser or mobile? Fidelity's desktop trading application is really good IMO. I read good reviews about thinkorswim and tried it out. I hate it and have been forcing myself to use it to see if it gets better but no luck. I want to try E-Trade soon. \n\n1. Fidelity\n2.
