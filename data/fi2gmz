After losing 20ishk this week, and closing my TSLA puts too early when it would've been 1000% gain. I snapped about and bought some TSLA calls because I hate myself. Let us see if Trump speaking in a bit can save me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[When I saved this image to my computer I even saved it as: Dumb](https://preview.redd.it/e4jr5dxiwgm41.png?width=1461&format=png&auto=webp&s=eebdc4a2cff230f66fabb92148480828dfc9dd4f)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: I could've sold about 20 min after buying these for about 160%. I'm not up about 8%. fml.\n\nUPDATE: Ended up selling cause I'm a big pu$$y. Made about 80%. Looking for something to put it all on for next week.
