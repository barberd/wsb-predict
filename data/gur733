It's not even a fluctuation on the graph or history.  I don't give a shit if the price is lower but it's enormously frustrating to see the market price figures be wrong at all, even more so when I try to trade based on what RH is showing.  I know I know get a real broker but god damn, this shit is infuriating.", "created_utc": 1591039822.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gur733/anyone_else_have_issues_selling_options_on_rh/", "is_self": true}
