Membership is $10/month. Why would anyone cancel their membership because of the corona virus? I\u2019m sure half the members don\u2019t use the membership even when there isn\u2019t a crisis. \n\nAt $10/month, I may join just in case I need quick access to an emergency shitter when I\u2019m in an unfamiliar place.

It\u2019s my top pick.
