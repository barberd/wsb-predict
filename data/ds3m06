{"id": "ds3m06", "title": "ITM Covered Call Question", "selftext": "Example:\n\nStock ticker: OMI\n\nStrategy:\n\nLong: 1000 shares\n\nWrite 5 covered calls taking 1/2 of my long position (ITM, strike of 5, currently trading at $6.5, expiry Nov 15)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am struggling to identify the payoff for this strategy should the stock decline in value. I understand that if the stock goes up, half of my shares are likely to be called away. However, trying to capitalize on an incredibly high IV, should they miss earnings tomorrow morning and the stock drops, would my covered call position increase in value allowing me to exit the position as a gain to hedge some of the losses from owning the underlying shares?\n\nIf someone can walk me through the payoff structure of an ITM written call option after an earnings miss, I would appreciate it.
