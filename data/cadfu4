So I\u2019m gonna toss this one up.  Someone let me know if I\u2019m autist. \n\nI\u2019ve been out of stocks for a while cause I YOLOd  into crypto/ICO.  Stocks/options were kicking my ass and I couldn\u2019t dedicate enough time to make good calls.  Bout a year and a half ago I dumped basically everything into an ico on ethereum.  It was EOS and it\u2019s currently in a triple bag state.  I\u2019m not planning to sell around 10x territory. \n\nEOS is inflationary (tokens created to pay for block production) so owning the token is literally like owning a long call option - except there is no expiration.  So inflation causes constant value decay like an option.  The idea is to bet on user growth outpacing inflation. \n\nSo I\u2019m just over here sitting on a pile of options that never expire.
