Additionally, calls expiring next month on $HYD have 100% IV for some reason (actually, probably because of the insane discount).\n\nThe Fed just announced today that they're going to start buying Muni bonds, so the liquidity issues in this market that are causing the discounts on these ETFs ($VTEB and $MUB are also trading at a discount, albeit a smaller one, as those own only investment grade muni bonds which are more liquid) are likely going to end soon, as the Fed starts buying: https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/20/federal-reserve-muni-bond-market-coronavirus/\n\nIf you buy blocks of 100 shares of $HYD (currently trading at around $47.20) and sell ITM calls against them (I went with 4/17 $47c for $5.20), and then hold them until expiry, you'll likely be assigned, and get to keep the $500 in option premium. Your risk here is if $HYD continues to drop which is very unlikely given the current magnitude of the discount, and the recent Fed announcement. You'll also get a tax-free dividend while you're holding the shares since $HYD pays out monthly and muni bonds are tax-free.", "created_utc": 1584722001.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flxzx4/12_lowrisk_profit_on_hyd_for_selling_itm_covered/", "is_self": true}
