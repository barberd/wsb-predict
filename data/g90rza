{"id": "g90rza", "title": "Draftkings VS Fanduel", "selftext": "TLDR: Fanduel is bigger than draftkings. Fanduel is  a part of a larger profitable company. DKNG is overvalued and Fanduel is undervalued. DKNG will probably be a meme stock anyways, markets are fake.\n\nBeloved DFS (daily fantasy sport) and three state Sportbook operator Draftkings went public on Friday to much screeching in this sub. Their combined market cap is \\~5 billion dollars. If you remember the 2015 nfl season you remember there is another DFS provider, Fanduel. In 2018, Fanduel got bought in a shady backroom deal by Flutter Entertainmenr (PDYPY) leaving the founder of the company with zero dollars. PDYPY is an established global gambling company with the leading market share in the UK, Ireland, Australia, and has hundreds of retail stores across the UK. This conglomerate, which is profitable, has a market cap of 8 billion dollars. Not only are they an established company, their Fanduel brand is beating Draftkings in the both the DFS and legal sports book market. So a company that is the leading brand in three countries where gambling is totally legal, and is beating DKNG in the us is only worth 3 billion more??\n\nNow the catch is DKNG has potential to be a serious meme stock. 30 million Americans unemployed, 2400 extra trump bucks a month. DKNG is going to be like SPCE, they have no revenue since market has been shut down. As we saw with SPCE no revenue is the most bullish indicator a company fan flash. We can see from this chart below that meme stocks initially drop, before a mass of uneducated investors hear about them. Anticipate DKNG to trend lower this week, before launching to the moon in May.\n\nSPCE Chart\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/orhp864a5dv41.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=abbc3cd77febdf796edf14eab0940b2f1997129a\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBesides meme stock potential one of the following has to be true,\n\n1. PDYPY market cap is too low\n2. DKNG market cap is too high.Play to both of these, literally can\u2019t go tits up.
