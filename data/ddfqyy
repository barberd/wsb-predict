{"id": "ddfqyy", "title": "Selling FDs", "selftext": "Ok I have a stupid newb question. I\u2019ve just been buying calls/puts and trading them like most of the retards on here. Say I wanted to sell these instead what\u2019s the risk? \n\nTake SPY as an example, it\u2019s currently at $294. I can sell a 10/09 $276p at a $0.04 strike right now giving me $4. There\u2019s no way in hell SPY drops to $276 by Wednesday. It could go to like $280, in which case the put will be worth more and the retard that bought it could trade it to make money. But this doesn\u2019t matter to me, as long it it keeps above $276, the put will expire worthless and I get to keep my $4. If by some miracle, Mango shits himself on TV or something, and SPY drops say $275 what happens? Whoever holds the put at the time will excersice it and I have to buy 100 shares of SPY at $276. What if I don\u2019t have $27,600 in my account? Is RH just gonna buy it and immediately sell at $275 and slap the $100 loss on me? Just trying to understand what actually happens in this situation.
