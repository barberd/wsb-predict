{"id": "gczbyf", "title": "Big Tech Waving the Rainbow Flag", "selftext": "It should be well known that FAANGM is dominating the S&P index weight at over 21%.  The combination of this dominance and the insulated nature of their business models have led to a lot of frustration for anyone running TA on the SPX during the recent rally.  With the risk of earnings behind us on big tech, lets take a look at how these bad boys are looking and what the implications are for the broader market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[AMZN Daily](https://preview.redd.it/l59fkfoj7mw41.png?width=1418&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fefb7961f5afa7b1a314e8c8e4427b7b232fc49)\n\nThere was a ton of speculation on AMZN going into earnings, but it is time for this baby to check back to the 2,000 - 2,200 range.  This would be a healthy pull back after the breakout to new highs, but would put a dent in the SPX performance.  MACD crossed over on Friday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[MSFT Daily](https://preview.redd.it/dfztu9s99mw41.png?width=1418&format=png&auto=webp&s=65341521aa5cf30f6b296b5b8a6c14b95da2fc0e)\n\nMSFT broke its uptrend a couple weeks ago, but hung on as it has an insulated business model and (IMO) if you are an index fund you couldn't afford to miss a breakout on earnings due to the contribution.  With earnings out and MACD waning after the double top at 180, I'm betting on a move back down to the 50 day MA.  Again, a pretty standard check back, but the 7% move down will weigh on the index thanks to the 5.7% weight in the SPY.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[AAPL Daily](https://preview.redd.it/1eqk7rqyamw41.png?width=1418&format=png&auto=webp&s=eaa9be1af319c90f4db71eb299f92340746721ad)\n\nAAPL, similar to MSFT, broke the uptrend a couple weeks ago, but was bid up into earnings.  With that behind us there is room for a healthy correction back to the 50 day MA at \\~270.  That is a 6.5% move down with an over 5% weight in the SPY.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[SPX Daily](https://preview.redd.it/q759igkjdmw41.png?width=1418&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e70f5bef509a47100dd297c730bebbb35f7568b)\n\nTo tie things together, the rolling over of big tech could drive the S&P down to the 50 day MA of \\~2,740.  If momentum to the downside picks up, we could see \\~2,640.  \n\n**TL/DR:**  Market sentiment has been influenced by big tech, so look for big tech to signal the next leg down.  With earnings out, technicals are turning negative, which removes the positive influence on broader market.  Tech is likely to outperform throughout this recession, but this increases the probability for downside moves on the names that are truly getting bent over.    \n\n**Positions:** SPXS, SPYp 5/15 +270/-260,  XLFp 6/19 +20/-18, ZMp 8/21 +130/-100, XLEp 6/19 35", "created_utc": 1588543856.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gczbyf/big_tech_waving_the_rainbow_flag/", "is_self": true}
