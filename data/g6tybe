Can I put it under shitpost or options, It just got taken down with no notice, I am not cussing or being racist I am being hyperbolic I agree but the underlying play is still a good idea!\n\nI have a legendary play to share with you all. I never post but I have discovered an amazing play, I owe this DD to you guys, for helping me at times. I am returning the favor to you all for your great memes and \\*advice\\*.\n\nOil Oil Oil. Yes it's already known here that Tankers are about to rocket to the moon and then Mars. Storage across the country is completely full and rates are soaring to beyond price gouging like rates!\n\nA Lot of us are investing In oil tanker companies, correct? Well what about land based storage companies? Duh, that obvious right! So obvious I didn\u2019t consider it thinking it was so obvious everybody would have pumped them already. Boy was I wrong.\n\nA Headline caught my eye yesterday. DKL up 50 percent in a day! DKL is a land based oil storage, and transportation company. Wow I thought, that is crazy they are still below their all time highs too. So then I started doing more research and put together a list of pipeline, midstream, and logistics companies. And nearly all of them are forming cup and handle formations. BUT THE BEST PART IS THE OPTIONS PREMIUMS ARE STILL DIRT CHEAP!\n\nPoint is, just like tankers these land based storage companies should be at their all time highs. They are already raising dividends! But yet they are still down 30-40 percent from yearly highs. I am going YOLO, I never do that but this trade is simply to good. Almost all these companies report during the first week of may or second may, mark my words they will pump. THE CALLS ARE INSANELY CHEAP. Get in now. I'm talking 10,0000 PERCENT GAINS.\n\nHere is a list of Oil logistics companies that I compiled and researched after hours of work.\n\nBUY CALLS\n\nMPLX\n\nPAA\n\nPBFX\n\nDKL (THIS ONE SPIKED RECENTLY SO PREMIUMS ARE WAY HIGHER)\n\nSHLX\n\nCNXM\n\nMMP\n\nPAGP\n\nI want to be in WSB Elite, this trade will show my worth, I'M GOING YOLO ON IT, so if it works I will be a Millionaire easy!
