Do you really think these whales are in it to lose 99% of their million dollar positions? They know the direction of the underlying in advance or have some sort of insider info and know their DD is going to churn up some big profits for next year's model lambos and threesome orgies in a penthouse with supermodel hookers.\n\n\"Large option sweep flow are just institutions hedging their positions\" you say? Well fuck then just ignore the puts purchased or calls written (bearish trades). Go for the insanely large bullish trades.\n\nYou still need to verify total no. of contacts in OI though.\n\n\"Maybe it's just one leg of a complex multileg strategy\" you say? Well shit....you should have on your radar repeated, large options sweeps where the whales keep buying calls over and over again throughout the day.\n\nMay all your YOLO's be fruitful motherfuckers.", "created_utc": 1567138635, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cxbxe8/increasing_the_chances_of_your_yolo_bets/", "is_self": true}
