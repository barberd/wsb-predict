I have TLRY puts that I'm trying to cash in on and Robinhood keeps cancelling them midday. I'm in no panic, they expire next year, but I'd love to cash out for other plays. What's the deal? They're all 20 and 30 strikes that I bought in March. Am I stupid? I post them to sell then an hour or so later it will tell notify me that the sale was cancelled. I'm not having issues with other tickers though, and I have no clue why these aren't nearly instant sales to begin with.
