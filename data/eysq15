Tesla hits ATH the next day and investors double their shorts.   Tesla hits ATH three days in a row and the bears poop their shorts.  \nQuality bears are waiting now for blood in the water before they buy puts.  This is because everyone including your mom is waiting for the next correction so they can buy in.  FOMO will abate any significant correction this week or next.  Word to your mother!\nI predict a correction will come... and go in time.   It will be interesting to see the shape of the downturn.   Bears have FOMO too.  If a real correction gains momentum it could become a bloodbath but I believe bull FOMO will hold us through a couple days.   In other words.  I think we need two trading days of weak or zero gains to induce a sell off.", "created_utc": 1580834216, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eysq15/killatesla_and_the_laws_of_fomo/", "is_self": true}
