The truckloads of viagra (\"stimulus\") JPow pumped into the market will be enough to get us through the next month or two, at which point, back to Jan 2020 levels of economic activity, right?\n\nNo bro.  The thing is, UNTIL there is a vaccine that everyone has access to (2021 event), the more the economy opens up, the more the virus will recirculate.  A V shaped recovery is NOT POSSIBLE because relaxing social distancing will cause another spike infections.  How do you think the market will recover once it figures this out?  We are in for months of start and stop false hope until the market finally understands that economic activity is NOT COMING BACK to pre-virus levels.  Can you imagine the harm to sentiment this summer when they open up bars, everyone rushes to them b/c we are all tired of being caged at home, only to have them close again?  This is what will happen.\n\nWe are past the crash phase.  We are not past the bear market downtrend.  We are going lower but it will take time.  Please - and I can't emphasize this enough for you retards - DON'T buy short dates puts.  Go out and sit on them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGL Idiots", "created_utc": 1586605645.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fz3fpo/why_v_shaped_recovery_is_impossiblw/", "is_self": true}
