I need to calm my ass down, but here's how it went down:\n\nFrom my last post, I had bought $UBER calls, bu I felt like absolute trash the next day and sold for [$820 profit](https://imgur.com/a/MNQFCWZ). The next day I bought $BA calls because I'm an idiot and doubled down because I'm a double idiot, but at least I sold as the market was crashing for a [$1260 loss](https://imgur.com/a/Mdu60oH). Almost immediately after that, I decided I should have listened to the gold gang and bought $GLD calls near the high of that day, but it's ok because I doubled down at almost exactly the bottom of the day and it shot up today for a [$8610 gain](https://imgur.com/a/N8H16fc)\n\nI'm so close to being [free from the PDT rule](https://imgur.com/a/bRy6kj5) for the first time in my life and I bet I'll never want to give it back, but when you're on a hot streak, you gotta keep going!", "created_utc": 1582334380, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7l9ay/10_steps_to_1_million_steps_2_and_3_complete/", "is_self": true}
