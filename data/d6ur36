Germany released a PPI report that was weaker than expected, validating the concerns about weak inflation that spurred the ECB recently to be more accommodative with its monetary policy. Separately, Brexit matters remain a focal point after EC President Juncker stirred things up yesterday in a *Sky News* interview, saying he thinks there can be a deal. He also added, however, that the EU is prepared for no deal, too.
