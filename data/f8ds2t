This is an attempt to strengthen my confidence in getting calls on $ENPH. It's pretty similar to AMD in my opinion, how it has risen so fast, and can fall the same. But I don't see any bad news on the horizon. If last week was any indicator, as the rest of the market took massive hits. $ENPH seemed to dip just momentarily, then rise again. But, I can see analysts on Monday saying *and now we are seeing delayed effects of last week's market dip on $ENPH*...
