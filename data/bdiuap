Baby's first DD on WSB", "selftext": "The case for EA\n\n\nManagement\n\nForward looking, conservative management. \u00a0I know that it is all the rage to hate EA. However, they seem to have learned some hard lessons over the last year. They have driven monetization in video games and they flew too close to the sun. \u00a0I think that they have learned their lessons as evidenced by the new Star Wars game having no MTX and the releasing a f2p battle royale with no pay to win. However, they still drive monetization in their sports games and while there is community unrest all revs are growing with FIFA having its best quarter ever. EA beats earnings most of the time because they use conservative estimates. \u00a0This is great when they surprise launch a game that happens to be very successful. (Apex Legends 88 metacritic) In addition to conservative forecasts they delayed release of Battlefield V(81 metacritic) and launched into a much more competitive window in order to release a better game. They made a wise choice that hurt sales but protected the brand. This shows that management is looking forward past a quarter. \u00a0It also helped make a bad quarter which is setting up our current entry. They are also in the middle of 2.4b buyback.\n\nApex\n\n\nApex Legends. Quick Numbers: 50mm players/ 92mm rev first 30. \u00a0This is insane for \u201cnew\u201d ip. Apex is always a top 10 twitch streamed game. \u00a0It will not dethrone fortnite but we don\u2019t need it to. The first 30 days did not have much to buy on the store and there was no battlepass, so 92mm was pretty impressive. \u00a0If they can continue it will contribute 1.1b in high margin revenues. \n\nRemember how we talked about conservative management from EA? \u00a0They did not price in this game. Here are two different quotes from their Feb 5th conference call one day after the games release: \u201cwe put very little revenue into this quarter for it because we just didn't know. But by the time we give guidance in May, we'll have a much better sense of what we think that will be based on the number of users coming in and then those users that are spending across the live services that we'll continue to roll out.\u201d \u201cIt's just so early. We don't want to put too much into the model yet. And it's really not built -- when I gave that guidance earlier on, low single digit -- or mid to low single digits for the total business, that doesn't really anticipate a huge number for our lives service business yet.\u201d \n\nThe battlepass was released to a community hungry to buy it on 3/19 @ 9.99. \u00a0We heard the game made 92mm in the first 30 which would bring us to ~3/7 which leaves 24 days left in the quarter for store rev and 12 days of battlepass sales. If they continue on their original 92mm pace that is 70mm+battlepass sales. \u00a0I think that regular store numbers will go down but again, very little of this rev is priced in.\n\nMargins of Apex. \u00a0Being digital only and being released on origin for pc means that margins are higher than traditional games. \u00a0While EA did not elaborate on the margin spread it is estimated to be around 70% console and 95% pc vs 50% for physical. A 30% margin boost off the top makes revenue numbers that much more impressive.\n\nApex Expansion: \u201cwe are looking at how to take the game to mobile and cross-play over time.\u201d I think that crossplay will increase the player base and hopefully they can get it done. Im unsure on what Apex looks like in mobile form but it has my interest.\n\n\nAnthem\n\nWhat a disappointment with a silver lining. \u00a0Management was conservative on mtx forecasts but not on disc sales. \u00a0They estimated 5-6mm unit sales in their call but in articles Im seeing they predict 37 million by 3/31. \u00a0I dont know if I\u2019m misunderstanding something here but either way Anthem was the best selling game in February and it was only out for 6 days. I think march sales data will show a sharp decline (due soon). It got horrible reviews but it seems they might have still moved a decent amount of units. \u00a0It will be interesting to see if they can fix its problems before players completely give up on it. Overall im bearish on Anthem. It is reassuring that they didn\u2019t forecast high \u201clive\u201d sales\n\nBFV\n\nBFV is now the largest BF game ever according to their recent cc. \u00a0They released Fire Storm which is their version of a battle royale on 3/24. BFV is like a train. It\u2019s not flashy but it has a huge player base that chugs along and makes a profitable ip. I think it will help quelch the potential anthem miss.\n\n\nNew Titanfall Premium game\n\nTitanfall and Titanfall 2 are two of the best shooters ever made. They had underwhelming sales both received critical success \u00a0(high 80\u2019s on metacritic). Apex legends take place in the same universe as Titanfall and uses a lot of the same story, assets, and gameplay. \u00a0Given the popularity of Apex a lot of players were introduced to the universe. They are planning on capitalizing with a \u201cpremium titanfall game\u201d in this fiscal. \u00a0While I think it\u2019s rather far off I think its going to be really big given that it will essentially look like a spin off from Apex Legends (even though its really the other way around) given Apex\u2019s commercial success.\n\n\nStar Wars Game\n\nThey release their new Star Wards game 11/15 and it is being made by respawn currently. \u00a0I think that they are the perfect studio for the game and I think its going to be huge. It comes out right before the move and right after the new Disney area comes out. \u00a0Star wars hype will be huge and they are taking a very conservative no micro transaction no multiplayer strategy. I think that this is exactly the model to take for this fanbase and will be able to be monetized further in the future. \u00a0I think that at $60 a pop they are going to make a killing on this game and set themselves up in the future. Community sentiment for this game and respawn is super high right now and I have bought into it.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nI am rockhard long for $EA and think that it is going to pop. \u00a0I think 130 is a conservative EOY PT. I would recommend stock and any calls that expire starting after next earnings (5/7). \u00a0I myself have loaded up on 5/17, 9/20, and 1/2020 calls and will continue to do so.\n\n\nTLDR Im so sure about this that you better be safe and just inverse me and buy as many puts as your margin will allow you.", "created_utc": 1555349580, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bdiuap/the_case_for_ea_babys_first_dd_on_wsb/", "is_self": true}
