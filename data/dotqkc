I felt like it was going back down, and I couldn\u2019t sell because of PDT, so I bought a put at the same strike price at the same expiration date to solidify profits. The stock price is went down like I thought it would, but my gains went down as well, despite the put. Should I have sold a call instead? How do you get around PDT?", "created_utc": 1572372823, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dotqkc/getting_around_pdt/", "is_self": true}
