This morning, Hedgeye listed this as their best short idea and they think it can fall 50% from here. \n\nAll it\u2019s doing is loading more shorts into the name. No shares to borrow at IB (20k swallowed up instantly)\nShort borrow rates\n2 days ago: 5-6%\nYesterday: 9-10.6%\nToday as of 10am: 16.8%\nAs of 11am: 20.75%\n\nThis rate increase is happening faster than I thought it would. I\u2019m not selling my calls. But if you are nervous- you should probably sell them. This is a high risk trade that will probably cause you to lose all your money and make you homeless. \n\nIf you listened to PTON present last night, the CEO said this was their peak cost year (2 newly built studios being unused at the moment). I highly recommend listening to the 25 min presentation and to draw your own conclusions.
