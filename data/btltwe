{"id": "btltwe", "title": "PDVW - not option but stock.", "selftext": "Guys checkout out PDVW as portfolio protection. They hold spectrum that can be repurposed to be use as Private LTE for utilities ( think smart grid and hackers). FCC gave them approval with 60 day comment period and 30 day to replay. So total of 90 days. That was on March 12. Thus far only one oppose which is Florida power and light (leave it to FL to mess things up). But I hear that is being resolved. \n\nBack story. PDVW holds 900 MHz band 8 spectrum. It is the same spectrum that was used by Nextel. After sprint purchased Nextel they didn\u2019t know how to commercialize or use spectrum so they sold it back to the Nextel founders. Now that old Nextel company is called PDVW (to make it just simple)\n\nPDVW provides 900 band 8 LTE spectrum nationwide. Thus far department of Energy, FCC and almost all large investor owned utilities and railroads have sent letter to the fcc about the need for private LTE needs. \n\nLast week they had investor week. Their stock is on the rise. I have been on PDVW for about 6 month. \n\nAlso they are somewhat trade protected. \n\nNote: they don\u2019t have option to trade; first stock I have every come across that does not have options. Anyone know why", "created_utc": 1558962559, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/btltwe/pdvw_not_option_but_stock/", "is_self": true}
