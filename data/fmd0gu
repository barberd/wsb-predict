{"id": "fmd0gu", "title": "The tales of an extraordinary WSB autist", "selftext": "So, we've all heard about the non-fiction WSB book. How about a fictional depiction (hear me out), of an autist(!). The story would follow the discovery of WSB and the subsequent inevitable  descent into madness. There would be piercing descriptions of his strained relationships as well as a beautiful panorama spanning great gains and horrendous losses. Can you you even begin to fathom what a success it would be? No, you're retarded, but, you may be able to grasp the impact it would have on boomers. It would rock the elitist boomer critics dwindling world one last time, exposing their fraudulent ideas of \"hard work\", \"investing\" and \"index funds\" for what they truly are; means of supressing the capitalist autists from their god given right to own a lambo. \n\nI for one could even see it being converted to film. It would top the NYTs best seller list. WSB would be the name on everyone's lips. However, as with all things great, it would be tarnished by it's own fame. The scandals would start cropping up and the profiteers trying to make a quick buck would pretend to be OG WSBers in order to scam desperate boomers who sold all their assets during the great depression 2: Corona boogaloo. Therefore, it would end in disgrace, with former WSBers being hunted for sport, even mere lurkers. \n\nAnd the title? That's my intellectual property, but I will graciously agree to hand it over to the highest bidder, starting at the trivial sum of $100 000.", "created_utc": 1584786471.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmd0gu/the_tales_of_an_extraordinary_wsb_autist/", "is_self": true}
