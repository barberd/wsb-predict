{"id": "ew0hz4", "title": "Early assignment on RH", "selftext": "So i received an email from RH probably an hour ago about restrictions on my account and i was wondering what just happened. An hour later i received another email from RH saying that I've been assigned short leg (144 put) of my DIS 139-144-149 short iron butterfly expiring Friday. I'm not sure what's the default policy here. Since I've a 139 Put as well, shouldn't they calculate the difference and put me at max loss? I didn't realize that i actually did have 14k+ balance because of margin so as of now my DIS shares are up by 100. What are my options here? Do i need to tell RH to exercise the 139 option tomorrow and sell everything off?", "created_utc": 1580362489, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ew0hz4/early_assignment_on_rh/", "is_self": true}
