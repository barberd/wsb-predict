{"id": "dif17t", "title": "KOK", "selftext": "Sup, fucksticks. Bet that title sucked you in, didn't, you saucy little hu-er?\n\nLet me here tell bout my beeeestfriend. NOK.\n\nNow, I promised a group of our finest a long-ass time ago that I'd post some goddamn DD on this company. So, here I am a few months late. Remember that guy that said to buy NOK in July cuz it would do gud (too lazy to search)? Well, it's time.\n\nNOK isn't your \ud83e\uddf1 phone builder no mo. They subbed that shit out. They have built a monster, behemoth of a 5g company. End-end service and infrastructure. The ONLY company that knows smartphone radio targeting, all the way up to large terminal installation. In fact, they built a test lab for all the little bitchboys to come frolic at. Want to know how fast 5g downlink gets trap porn to your eyeholes? 1 terabit a second.\n\nLet me repeat myself, NOK 5g tech will have you gaped and dripping faster than an internet backbone. Via phonebone. Imagine you imagining your 'girl'friend inside ya via Oculus. 1 terabit. City tested, nerd approved. 60-70gbps at peak 'load' usage.\n\nHow might you ask? MiMO Terminals. Why should you give a shit? They've already rolled them out for Sprint. Revenue, dumbfuck. Greenbacks. About 60 milly per. And it's just starting. That covers 11 cities, it's going to get bigger.\n\nI have built like-kind terminals. My business was controlling satellites. I understand the bandwidth and cost to infrastructure + maintenance contracts intimately. \n\nSo, the bad. Ten year downtrend. It is bucking that. It gave up gains due to a lovely index topping pattern and the fact that the market doesn't trust it. Lots of investors have a nightmare of a recovery sale wall up. \n\nThe good. 3 year restructuring is over. Last ER could have been a 'fluke'. This one will prove it is not. It's tough to buck ten years and high cost/capex. The cost cutting measures are done. Revenues for the 5g contracts begins this quarter. ERIC has 23 contracts, NOK 48, Huawei 52, and guess what wasn't given - Huawei ban removal. It's shit-or-get-off-the-pot-oclock for all carriers. Verizon has opted to send billions to Samsung to develop in tandem end-to-end. They then failed at their NFL stadium 'rollout'. They beat earnings last quarter. They are going to fucking smash them this quarter. They raised guidance last quarter. They have doubled their contracts since last ER calculations (included revenue inflows and margin increase). Their P/E is in the shitter due to terribad restructuring and capex costs. This benefits you jackass.\n\nWhat you're hoping for: If they utter any of the following phrases 'we now see net earnings per share of .5 for the full year 2020', 'we are pleased to raise guidance for revenue over the coming year by up to 5 billion', 'we are raising forward dividend yields by .05',  'we have been approached by Samsung for a buyout of our smartphone division', or 'we have opened our home internet routing division based on our 200 5g patents', be wearing depends and NOT logged into your /r/dudesindiapers alt, because the stream of shit is sending you straight to the moon. First two are likely during this call, third one guaranteed by next two ERs, fourth is just a personal hope of mine, last one is something someone should be mailing to the CEO. Their diapers alt, that is.\n\nWhy right now? ERIC ER Thursday. They are a stocks darling not on a downtrend, have half the contracts, and will boost sector. You can make a sector AND Vega slam dunk on NOK without playing for ER.\n\nIf you believe the market is going to shit itself before next week, zip your happy ass over to Dec18's chart of NOK. 4.77 low. A loss of .15 in stock value for a massive haircut. Get fucked and get iron hands.\n\nAnswering questions as necessary. \n\nTl;Dr - \nComcast 2p get fucked\nNOK 5c any expiry 11/1 or beyond\nNOK 6c DEC or beyond\nInverse me fuckers. [I have 588 contracts and raising that to 1k before ER](http://imgur.com/a/W6b6HkC)\n\nAsk /u/gatoken1 and /u/yeoldefirsttimer what my flair is supposed to fucking be", "created_utc": 1571175934, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dif17t/kok/", "is_self": true}
