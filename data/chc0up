{"id": "chc0up", "title": "McDonalds DD", "selftext": "I ate McDonalds everyday twice a day for nearly four years and I've been eating way less recently. One thing that caused the increase in their sales was excellent deals on their app encouraging larger orders for more food. The app basically allowed them to price discriminate their customers. Its improved it's interface/functionality recently, but the deals have been significantly worse. My guess is the analysts don't eat McDonalds and are unaware of this, I think they aren't going to meet their expectations this quarter and will take a hit. Maybe it's just a change in my age, but it just seems many people in my friend group eat way less.", "created_utc": 1563993123, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/chc0up/mcdonalds_dd/", "is_self": true}
