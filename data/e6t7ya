I am still doing this, do not fear.  But some of that money is going into PTON calls.  I was cooking dinner and NPfuckingR just ran a 9 minute piece on the commercial.  I was cursing at the dumb shit the woman they were interviewing about the commercial was saying.  She got rejected for a PTON commercial a few years back.. we can guess why but no matter one of the most unnerving things that was said was that why would this obviously fit woman need a Peleton.  More 'only fat people need to exercise bullshit' . What is wrong with this fucking country?  One of the reasons these thots aren't fat is because they hit the gym.  But no Fat is beautiful and we should accept the 280 pound land whale sitting next to us on our Delta flight to Vegas and probably give her a foot massage during the flight too.. FUCK THAT.  Just because your thin doesn't mean your fit and just because your fit doesn't mean you don't want to get more fit or want or need a new exercise to take you to the next fucking level.  What does all this mean?  **LONG PTON**.", "created_utc": 1575604536, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e6t7ya/pton_calls_for_all_tomorrow_npr_runs_a_story_on/", "is_self": true}
