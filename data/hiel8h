{"id": "hiel8h", "title": "Why I purchased Calls on AAL", "selftext": "Today I purchased $14 8/7 Calls on AAL for 1.48. Before everybody starts talking about how bad their books are and how they are the worst airline of all of them to choose from, I have my reasoning. \n\n1) The premium is cheap. While looking at other airlines, I found AAL to be cheaper. Less risk for possible reward.\n\n2) AAL and all other airlines tend to move together right now. Until AAL releases some bad news, the shares appear to be moving the same way that others do.\n\n3) The Robinhood affect - If airlines as a whole start moving up, there is a huge group of retail investors who look to purchase shares in the industry, at the cheapest price. Look at OAS for when OPEC was having their meeting. People like to play the momentum with the cheapest shares possible. \n\n4) Although AAL is not the best airline, nor is it in the best shape financially, AAL isn't going anywhere in my opinion. I don't believe we are going to see AAL back down to 9-10 dollars before we see it reach 15-18.\n\nOverall your plays are your plays, I am not trying to persuade anybody to buy calls, I am just trying sharing my thoughts and ideas. Trade at your own risk. Please let me know what you think.", "created_utc": 1593484705.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hiel8h/why_i_purchased_calls_on_aal/", "is_self": true}
