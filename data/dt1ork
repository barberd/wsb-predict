{"id": "dt1ork", "title": "WSB Weekly Herald: Fiverr, Freelance Indonesian Developers Subpoenaed Over Robinhood Software Glitch", "selftext": "As the fallout of Robinhood's most recent scandal heats up, officials have subpoenaed a group of freelance software developers based in Jakarta who worked on portions of Robinhood's back-end servers, as well as Fiverr, the platform on which Robinhood hired them.  \n\nCourt filings indicate that the entirety of Robinhood's funds management infrastructure was built over the course of 18 months by developers operating under the name Faraji Applications Great Solutions. This layer of Robinhood's stack is apparently the source of a glitch where proceeds from options sales are erroneously added to a user's buying power.  The glitch has been exploited by a number of foolhardy amateur traders who might actually be committing fraud, and has potentially cost Robinhood millions of dollars in irrecoverable losses.\n\nThe fintech startup reportedly paid the Indonesians $16,000 throughout the contract. \n\nFiverr representatives vehemently denied any wrongdoing in a statement Wednesday night.  Idanau Whadaym Douyng, self-titled CEO of Faraji, declined to comment for this story.", "created_utc": 1573150571, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dt1ork/wsb_weekly_herald_fiverr_freelance_indonesian/", "is_self": true}
