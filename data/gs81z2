Yolo OTM puts/calls and hope that it works or you can play the patience game by picking the right stock that will do well. I know most people on this sub have an attention span of a gold fish since everyone want quick tendies and they want it now. I opt for the latter because I preferred guaranteed tendies.\n\n /\n\nIf you're like me and you want guaranteed tendies then look into EZPW, SELF and PSA. These are recession stocks that usually do well during tough economic times. EZPW is a payday advance stock which usually do very well during economic hardship. Banks are tightening lending rules, so it's going to be near impossible for people to get loans. I don't know if you autists look at a company's gross profit vs cost of expenses before investing (looking at TSLA investors), but this company has been making a constant profit even before COVID and/or the recession. They should do very well for the next year or more.\n\n/\n\nSELF is self explanatory. They focus on self-storage facilities in the Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Oklahoma area. We all know that people are going to get evicted given that the number of loans in forbearance increased to 8.16 percent as of May 10, up from 7.91 percent the week prior. That means about over 4M people will soon be evicted with many more to come as more companies are laying off workers. Unfortunately, options is not available for this stock yet, but if options is your preferred choice then look at PSA (Public Storage).\n\n/\n\nEZPW $7.50 01/15/21 call leap or just buy shares.\n\nPSA $220 1/15/21 call leap or just buy shares.\n\nSELF shares only", "created_utc": 1590678792.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gs81z2/recession_plays_for_2020/", "is_self": true}
