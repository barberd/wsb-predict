{"id": "d4tj7u", "title": "Tesla gigafactory 3", "selftext": "A single neuron fired off a few minutes ago and I decided to post this. \n\nTesla is nearing completion of this factory. They will build and assemble the entire car (model 3 and model y) within the factory. It's not clear if they will manufacture their own batteries or source them from a supplier. But it seems that unlike the fremont + gigafactory1 combo in America there will be a single factory in Shanghai. Now, they have learned many a lesson trying to manufacture cars in America, and all of these lessons will get applied to this new factory. So ostensibly they will be able to manufacture cars much more efficiently in this new factory. Not only will the build be more efficient, but they will also get a much cheaper supply of materials (china supply chain) and cheaper labor as well. So higher efficiency + lower operational costs will result from the factory. Now, they also plan on selling the cars for the same price as they sell for in America, and actually their world-wide plan is to have the same price everywhere (we'll see how that goes). So the model 3, and especially the model y (which features much more efficient wiring harness and possibly rigid wires which make automation easier) should be BIG, BIG time profitable in China. And honestly, EVs have such a huge potential for profitability in general because they are mechanically very, very simple, but that's a discussion for a different time. \n\nSo, it's very, very clear the profit potential there is massive. However, one issue is Tesla will make these profits in Yuan. I have this sense that the Chinese government might not like it if Tesla converts all these profits back to dollars and sends it back to America. A quick google search reveals that citizens have a yearly limit of converting $50k yuan to dollars. And I'm sure if you come near this limit questions will be asked. \n\nWhat do you think Tesla's game plan is here?", "created_utc": 1568595947, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d4tj7u/tesla_gigafactory_3/", "is_self": true}
