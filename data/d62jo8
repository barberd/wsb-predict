{"id": "d62jo8", "title": "$FSLY Squeeze?", "selftext": "Right now, FSLY has a public float of around 11M shares. Now like you autists, I have no idea how cloud based service providers make money, but Fastly has some heavy hitters as customers. Twitter for one, is bringing in the Ad tendies like there\u2019s no tomorrow. But this brings me to the problem at hand. Of the 11M public float, around 5.5M are being shorted. Over 50% of the outstanding are being shorted while Fastly just broke past $30 a share earlier this month. Anyways, I\u2019m thinking one of these days pretty soon, people gonna wanna buy $FSLY. And those outstanding shares will he bought up, and the stock price will increase.....Fastly.", "created_utc": 1568833715, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d62jo8/fsly_squeeze/", "is_self": true}
