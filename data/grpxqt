(link to said post below), but now is the time to drop the real DD.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gr0g4y/zumz\\_high\\_risk\\_high\\_reward/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gr0g4y/zumz_high_risk_high_reward/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\n\nZumiez is THE leading action/sports/fashion retailer for demographics of 13-30. They sell the hottest shit for the masses in that demo like hot cakes. They\u2019ve been hitting it hard with sequential growth for 12+ years. See for yourself. [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ZUMZ/earnings/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ZUMZ/earnings/)\n\n**700+ stores**; 607 in the United States, 50 in Canada, 34 in Europe and 7 in Australia. Majority of which were closed due to the pandemic.\n\n\u201cMALLS CLOSED = STONKS TANK!\u201d. Please. Think 1 level deeper.\n\nThey have an online store that ships internationally. Where do 13-30 year olds shop these days during the pandemic? Online.\n\nWho are the ones going out and about during the pandemic still wanting to rock fresh threads? 13-30 year olds.\n\nAre their stores really \u201cclosed though? To walk-in customers yes, but operationally no. The biggest contributor to Zumiez online success is their adoption of Amazon style shipping hubs. All their stores are enabled to fulfill and ship online orders, and at every major city they are located in they have a large store that acts as a small distribution center with heavy inventory. This allows delivery times to be cut dramatically.\n\nHigh level financials:\n\nQ1 & Q2 historically posts lower EPS due to sales dipping and then ramp up in Q3-Q4 for Summer and holidays. If you take a look at the EPS estimate its -0.41 per share (negative) for Q2. The analysts are expecting a blood bath due to all the stores being closed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/de0530gruc151.png?width=490&format=png&auto=webp&s=1815f65a99c91a401ce8a21717f8b340894cd983\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTechnical Analysis (I\u2019ll keep it simple):\n\nAfter the COVID crash, the stock has been bouncing off $22.80\\~ resistance unable to break through. As of yesterday it broke through. Next resistance is $25, then finally $26, then it\u2019s open to pre COVID levels from there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9wobkgrsuc151.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=6321b9a7b69099f14a772282ade17d5fe5c3584e\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cBUT VOLUME IS SO LOW\u201d \u2013 Valid point, but take a look at the daily volume spikes around quarterly earnings. More liquidity will build.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tryoppxtuc151.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6dcebe5e7fd6d554a593ae61a4beb01b850719d\n\nSo to conclude, here\u2019s my bet. Zumiez is going to beat forecasts in both EPS and revenue and upgrade their guidance for Q3&Q4 after seeing online sales CRUSH it in Q2.\n\n6/19 25c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cvuhqe2vuc151.png?width=356&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cc2194964398b5c446026c9882d30d2f9d5494d", "created_utc": 1590606046.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/grpxqt/zumz_619_25c_the_follow_up_dd/", "is_self": true}
