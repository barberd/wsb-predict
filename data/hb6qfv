{"id": "hb6qfv", "title": "PRPL is the next meme stock", "selftext": "PRPL has had a couple great days coming off the Oppenheimer Conference where people with money who do math started buying this when they realized that it is underpriced.\n\n[I called the $19+ price point a few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gqpqa3/prpl_to_19_by_812_er_calling_it_again/), but it looks like it has come much sooner than expected.   The stock will continue to grow into the $20-$24 where it belongs due to the math money piling in.\n\nCouple this with the meme chasers coming to the realization that HTZ is about as worthless as tits on a nun and DKNG disappointing the last few weeks more than your wedding night.   Where is all the meme money going to turn?  PRPL.\n\nWhy?  It has already minted a few millionaires and ***the stock is still going to go up***.  I'm personally a day or so away from becoming a multi-millionaire.  [Great works of art](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/haojra/udhsmatt2_the_wolf_of_prpl_mattresses/) have commemorated /u/dhsmatt2 [flexing his big guns](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hajqh3/prpl_another_300k_in_the_bank_from_mattresses_ceo/) and dunking on me.  \n\nThis sucker has meme potential all over it.  It's got the same ingredients when fake wsbgod pushed TSLA, SPCE and whatever else, except this time there are real gains on display.\n\n# I'm calling this right now.   Again.\n\nPRPL is gonna meme right past the $20-$24 where it should be according to \"fundamentals\" and boom up into the mid-thirties range before it gets frothy and retracts down a bit.\n\nI guess hold on, hop in, or watch from the sidelines.   This is gonna be fun to watch!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n/u/superpositivity:   you [better have held](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gzyswg/prpl_nurple_are_my_tits_about_to_go_up/) man.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr  PRPL is gonna meme up.   Want actual DD?   Read my post history or /u/dhsmatt2's post history.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm long PRPLW.   I was originally planning to phase out my investment in PRPLW with a full exit by $24 on the stock price, but I may hold a little longer for the upcoming ride.   I'll still hold a heavy position in PRPL and PRPL calls after that.", "created_utc": 1592450849.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hb6qfv/prpl_is_the_next_meme_stock/", "is_self": true}
