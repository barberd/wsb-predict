{"id": "fha1d0", "title": "DD: Micron Puts", "selftext": "My friend just went on a cruise with destinations in Mexico. His flight back home had an 8 hour layover in Seattle, before finally landing in Boise. He is has now had a fever for 3 days with other corona virus symptoms. He has not visited any medical professionals or been tested for COVID-19. This means there has been 3 days of opportunity for him to spread beer flu in Boise, including to Micron employees. It is not unlikely that he came into contact with at least one Micron employee, considering they are a major employer in Boise. \n\nHere is the real DD: This dude works for a company that contracts with Micron **and has possibly exposed employees after returning from Seattle**.\n\nHe is going to see a doctor tomorrow and will probably get tested for beer flu. \n\n\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b get your puts ready.\n\nTL;DR - MU $40p 04/03 (gotta give it time to spread)", "created_utc": 1583983734.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fha1d0/dd_micron_puts/", "is_self": true}
