Yes--stay with me and we'll be so rich we'll have a lambo that floats like fucking shitty-shitty-bang-bang or whatever that gay ass movie was called.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the last three nights the overnight repo rate has skyrocketed and the Fed has had to step in and inject some *$84 billion* into the markets where highly collaterlized debt hit FUCKING 9%.  That's PAWN SHOP RATES, bruhs.  The Fed says \"oh well its end of quarter tax payments!\".  Wrong.  Wrong.  Wrong.  These assholes are lying to you.  This is the beginning of a **corporate debt crisis** of untold magnitude originally began with ZIRP and \"chasing yield\" that allowed highly capital intensive corporations like F to continuously roll over their \"high grade\" corporate debt for pennies on the dollar.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe last three nights was just the beginning and it's going to get much worse.  ZIRP (that's zero interest rate policy for the morons that just started reading books) allowed corporations to issue massive amounts of corporate debt for pennies on the dollar as investors chased real yields.  These corporate debt coupons are paid monthly, quarterly or annually just like the mortgage and property tax you pay on the shitty fixer-upper you bought after binging on HGTV for a few days.  When they pay these coupons they need **COLD HARD CASH** just like you do, and if there's a cash crunch they can borrow it from overnight repo markets by putting up an asset (collateral) and retrieving cash (fucking cash) and then repay it overnight--hence \"REPO\" = \"REPOSSESSIVE\".  Are you still reading?  Keep fucking reading.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell guess what?  Three days ago CORPORATIONS NEEDED CASH SO BAD THEY HAD TO PAY UPWARDS OF 9% BEFORE THE FED JUST PRINTED 86 BILLION OUT OF THIN AIR.  Yes... it was paid back the next day... but this is just the beginning.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWages are finally rising which aids in retail cash flow, but now **TARIFF MAN** has showed up on the scene to FIX THE WORLDS PROBLEMS and is increasing material price inputs.  Interest rates are rising that increase financing costs for corporates and labor prices are increasing AND NOW MATERIAL PRICES.  What's left?  What's fucking left?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WELL ITS THE BROWN LIQUID THAT MAKES THE WORLD GO AROUND -- OIL.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAND OIL IS GOING TO GOT THROUGH THE ROOF because Trump wants to start a war to prop up his abysmal approval ratings, give a hand job to the Saudi's AND blow Putin all at the same time (and who really doesn't enjoy a good bombing?)   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd what do people buy based on the price of oil?  TRUCKS.  And what the FUCK DOES FORD SELL?  Potatoes!  No, Eric, the answer is fucking **TRUCKS**. (FORD = TRUCKS IF YOU'RE JUST JOINING)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRising wages.  Corporate debt crisis.  Rising material costs.  Oil shock.  What the fuck does this have to do with the peso?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn order to keep paying the corporate debt coupons, they will need to improve cash flow by having a firesale on assets and converting them to USD to pay their bond holders (PAID IN CASH--USD--NOT PESOS).  They will liquidate foreign assets to collect cash (SELLING IN PESO AND BUYING USD) which will have the effect of TANKING THE PESO.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**LONG FORD PUTS JANUARY 2022.**\n\n  \n**SHORT THE PESO.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***LAMBOYACHTTTTT***", "created_utc": 1568914951, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d6hiwf/ford_is_going_bankrupt_in_18_months_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
