First the modem business and now the NAND business. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoogle translate:\n\n\\&gt;  According to the micro-network report (Reporter Chen Baoliang), on July 11th, the company was informed that Hynix plans to acquire Intel's Fab 68 plant in Dalian, China. According to informed sources, \"According to the current progress, **Hynix is \u200b\u200bnegotiating with Intel. Hynix wants to acquire the entire Intel Dalian plant and** **3D NAND** **business. Intel only retains** **the technology related** **to X** **P** **oint.** \" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis seems like an interesting move by Intel as their Non-volatile memory group has seen a lot of revenue growth in the last few years. However, it may be that NAND is such a commoditized product that they think they can save money by buying NAND on the open marketing and producing their SSDs with that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot sure how the market will react to this, I'm guessing it'll be positive for Intel and probably a negative for Micron because everyone hates Micron for some reason.", "created_utc": 1562886716, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cc2uhl/rumor_intel_to_sell_3d_nand_business_to_sk_hynix/", "is_self": true}
