ONLY 1 MAN, rest 4 are all women. are you telling me Asian women are better at semiconductor engineering than Asian men? once again, huge gynocentric bias. its almost certain that Asian guy is highly competent because he's subject to the same strict criteria as a \"normal\" white male applicant, while the 4 Asian women are most likely not and chosen because of their gender and being a minority (despite the fact that being an Asian man brings no advantage at all despite being a minority)\n\n\n&gt;Intel named to the NAFE Top 50 Companies for Executive Women.\nThe National Association for Female Executives (NAFE) list celebrates U.S. companies that have programs and policies in place that promote the advancement of women, including training, accountability and succession planning. This year marks the 6th time Intel has been recognized on NAFE\u2019s list of top companies for executive women. \n\nJFL at the blatant gender discrimination\n\nFor those who don't know, Intel has fucked up their CPU roadmap. It's been stuck at 14nm for 5 years and the 10nm process has been delayed again and again. And investors and gamers are not happy about it. \n\nTheir former CEO,  Brian Krzanich, was fired for failing to deliver 10nm. To avoid admitting Intel has screwed up their technology, the official reason for his firing was for him having relationship with a female coworker LOL talking about a fucking hypocrite (he wouldn't be fired for that reason or excuse, if he actually delivered the 10nm). and now a bean counter is the new CEO and been in charge. Under that cuck Brian Krzanich, Intel was focused on identify politics, promoting women and blacks, as well as other PC stuffs such as declaring their CPUs \"conflict minerals free\". \n\nAll the nerds on reddit know Intel's 10nm fuckup, how it stagnated CPU tech by keep releasing 4 core mainstream products for 10 years rather than giving out more cores,  and how it allowed its rival AMD to catch up. None of them know the real reason, they just think its greed. The real reasons are far worse. It's because of cuckoldry, pussy worship, and mangina-ism.", "created_utc": 1577904978, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eim1g2/real_reason_intel_why_failed_to_deliver_10nm_for/", "is_self": true}
