{"id": "fynd7u", "title": "It\u2019s not the confirmation bias that you want to hear. But here is the case that we are in a new bull market.", "selftext": "To preface this. My gut had been telling me we are going to drop below the Mar 23 lows again with all the bad news still coming, record unemployments, missed mortgage and lease payments etc.\n**But my brain is now telling me we will not revisit the bottom again related to the pandemic crisis** (lows will be hit again only if we have another black swan event, like a sudden nuclear war or impending asteroid impact)\n\n\n1.) Government action was lightning swift and aggressive compared to the GFC. The pandemic occurred well before the upcoming elections, which means Congress didn\u2019t need to wait for months to act like in 2008. The first round of 2 trillion dollar stimulus was passed on March 27. Second and FURTHER rounds are upcoming, and even JPow has encouraged it in statements made yesterday: \n\n>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Thursday said it would \"absolutely\" be a good idea for Congress to pass additional fiscal stimulus to support a U.S. economy frozen by nonessential business closures and social distancing guidelines implemented to stem the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n2.) As everyone knows now, yesterday the Fed is also going to expand their plans to buy up junk corporate bonds and give out money to midsize businesses, and state/local governments to the staggering tune of 2.3 trillion. \n\n3.) Yesterday also JPow indicated the Fed will likely bailout private company mortgage servicers such as Quicken Loans, Freedom Mortgage Corp etc:\n\n> \u201cWe\u2019re watching carefully the situation with the mortgage servicers,\u201d Mr. Powell said in an interview with the Brookings Institution, hours after the Fed announced new programs to provide up to $500 billion in credit to state and local governments and $600 billion to midsize companies.\n\n>Mr. Powell on Thursday noted that the mortgage companies make up \u201ca key market that does support households and consumer spending, really, which is of course 70% of the economy.\u201d\n\n4.) COVID deaths are lower than expected and peaking earlier than expected. Markets are assuming high probability of reopening the economy sooner than anticipated \n\n5.) On March 15, JPow slashed interest rates to ZERO. The equity risk premium has shifted much higher. Why should institutional investors buy treasuries that are yielding less than the rate of inflation, when they can jump into stocks for the comparatively juicy dividend and increased ERP?\n\n6.) Smart money and institutions have realized far far earlier than you, that the record unemployment right now is much less impactful than the trillions pumped in by Fed and government. Why? Well thanks to the massively insane income/wealth inequality in this country, if you look at the 16 million record unemployment claims and add up the total income lost, they are comprising only 0.3% of the total personal income. That\u2019s right- ZERO POINT FUCKING THREE. Markets don\u2019t give a fuck that POOR people in the restaurant, travel, and retail industries lost their jobs.\n\n7.) When you look at the 1987, 2002, and 2008-2009 crashes, whenever the stock market had recovered 50% of the losses, it was already well on its way to completing the next high of the new bull market. If we close above 2792.69 on SPX, it will be confirmation that the bottom had already passed. And if you also look at the prior crashes, recovery to 50% takes about half the time it took to crash. \nWe fell for six weeks, and now 3 weeks from the march 23 bottom we are already closing in on 50%. \nIt also takes three times the duration of crashing to reach ATH if you look at the prior events- meaning we could be SPY 330 before September or October.\n\n8.) In every recession related crash, markets have ALWAYS bottomed BEFORE jobless claims PEAKS. They have ALWAYS bottomed BEFORE consumer sentiment bottoms out. Waiting for fundamentals to get better means you missed the lows long long ago.\n\n\n9.) Finally. Institutional investors and pensions have been selling at the \u201chighs\u201d of the market throughout the last two years. Retail and households were buying heavily during that period (see table in  https://m.imgur.com/a/LLE44va) Stock buybacks were propping the market up in 2019. You can now bet your bear ass that institutions were and are still pouring the cash on the sidelines right into the dips and recent March 23 bottom, while you, the horrified retail investor, either sold at the low or are currently staying short and are now flabbergastingly foaming at the mouth sputtering \u201cBuT It HAs to Go dOWn\u201d\n\nSPY 330 Sept 30 calls", "created_utc": 1586548489.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fynd7u/its_not_the_confirmation_bias_that_you_want_to/", "is_self": true}
