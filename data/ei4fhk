I do no DD, I don't look at fundamentals, and I have missed 10/10 of the epic stock moons so far in history. Ever since starting options, I'm down 36% YTD while the market has been up 28%. So for all the people who've been in the red, I present to you your first opportunity to make money in 2020.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am in on NFLX 31st Jan 320 Puts. Inverse me for your first win of the year", "created_utc": 1577806988, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ei4fhk/inverse_me/", "is_self": true}
