I got in this morning at $12 and got warrants at $3.\n  \nVTIQ merging with Nikola Motors.  Makes the deal worth $3.3B.  Came on CNBC today and said that the company should be valued at $100B due to their sales.  14,000 trucks reserved.  $800M reserved from Anheuser Bush.  Total reservations total $8.8B.  More reservations and purchases to be announced soon.\n\nI'm trying to be quick here as this thing is going to the freaking moon right now.  \n  \nI'll update later with more info, but look into it.  \n  \nVTIQ for equity\n  \nVTIQW for warrants (exercise price of 11.50, expiry 5 years)\n  \nSAME SHIT AS SPCE AND SPCEWS, THIS WILL MOON.  NO ONE ELSE DOING HYDROGEN PICK UP TRUCKS AND SEMIS.  COMPETITION TO TESLA\n  \n**Due Diligence:**\n  \n-Nikola was founded in 2014.  As stated on CNBC, they have a moat around their company now because they are the only ones who have working hydrogen fuel technology.\n  \n-The are building the world's only hydrogen infrastructure and it was stated that all other hydrogen-powered vehicles will use their infrastructure, as well - it wont be just for Nikola.\n  \n-Elon Musk says hydrogen vehicles is impossible.  Personally, I think he's worried about losing market share and afraid of the competition it can create, especially since Elon is looking into semi trucks himself.\n  \n-Nikola deal was backed by Fidelity Investments with $500M+ invested by them.\n  \n-Nikola confirmed Anhueser Bush made an $800M reservation in their move to make a more sustainable play for the company.\n  \n-Total of $4B in pre-orders.\n  \n-Nikola founder says more deals were just signed in the last few days and will be announced soon.\n  \n-28M share float, not including the warrants and units.\n  \n-Deal values the company at $3.3B.  They believe the company's valuation should be $100B based on forward revenue (per CNBC interview)\n  \n-Backed by Jeffrey Ubben, hedge fund investor , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_W._Ubben\n  \nUbben took a $2B stake in MSFT back in 2014:  https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2014/04/02/jeffrey-ubbens-hedge-fund-is-the-big-microsoft-winner/#2d5336db2444\n  \nSEC prospectus:  https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1731289/000110465920028233/tm2011332d1_ex99-3.htm\n  \nFurther readings from SEC filing:  https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1731289/000110465920028233/tm2011332d1_ex10-2.htm\n  \n**Disclosure**\n  \nNot financial advise.
