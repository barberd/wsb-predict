{"id": "grzgvt", "title": "$SDC Squeeze Possible", "selftext": "**SDC Short Squeeze Setup**\n\nWas looking at SDC very closely today as we've had higher lows despite high short interest in this stock since last Friday. I've posted my chart below with analysis. I'd call this \"light\" TA since I really only utilize exponential moving averages and fib lines as support/resistance points, and outside of that I'm looking at volume and price action. In fact, I love situations like this where volume and price action show a strong rebuttal against predictions that TA may give you (see chart).\n\nAs of 5/13/2020 SDC had 56% short interest (see https://www.highshortinterest.com/) and a decent float. Combine that with the notes here: https://www.tradingview.com/x/r7RJTeGm/\n\nTo get to the point, read chart, put a position if you want, or don't. Not financial advise. \n\nThe way I'm playing this - look for a quick move upwards by EOW, if not, exit, even if at a loss. If this puppy doesn't move quickly with that amount of short interest the hypothesis will no longer be acceptable with my trade requirements.\n\n**tl;dr Volume/Price action/Resistance Pts make me think SDC will get short squeezed in the very near future**\n\nPosition: 6/19 $8 Calls (my cost was $0.70, for transparency)\n\nEDIT 5/28 12:51am: Looks like retail bros sold SDC today :thinkingface: https://robintrack.net/symbol/SDC", "created_utc": 1590640303.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/grzgvt/sdc_squeeze_possible/", "is_self": true}
