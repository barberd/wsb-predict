But I'll still tell you asshats how to make a hammock of tendies. \n\nTLDR: Activision has somehow managed to make themselves (mind you, they were already Activision; basically the read headed stepchild of the gaming industry PR-wise) less popular than herpes within their entire userbase (assuming every person taking the time to read this is an absolute idiot, that's a bad thing). \n\nTLDR 1.5: Well, well, (meme), why is that a problem Doctor Genius (yeah, that's my chosen name)?\n\nBECAUSE THEY ARE NOW 100% FUUUUUCKED!\n\nTLDR 2.0 (It's one of those sequels that is better than thte.. fuck it)\n\nActivision now has 2 (two, dos.. yeah you get it) choices. And both of those is a HUGE fucking disaster. \n\n1. Backpaddle. Walk back their censorship, fire people, and make things 'right' in the U.S./Euro Markets. \n2. Stay the line. Well, this is just my damn opinion but. . Yeah, with the current MASSIVE actions by their user base, gaming community, media etc. They are still 'net fucked'. \n\nSo.. get with me you jazz loving cocaine hobbits. I have no idea what the point here was. I'm short ATVI, but I'm also a stoned muppet so.. yeah.", "created_utc": 1570686248, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dftk4k/on_a_scale_from_light_treason_to_tiananmen_square/", "is_self": true}
