{"id": "hcs3e5", "title": "BABA", "selftext": "From a business perspective, everything I have read about BABA seems incredibly promising. They have strong financials with increasing revenue, including ~98 billion in revenue from a recent sales campaign that ended on June 18. They are also diversifying where there revenue is coming from, such as by investing in their cloud computing division Alibaba Cloud. In fact, they recently just announced they will be hiring an additional 5000 employees for their cloud computing services. And to top it off, they seem to have strong leadership that is consistently focused on long term growth. All of this while going through a global pandemic.\n\nHowever, I think there are many issues that they face in the U.S. market. Alibaba is frequently referred to as the Chinese Amazon, but I feel that many U.S. investors are skeptical of the figures they're reporting because laws governing such reporting are much more lenient than for U.S. companies. Then there are the issues with U.S./China trade relations. And of course, the shares we get on the NYSE are simply held in a holding company in the Cayman Islands.\n\nSo my big question is how much faith do we put in a company that looks amazing, but has many different caveats that could make the stock troublesome to own? I think the stock has great potential, but it just seems so risky. I'd love to load up on calls and hope for an OTM return, but it seems too  good to be true.", "created_utc": 1592680923.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hcs3e5/baba/", "is_self": true}
