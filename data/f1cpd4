{"id": "f1cpd4", "title": "Short term call options vs LEAP call options", "selftext": " Guys, serious question here.\n\nWhy are most of you buying short term option calls (weeks to a month out) rather than buying a year long leap call options?\n\nJust because it's cheaper and you can buy more? Does it have more potential for gains because you can buy more options? How does theta value play into this?\n\nI am thinking about buying call options for ALIBABA ahead of its earnings report on 2/13, and I initially planned buy 2/14 FDs at $220 strike price but realized I dont want to bet all my money against coronavirus making BABA stonks go down despite baba beating expectations.\n\nSo I am now leaning towards Jan/2021 at $250\\~270 strike price, which are much more expensive and I can only buy a couple of them, but at least I wont get fucked should stocks go down. My question is, if the baba stonks DO go up, say to $ 230 level, how much gains am I missing out if I bought 10 2/14 FDs rather than 4 jan/2021 leap calls?\n\nI am trying to understand how the variables affect each other and having a hard time understanding why people in WSB seem to prefer shorter term call options than leap calls. Given the nature of you autists, the reason is obviously for more tendies, but what's the mathematical basis behind it? Optimising theta?\u00a0 Can anyone explain this to me?\n\nThank you all very much.", "created_utc": 1581272848, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f1cpd4/short_term_call_options_vs_leap_call_options/", "is_self": true}
