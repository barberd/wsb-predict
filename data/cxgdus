I called the tweet the day before the \u201ccollapse\u201d of August 23. \n\nAugust 5: SPY goes to $278 after hours on Monday. \nAugust 6: SPY miraculously opens at $285.\n\nAugust 25: ES goes to $2810 on Sunday at 6pm (roughly SPY $281)\nAugust 26: SPY miraculously opens at $287. \n\n**Trump** does not want SPY to fall below $280. If reports are true, and Trump lied about the phone calls over the weekend, just to bring the markets back to live, then we may not see SPY below $280 soon. Last time we were below $280?
