DD inside.", "selftext": "The reason why the current cat bounce is stretched is cuz the drop was faster than anything ever before and partly because JPOW has been cock-blocking all the bad news. I would add a chart for you retards but I am a retard my self and don't know how to insert it so words will have to do. If you look at past charts, the dead cat bounces have turned back from the 50 DMA. Happened in 08 and in 18. What I am saying is we are close, closer than ever before. Right now its looking like 295 as the intersection with the 50 DMA. \n\nCurrently cash gang but dropping 25K on 6/19 250P at open on Monday.", "created_utc": 1586621540.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fz8h1n/fellow_gay_bears_the_tendies_are_close_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
