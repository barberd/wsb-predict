To quickly bring you up to speed, Hertz had concerns of going bankrupt and needed an extension to pay off the debt. This extension ends tomorrow 5/22 to pay off some $400m which I think they have the capital to do ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hertz-seeks-lender-leniency-faces-110000740.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hertz-seeks-lender-leniency-faces-110000740.html) ). Is anyone else playing this? I could see $HTZ sky rocketing, BIG IF TRUE. How should I play this and are you playing this? I have some $5c 6/19. Thoughts on closer/further exp date, higher/lower strike price? I've never played with fire like this bad boy.", "created_utc": 1590088161.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/go32s1/htz_panic_guy_checking_back_in/", "is_self": true}
