{"id": "gn3nc1", "title": "Nasdanq and Unemployment Reach Record Highs! BULL THEORY", "selftext": "The coming months are a time for all time highs! Let me lay out the bull case! 'Murica!\n\nCurrently, all time highs in corona cases, corporate debt, zombie companies, corporate CEO compensation, corporate bankruptcies, consumer debt, unemployment, and deaths!\n\nBest of all, we're right on track to hit all time highs for consumer bankruptcies, consumer mortgage foreclosures (6 months), bank stress (after mortgages die), populist upheaval to give away more free shit (mass unemployment).\n\nPotentially, but not likely is increased tensions, possible war with, new world power China.\n\nWhat does all of this mean? Well it's good news. Why? Because nothing worse can happen!! We've already got all the bad news!! Fk off gaybears!\n\nSee, game theoretical optimal outcome is stonks hit record highs in a few months.\n\nI'm going to lay down the end game here. The market will rally to all time highs in June/July before tapering off waiting for the election, then rallying to more all time highs.\n\nHow is this possible? Well I'll tell you. Just buy my free online course ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0)).\n\nThink about it, the rich elite are the ones in power. You think for a second they will let their \\~trillions\\~ of dollars in stonks go down. Think again. They will do whatever it takes to stop that and use this event as an opportunity to squeeze the little guy every way they can into an even stronger position of economic slavery.\n\nBut really tho? Well, game theoretically, the only new news is good news for resolutions to all of the bad stuff I just mentioned. Or, if there is some unexpected bad news which would be pretty hard to get at this point, everyone now knows that Powell will just brrrrrrrr asset prices and credit lines for zombies. The only outcome is stonks up, real estate up.\n\nMark my words - this summer we will see headlines like \"Unemployment and Nasdaq hit record highs!\", \"Wave of corporate bankruptcies pushes markets to all time highs\", \"US declares war on China  \n, brings manufacturing back to America\", \"China drops nuke, Powell assures markets\", etc.\n\nSo, using stochastic calculus and optimal neutrino theory, we can see the best strategy is simply to buy stonks. But since we know we have a high probability of success we can increase our profits by using \\~leverage\\~.", "created_utc": 1589944645.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gn3nc1/nasdanq_and_unemployment_reach_record_highs_bull/", "is_self": true}
