{"id": "haqawi", "title": "The GUH Heard Around the World", "selftext": "It is 6/17 of the year 2030. You wake up at the designated time thanks to the screech of your assigned alarm. The noise pierces your brain, doubly so after echoing off the bare metal walls of your dark room. Mechanically, you open your phone and watch the sponsored Rokugle\u00a9\ufe0f content required to silence the shrill cries. The bright colors and soft hissing of the released dopamine gas fill you with joy as you see the CEO of America, your lord and savior Jay Powell The Printer, appear on the screen you toiled so hard for.  \n\nIt was 10 years ago to the day that you you bought those fateful ROKU 7/17/2020 240c\u2019s. Before June\u2019s end ROKU was acquired by Google and you were so ecstatic to have finally made something of yourself. Looking for that fabled 10,000 bagger however, you held on for dear life. By July 4th, Google along with every other corporation was bought up by the Fed- save for a single supposedly cursed company. Prices went to the moon as truly infinite QE became priced in. Ah yes, those were the days. When men were men who fought bears, tendies were real tendies, and kangaroos only an Australian marsupial wholly unrelated to the stock market. Of course by now inflation meant those gains were nearly worthless, but they were enough to buy a top shelf phone in order to see each and every illustrious pore of Jpow\u2019s face in 16k ultra definition. \n\nJay Powell\u2019s voice is an anthem of truth and victory as he announces that repo operations are going smoothly and will be increasing from 250T to 300T nightly. You shiver. Powell assures you almost personally that the Fed will use the full extent of their power- indeed every tool in their toolbox- until America is safe. Pure bullish ecstasy courses through your veins.\n\nThe announcement ends but the presence of The Printer lives on inside you, urging you onward to productivity. Or perhaps that\u2019s just the neural implant. Nonetheless you make your way to your designated work station tucked away in the corner of your room. From a boxy speaker emerges a word, a silver toned instruction which graces your ears and entwines itself with your very being.\n\n\u201cPrint\u201d peals the voice of Jay.\n\nYou obey. \n\nYou hold shift and your palms start sweating. Then you gingerly press \u201cb\u201d. Anticipation builds. You release the two keys. A flawless \u201cB\u201d appears on the terminal. Your heart races. It is finally time. Your eyes fervently turn to the key you know to be \u201cr\u201d even though the lettering on it had long ago been worn away. You voraciously hold it down as you crane your neck up to gaze back to the screen. \n\n\u201cBrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr\u201d is printed in a pleasantly bland font on an equally bland background. You cannot contain it anymore and a euphoric moan escapes your lips, only to be echoed back at you and redoubled by the voices of your neighbors and indeed the entire American working class as they too all Print. You know it is but a fraction of divinity as compared to Jay as he sits locked upon his Printer Throne. He dedicates the entirety of his almighty JPower to convert the \u201cBrr\u201d signals into liquid currency to print the USA into safety while kindly reassuring the good people that all is well. You release the \u201cr\u201d key eight rapturous hours later. \n\nOnly one more task sits between you and a piping hot plate of Beyond Meat tendies. Your sharpen your senses and steel your will to a razor point in order to execute a dire task, one integral to the continued function of the Greatest Country on Earth. Yesterday, someone had committed the most heinous of crimes and justice demanded it be corrected. A single order for a SPY 220p had been discordantly placed, which deviated algorithms from their perfect 12% upward trend. A Dip was created and it threatened all of society. When you heard it the news your blood boiled in righteous fury. How dare someone bet against America?! So you volunteered to go to the front lines and fight. \n\nAnd fight you will, so you open the Robinhood app and place an order for 50 7/17 SPY 330c\u2019s. It fills. Relief washes your anger away. America is now safe. As you go to exit the app however, your fat thumbs accidentally buy another option as well. An evil chill settles down your spine as you see something you thought impossible mere moments before; it was not an option on SPY. You go to cancel the order, but long hours of printing have dulled your reflexes. Too slow. Robinhood notifies you that they are experiencing server issues and cannot cancel the order. Your breath catches in your throat. The lights in your building shut down, and even your trusty tendy microwave\u2019s time readout is empty and lifeless. You are cast into claustrophobic, all consuming darkness. \n\nMoments lasting an eternity pass and in the distance you hear a furious angelic droning. \n\u201cBrr\u201d \nMaybe they\u2019ll understand it was a mistake, you reason. It gets louder.\n\u201cBrrrrrr\u201d\nThey won\u2019t understand. Your ears are ringing now.\n\u201cBrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr\u201d \nHow could it have gone so wrong? \n\u201cBRRRRRRRRR\u201d\nThe outer wall of your room is torn asunder and your nostrils are assaulted by the acrid outside air while the sound of printing engulfs you, almost subsuming your entire sense of self. Pieces of something- you realize it is shards of your wall- whizz past your ears in a flurry. The droning revs up, and the all-consuming \u201cBRR\u201d climaxes with a trio of wet thuds. It takes a moment to realize the thuds came from your own body as you look incredulously down at three of fat stacks of $100 bills sticking halfway out of your chest. Your shirt suddenly feels warm against your skin.\n\n\u201cDIRECT LIQUIDITY INJECTION COMPLETE.\u201d booms a metallic voice.\n\nThe voice\u2019s owner appears to be a gleaming throne of gold and printer-ink composite, illuminated by the twin jets of fire that propelled it through the night sky and through your wall. Stack upon stack of printed bills flow from the bowels of the great machine before you. Atop it sits a mythologically massive figure in a smartly cut suit, from whom a palpable pressure of printing prowess emanates across the room. This is the legendary Jay Powell in the flesh. Unnlike his typical flawless visage, of which you are intimately acquainted through 16k ultra definition streaming, there is an unfamiliar glint marring his features. It is a single teardrop that catches and bends the thrones flames and thus itself burns away the darkness. The sight eats away at your soul and brings you even worse pain than the very literal and extremely physical wounds in your chest. You failed America. You failed Him. \n\n\u201cYou are not the first nor will you be the last. I have no choice, for I must use all tools available. For what it is worth however, I am sorry my child\u201d says the voice that had comforted you every morning, but instead of the usual triumphant tones it is weary and hollow. \n\nYour fingers are cold. You try to wiggle them in vain as your eyes find Jay\u2019s. You attempt to explain how it was a mistake and that you\u2019re sorry, but your voice fails you too. The cold creeps up your arms while your torso is too warm and wet. Why is it wet? You wonder idly that this cannot be real, but know deep down with frigid certainty that this is it. \n\nThe edges of your world fade while the radiant figure of Jay fills your vision. He plucks up your still-unlocked phone from a pile of dollars and debris, pushes his glasses up, and reads the screen. Without warning his powerful frame crumples in defeat like an ancient sun giving way to inevitable singularity.\n\n \u201cI am too late.\u201d he laments in barely more than a whisper.\n\nAs if to echo his grief, across America millions of voices cry out in a single unified GUH as their positions approach negative infinity. Then that too fades and all that remains is a broken room, a broken man, and a broken printer.\n\nA reflection of your phone screen remains in his spectacles. Staring back at you in his eyes is the option that brought tragedy and doom to you, to the once great Jay, and to the entire nation. The last thing you see as the coldness reaches your core is that accursed screen:\n\n\u201cWoohoo! \ud83d\ude3a Your order to buy to open 2 contracts of MSFT $200 call 7/17 has been filled at an average price of $4.20 per contract.\n\nYour order is complete.\u201d", "created_utc": 1592397461.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/haqawi/the_guh_heard_around_the_world/", "is_self": true}
