Even now I can see that happening\u2014just as clearly as I can see the vape smoke filled Bugatti in my future. \n\nThanks to this Subreddit, and my incredibly underdeveloped Statistical Reasoning IQ, I\u2019m probably going to make less mistakes in life than if I didn\u2019t make early mistakes here out the gate. \n\nFor example: I almost went gay for tax reasons until someone told me being single is actually p much the same overall breakdown as being married now. If it weren\u2019t for that wonderful learning opportunity, I\u2019d be sucking dicks for better healthcare right now. True story. \n\nIf you think you have something smart to post, put some effort into it so we know you\u2019re trying. And If you\u2019re constantly wrong, but have great writing skills, you should be a MM bot (wonderful career awaits, just not here). \n\nIn closing, just wanted to say thank you WSB for saving me from myself. \n\nMods are gay, Free Shkreli.", "created_utc": 1563671555, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cfterh/hey_morons_quit_wasting_space_pretending_like_we/", "is_self": true}
