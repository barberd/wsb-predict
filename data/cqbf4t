{"id": "cqbf4t", "title": "Fucked by Western Texas Intermediate /CL Futures", "selftext": "I shorted /CL at $55.04 after the EIA report and then it had a little run up to $55.32.  It didn't make sense to me that it would run up like that considering overall market is bearish with bond inversion and with crude inventories rising.  \n\nI had to stop out to avoid losing more on my contracts but I also had to take a leak real bad.  After that I went to piss and fill up my coffee. I also got a delicious bagel with chives-flavored cream cheese. While I was away /CL finally tanked to $54.15 and I lost out on about 80 ticks on a lot of 10 contracts.  \n\nTL;DR: Gave up $2,400 on  WTI crude futures when I could have made $8,000 because I was impatient had to piss real bad.\n\nOh, I also closed out my /ES short 15 minutes after market open instead of letting it ride. Regret that too.  I might just have to get in on some CGC calls and analfarmer my tendies back tonight. Basically flat for the day right now.", "created_utc": 1565797334, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cqbf4t/fucked_by_western_texas_intermediate_cl_futures/", "is_self": true}
