(You can see the by the minute price changes that closely follows TSLA).\n\nThe retard is only able to achieve that because the interest for SPCE has died drastically.\n\nSo if we all get puts on this mofo, it should teach the retard investor to not fuck with us\n\nPs. I got 20$ puts on 03/13 for SPCE. Mofo stock is not worth more than 10.\n\nOnce Richard Branson\u2019s rocket explodes, it will be worth .24 cents - the same as CHK", "created_utc": 1583342651, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fdgc6q/spce_some_retard_analyst_has_packaged_it_with_tsla/", "is_self": true}
