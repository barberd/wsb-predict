{"id": "fsk2uz", "title": "Reduced hours at work snd temporary lay offs", "selftext": "My company, office is in usa but our corporation is australian based, just announced some lay offs and everyone is on reduced hours from 1-2 days. We are a travel company, so this obviously isnt a surprise. However, what I can tell you is that the amount of cash on our balance sheet(not gonna link, its public info, my only hint will be that we trade on the asx and lost 80% of our value in the last month and trading is still halted for our stock) is 70% client cash. This means we collected it from customers but owe it to our suppliers and vendors. It means we report that as cash on hand but never actually realize it ourselves.\n\nThis illustrates how fucked many companies are. Even if they were solvent. All it takes is a few months without revenue and these companies cannot stay above water. No matter how much money any government throws at these corporations, it will not matter, because there is no customer base.\n\nDo not fall for this bull trap. All the stimulus has done is stop the bleeding, it has not resolved the problem, and it never will. My favorite quote for the current situation was here on wsb, \u201cthe government is throwing money at a problem that does not accept cash\u201d, this is what you need to remember every time you enter a trade. \n\nI am long theta for now since IV is still absurd. I am selling short strangles, with far otm puts, at least 10-20% below current, and atm calls. Looking to bag hold if assigned because of the vol.\n\nTickers:\nAMD, SQ, BYND, CVNA, ZS, Z, ROKU\n\nMore risky: PTON, LYFT, UBER\n\n\nEDIT:\nRemoving TWTR since thats just too autistic. Also pton, uber, and lyft are also risky to short at their current prices. Just pay attention to the relationship between major indices and the tickers you watch.", "created_utc": 1585684874.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fsk2uz/reduced_hours_at_work_snd_temporary_lay_offs/", "is_self": true}
