{"id": "f0dlni", "title": "Market just need to crash", "selftext": "Now, don't get me wrong. I am no gay bear who want to make money riding down the market (^(although i'll be taking advantage of it) ), but i just can't justify paying inflated prices for everything. Every reputable stock (especially those that i trade MSFT, NVDA, AMD etc.) is reaching its 52w or all time highs, so options are becoming riskier than usual. Now you could say, just buy puts, but as markets keeps getting pumped up with that sweet sweet FED green printing, other trade and despite corona virus news, i second guess my shit, and there is the whole thing about \"i am no gay bear\" you know. \n\nSo basically i believe we all would feel much better opening bullish positions if the market corrected a little bit and we don't feel like chasing the market all the time plus one seems to long overdue.
