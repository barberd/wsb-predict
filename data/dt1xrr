{"id": "dt1xrr", "title": "SNAP PUTS", "selftext": "First time posting my autism on WSB. Just spent the last 2 months losing about 5k on SPY short term puts and decided 100% portfolio diversity in my favorite short would be an appropriate way to gain it back. Chasing losses is cool here right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShort thesis:\n\n1) Snap makes ZERO money. I've done some projections applying 40% rev growth rate in 2020, 35% 2021, 30% 2022 and kept expense growth conservative. Current growth rate is about 45% FYI. Looks like itll be about 2022 until they show profit. 2023 they hit 1.2B in profit, which at a reasonable 20 PE ratio gets us to a 24B market cap, assuming expenses are kept under control. Today we're sitting at a cushy 20B market cap, big LOL. I can share my spreadsheet if anyone is interested, but who cares about math? \n\n2) Total market is in a bubble unlike anything we've seen. Slowly seeing a migration into value stocks over growth as people are realizing companies like uber, lyft \\*insert any cannabis stock\\*, and of course snap, do not make enough money (if any) to justify their valuations. Once this bubble begins to pop, which holy fuck we are due, these are all going to get SLAMMED. Huge gains to be made shorting the downside, while what is the potential upside gain holding Snap here with the market at ATHs? Obviously I'm trying to time the market here a bit, which is why I'm im an idiot and have chosen longer term puts.\n\n3) Autisticly anecdotal, I'm mid 20s and have total seen this platform die off amongst my age group. Can't imagine this isn't viewed as a myspace one day; its functionally is completely replicable. Also anecdotally, the content snap is using to \"expand\" their platform fucking sucks. Who the hell uses discover for anything except checking out kylie jenner?\n\nLets fucking ride boys.", "created_utc": 1573151589, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dt1xrr/snap_puts/", "is_self": true}
