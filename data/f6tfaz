So, I want to write some interesting shit in return to WSB. \n\nAlso, I think if I post this on r/stocks or r/investing I would be considered a heretic, be condemned for not following the guidance of the holy Intelligent Investor and be prema banned for not looking at fundamentals, so I choose to post here.\n\nThis thread talks about a few market bubbles, history of space industry, the potential of SPCE and the rationale behind being the grand bubble stock.\n\nIs gonna be long, jump to the the bubble part if you are bored.\n\n\\-----\n\nPreface: \n\nDuring the 1995-2000 Dot com Bubble, there are so many companies + useless startups that could cash in so much money by simply building some shit and claim is the future. \n\nFor example, Netscape without even a hint of profitability skyrocketed as high as $74.75 per share on its first day of trading before finishing the day at $58.25. The closing price valued the web browser at around $3 billion. By the end of 1995, Netscape shares traded at $174. In 1999, AOL acquired Netscape during the height of the bubble in a deal valuing the company at $10 billion. \n\nThis is just one small internet stock that successfully suck the cash out from retards in the dot com bubble. The larger internet company names such as yahoo, AOL, E\\*TRADE, eBay, Priceline.com, and Amazon.com are tracked with the by the Bloomberg US Internet Index, Before and After Dot-com Bubble, the combined market values of the 280 stocks had fallen to $1.193 trillion currently from $2.948 trillion at their peak, a loss of $1.755 trillion. See 1.\n\nFrom a source I forgot, during the bubble in the US there are around 3-5 thousand ppl quit their jobs and do day trading full time, 5 mil people also joined in and invested some of their cash into the tech market. While we could say the people are retard in the 2000s and lose trillions on the bubble, some of these stocks ultimately become part of our society and we become heavily reliant on these companies. \n\nThe point is if a person could get in into some stock bubbles and get out alive before the burst, we could get so much tendies and waste it on useless shit. (Btw, there are always a few in the market, like the small 3d printing bubble in 2013, DDD&amp; SSYS goes to 100 and goes back down, currently it still hover around 10-20)\n\nSo, now I would want to talk about SPCE, the history, the billionaire space race and the potential reason to become a grand meme stock.\n\n\\-----\n\nSpace is only for the rich:\n\nIn 2004, there is a competition called the Ansari X Prize, basically a few teams compete to become the first company to build a spaceship to space. Guess which team win? The answer is Scaled Composites, which later formed the spaceship company with VG and is also the company that build white knight two, the mothership ship VG is still using today. In fact, SpaceShipOne the spaceship built in 2004 could reach 112 km which is still higher than today\u2019s VG SpaceShipTwo 90km. see 2.\n\nI even made a comparison photo here https://imgur.com/a/JpxcdMY , what I found was that after 15 years, while the vid quality improved quite a bit, the spaceship is mostly the same as in 2004, this is due to the fact that converting from a smaller prototype to a functional tourist spaceship is way harder then everyone could though. \n\n\u201cI believe that our real significance of this program is that realization,\u201d he said then, \u201cand I believe that realization will attract investment, and that realization will attract a whole bunch of activity and very soon it will be affordable for you to fly.\u201d - Burt Rutan, Engineer of SpaceShipOne in 2004 See 3.\n\nNow is Feb,2020 and we still haven\u2019t sent ordinary people to space without paying 50 mil to board a Souyz to space.\n\nI once read that software companies are so easy to generate money because you just need to write some code, make servers, sell your services easily to audience across the globe and you could already generate income without heavy overhead costs. \n\nBut Space industry on the other hand is simply expensive, it requires loads of cash for everything from launching, R&amp;D, staff, etc. Sending a kg of stuff cost around 2700 USD, the ISS costs around 150 BN should show you how expensive space is. Most participants that are in the Ansari X Prize (some are listed below) go bust.\n\nRocketplane- Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2010\n\nArmadillo Aerospace-Have around 1 mil USD of investment, but in hibernation mode since 2013\n\nXCOR Aerospace- Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2017\n\nUnlike Facebook where you could build it by a few ppl in Harvard, Space companies needs loads of initial investment, staff, expensive testing costs, years of development and high failure rate means it is simply impossible for people without at least a few millions/outside investors to start a space company let alone grow it into a successful space venture.\n\nThus, space is a billionaire race ground. Elon, Jeff and Branson is competing with each other, they are also interestingly the only 3 people that could make Reusable launch system. See 4\n\n\\-----\n\nReason that SPCE becomes a bubble meme stock: \n\nI think everyone now should get a glimpse on why there is so many successful internet companies but so few space companies. Space is like million dollars\u2019 + many years worth of hard and thus very few companies could become successful. But on the other hand, it gave the reason for SPCE to ascend into the ultimate meme stock.\n\nIn many stock market bubbles, no matter small or big like 3d printing, dot com, 2008 real estate bubble, railroad mania or the endless stock market bubbles there are always many companies that a person could invest in that sector. There are like hundreds of stocks to invest in the dot com bubble and at least dozens of 3d printing stocks to invest in the US, UK, China or in Europe \n\nBut what about space industry stocks? \n\nULA: Good luck pumping LMT and BA\n\nIridium: Starlink would likely make Iridium out of business, would not recommend.\n\nStarlink: There is likely the same or even more hype levels for Starlink then VG, but until there is an IPO, I won\u2019t count it, even then there is a IPO, there is only two stocks that everyone would mostly trade on, VG are also on different business then Starlink so zero competition between them\n\nBlue Origin: Bezos is not going to IPO it, he doesn\u2019t need to. His wealth is Blue Origin mkt cap and it currently weighs around 100+Bn\n\nSpaceX: Elon said he would not IPO SpaceX, so not an option too.\n\nChina, Russia, Japan, EU: Currently zero stocks that are passenger space/ communication related, all are either state owned or non-existence. \n\n\\-----\n\nThe Bubble: \n\nSo, here comes the point, if any fund manager unless it could buy into SpaceX via deals, normal person, boomer, millennials, people from other countries is going to buy into the space industry there is only Virgin Galactic that a person could buy (or you could buy Iridium which is gay and not recommended).\n\nWe all know space is going to be the future and yet I found it shocking that for an industry that has such huge potential, there are only 4 companies that represent the space industry and other are funded by governments, 2 are out of touch, ULA is only a small part of BA and LMT, so a person could only buy VG if it wants space to be a part of its portfolio.\n\nThis is a stark contrast to many stock bubbles where there are many choices that a person could invest on, you could buy an internet index back in the dot com boom or many real estate/bank stock choices for the 08 crisis. \n\nVG is the only one stock that 99% could invest on. I think this is the reason that would lead it to become a ultimate bubble stock, assuming even 0.1% of us stock investors which is around 100 thousand of people in the US invest 10k into the company, it would already add 1bn onto VG, 1 billion is pocket change for many large funds and if they want to be in part of the space race, most of them could only buy VG.\n\nEven a small news of relocation could jump the stock about 20% and is still up 40% since news release, imagine just releasing news such as day for launch, reopen sales, etc., when it eventually rides Branson I would not surprise it goes up 100%. After all, in the dot com bubble 500% increase from IPO is rather common, even QUALCOMM goes up around 2000% in the dot comm bubble and reach 88 in 2000, it only goes back to 88 recently and is now only 2 dollars up @ 90.56 in feb,2020. \n\nI think most people don\u2019t realize how this stock could be a stock in the history books, if according to history of how bubble stock forms, the bubble would grow for a while until it reaches hype point when the US goes back to the moon in 2024 and may burst or run for 1-2 more years. \n\nWhile it may be a large company in the 2030-2040 like how amazon is in the 2000 and it become today, we are talking about getting in, trade in a bubble and GTFO before things goes to shit. \n\n\\-----\n\nConclusion: \n\nVG is still the only stock that represent the hype and for anyone to invest into space industry. Even if you think my analysis is retard just please don\u2019t short the stock, you could not predict the only space stock that the public is allowed to put their money in would behave.\n\n1. https://money.cnn.com/2000/11/09/technology/overview/\n\n2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceShipOne\\_flight\\_17P\n\n3. https://spacenews.com/what-the-hell-happened-the-rise-and-fall-of-suborbital-space-tourism-companies/\n\n4.
