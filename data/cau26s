This week I learned a little bit about farming and the income I could make from it. One word: Ostriches. Raising these bad boys is super profitable. Eggs, leather, meat... Sell it all, just like the natives of old. So I asked my uncle if I could buy a few and raise them on his farm. We're in business. From here on out it's ostrich blood, boys. I broke out the old ouija board and drew some charts. You all know the process by now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have to admit I conjured up this chart voodoo last week, but it's turned out pretty well. We got LULU and NVDA on spotlight. I like these bad boys because they are meme stocks and have high growth potential. If you get into these trades now, you won't see max profit potential, but I still predict continuation of these trends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLULU broke out from a bull flag and is fast on its way to $192. The lines indicate $181 would have been a good entry point, $179 as stop loss and $192 as target. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/5lrjecx4j6931.png\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/zf29k6lwj6931.png\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got bad news for you all. NVDA is going south for a while. NVDA failed its breakout from an ascending triangle in March and is now forming a bearish flag pattern. The lines indicate that a good entry was $162, stop loss at $168, and a target of $140 (aggressive, I know).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/6s9oeve7j6931.png\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/40mf8i58j6931.png\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/r59q92jpk6931.png\n\nIf you didn't see last week's volume of Chart Voodoo and Dark Rituals, check it out [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c7hnlq/chart_voodoo_and_dark_rituals/) I covered NKE and predicted it would continue an iHS pattern.
