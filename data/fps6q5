{"id": "fps6q5", "title": "Core Inflation Numbers Tomorrow", "selftext": "You know the saying \"Don't fight the fed\".  I see a lot of posts from people trying to do just that.  But I also bought IWM at the beginning of the week, and doubled down on Tuesday.  Why?  Because, we were due a relief rally, and it was confirmed when the market completely ignored the 2.5 million jobless claims on Thursday.  That should give you some pause if you're holding short dated puts, or thinking about buying more.  Though, I admit, I bought 1 SPY put at 255 at the end of the day today, because I also believe this is insane.\n\nBut, back to it.  As long as people/investors believe that the Fed will make sure everything's going to be all right, nothing will dissuade them from that.  Unless the Fed starts being proved wrong.  The one thing  J Pow said that made me sit up is that this injection won't cause inflation to rise.\n\nOf course, there is the core inflation report, coming out tomorrow before open, though I don't think it will show any great increase.  Too afraid of being labeled a price gouger, and oil/gas prices are dropping.  According to this [study](https://www.richmondfed.org/-/media/richmondfedorg/publications/research/economic_quarterly/1995/spring/pdf/webb.pdf), there are some leading indicators that may indicate a rise in inflation.  If we can determine that inflation is actually rising, before the rest of THEM, we would know when to double down on our existing sad sack puts, rather than just waiting for the first big red candle.\n\nSo, the study has a list of 30+ of them.  Fine for academia, but we're looking to print before anyone else.  I narrowed it down.\n\nLabor: Unemployment, Weekly hours, Employed to population ratio (Check)\n\nMoney Supply: (Check!)\n\nCommodity Prices:  Futures of Gold/Silver/Zinc/IDK?  Not sure how to measure this, since gold/silver/oil have been moving in the same general direction.  Other suggestions?  Is there a total commodities index?  (never mind, I'll google that later).\n\nOthers:  [Suppliers](https://www.bls.gov/regions/new-york-new-jersey/data/xg-tables/ro2xgppihistind.htm) \\- Industrial commodities.  This is another governmental report.  Any purchasers out there willing to share their thoughts on the prices they're seeing within their industry?\n\nAny other things that J Pow said that were seemingly promised that we can track to possibly get a step ahead of the market, and not just hope and pray our puts will print?\n\n\\* Shout out to SonicMerlin on Stocktwits.  He said \" the moment confidence in the fed fails, the market is over.  It could drop 50% in a flash.  Ppl got a taste of that and they\u2019re too clouded to realize it\" which started this whole train of thought.\n\nPositions 4/17Puts GPS 5, LULU 125, SPY 150, BYND 25 5/15 CPB 36, 4/17 SPY 250 (1); Calls 4/17 IWM 130, 5/15 MJ 14, 9/18 29 XME\n\nAnticipated positions:  Holding what I got, going to go balls deep in puts as soon as the Fed fails\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1585291063.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fps6q5/core_inflation_numbers_tomorrow/", "is_self": true}
