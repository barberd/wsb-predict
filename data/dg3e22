{"id": "dg3e22", "title": "Morning Briefing (10/10/2019)", "selftext": "# Trade talk concerns weigh once again\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 futures currently trade six points, or 0.2%, below fair value in a volatile overnight session. Futures dropped as much as 1.1% below fair value on a report that deputy-level trade talks have yielded no progress on structural issues or on freezing additional tariff increases, but futures have mostly recovered amid a myriad of related trade headlines.\u00a0\n\nThe primary report was attributed to the\u00a0*South China Morning Post*, which also said that the Chinese delegation could leave earlier than expected. The White House reportedly denied this report to\u00a0*CNBC*, but then clarified that some officials may leave early.\u00a0*Bloomberg*\u00a0is reporting that a partial trade deal could include a previously agreed currency agreement.\u00a0\n\nOne takeaway is that the trade situation is always changing (expect more headlines), and the market will know more concrete details as soon as senior-level discussions begin today. Another takeaway is that although deputy officials are not final decision makers, the negative-sounding headline was enough to sour the mood after yesterday's trade-relief rally.\u00a0\n\nOn the data front, investors will receive the Consumer Price Index for September (Briefing.com consensus 0.1%) and the weekly Initial Claims (Briefing.com consensus 218,000) and Continuing Claims report at 8:30 a.m. ET.\u00a0\n\nU.S. Treasuries are little changed. The 2-yr yield and the 10-yr yield are both unchanged at 1.46% at 1.59%, respectively. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.4% to 98.73. WTI crude is up 0.2%, or $0.10, to $52.68/bbl.\u00a0\n\nIn U.S. Corporate news:\n\n* **Delta Air Lines**\u00a0(DAL 52.50, -1.42): -2.6% despite beating earnings estimates. The midpoint of its Q4 EPS guidance was below consensus, though.\u00a0\n* **Bed Bath &amp; Beyond**\u00a0(BBBY 12.07, +2.13): +21.4% after naming Mark Tritton as its new CEO. Mr. Tritton was most recently Exec VP and Chief Merchandising Officer at\u00a0**Target**\u00a0(TGT 109.50, -0.86, -0.8%).\u00a0\n* **Cisco Systems**\u00a0(CSCO 45.98, -0.86): -1.8% after the stock was downgraded to Neutral from Buy at Goldman Sachs with a price target of $48.\u00a0\n* **NetApp**\u00a0(NTAP 49.25, -2.12): -4.1% after the stock was downgraded to Sell from Buy at Goldman Sachs with a price target of $45.\u00a0\n\nReviewing overnight developments:\n\n* Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region ended Thursday on a mixed note, with markets in Japan and China finishing higher.\u00a0Japan's Nikkei +0.5%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng +0.1%, China's Shanghai Composite +0.8%, India's Sensex -0.8%, South Korea's Kospi -0.9%, Australia's ASX All Ordinaries -0.1%.\n   * In economic data:\n      * Japan's August Core Machinery Orders -2.4% m/m (expected -2.5%; last -6.6%); -14.5% yr/yr (expected -10.8%; last 0.3%).
