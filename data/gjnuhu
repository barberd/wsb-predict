Why should I hire a [Goldman Sachs analyst](https://www.dkrpa.com/blog/goldman-sachs-contradicts-its-own-investment-recommendations/) when here is an army of autists, all [willing to give constant DD for clout alone](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-26/reddit-s-profane-greedy-traders-are-shaking-up-the-stock-market). And speaking of clout, if I couldn't afford Netflix, I wouldn't mind cancelling; I mostly watch TikToks & educational YouTube videos nowadays anyway.\n\nI recently sent up a drone so that I can control it over mobile from anywhere in the world. I used [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/), [Ardupilot](https://ardupilot.org/), and a (free tier) AWS [Linux](https://ubuntu.com/) cloud server. Then set up cameras to watch that drone from a 3rd person perspective using [ZoneMinder](https://zoneminder.com/). All FOSS.\n\nThe [Google Summer of Code list of projects](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/?sp-page=5#4637931056136192) shows of some of the cool things that students are working on. People waited in line for 4 hours for Red Lobster. By now, we should all have [robot dogs](https://www.bostondynamics.com/spot) and [UAVs](https://droneag.farm/drone-spraying/) helping us take cake of our [permacultures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9ZukMyejLk) while other drones deliver supplies from our [equally well equipped neighbors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76GGZGneJZ4). According to one of the videos I linked, taking care of permaculture that produces enough food for 2 people and guests takes only 4 hours of work a week.\n\nInstead, we're waiting on Uber to deliver us [self-driving cars](https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-uber-may-end-self-driving-projects-covid-19-2020-5?r=US&IR=T), on Tesla for the exactly same thing + [space travel](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/nasa-tesla-spacex-elon-musk-model-x-car-astronauts-demo-2-rocket-launch-us-a9514256.html). Amazon for the same thing as \\*that\\* + food security. And then Google for all the above + we're letting them \"manage\" all the Open Source projects that are very obviously going to become the backbone of a future tech-focused and global society.\n\nI think that instead of throwing money at billion-dollar companies, hoping for a 2% return on our .0000001% \"ownership\" of said company, we should be throwing our support (and maybe a little money) behind these open source projects.
