{"id": "cypase", "title": "The Maxx case (pun intended) for $BA tendies", "selftext": "As I'm sure everyone is aware of the current Boeing crisis in the event that you are autistic outside of this subreddit here is a quick TLDR:\n\nBoeing plane crashes, kills many people. Month or so later same type of Boeing plane crashes, kills many other people. \n\nImmediately after second crash international agencies ground halt said Boeing plane. In very unusual and awkward move, FAA attributes fault of crashes to everything BUT the plane. After several days of being the only agency in world permitting this plane to fly, and under very heavy scrutiny, FAA ground plane as well. This all happened 5+ months ago.\n\nBoeing has incurred 8+ billion dollars in expenses continuing productions and storage and maintenance of said aircrafts while not being able to receive a dollar in return because payment is received only upon delivery of new aircrafts. \n\nIt is very obvious that the global level of scrutiny surrounding this plane is unlike anything we have ever seen regarding a commercial aircraft/vehicle. Not to mention that this aircraft can potentially provide a swing of .06% to the USA GDP! Mango man needs this airplane back in the air just as badly as Boeing does. Airlines need this plane back in air to stop their pockets from bleeding while they cancel flights and lease other aircraft to make up the canceled routes. Needless to say, there is 500$billion of global commerical aircraft industry that need this back up in the skies.\n\nHowever:\n\nWould you voluntarily fly on this plane ? If given the opportunity to fly on a different aircraft ( all airlines have said they will be required to inform when booking air travel what type of aircraft it will be) would you request a change? \n\nIf you are a regulator or agency, are you putting your name and reputation on the line certifying this plane to fly again? Seems like a doomsday question but in all seriousness, if it was to be certified and another crash occurs, the blame will no longer be focused on Boeing. The FAA will be subject to lawsuits upon lawsuits as well as all international agencies. \n\nBoeing as a company obviously cannot keep things status quo for that much longer. Maximizing shareholder value of a 200+b company is number one goal but at what cost? Billions in expenses with nothing coming back in is not sustainable. They should have halted production months ago but they thought they had the upper hand and this \"software fix/glitch\" will get em out of the shitter in no time. Obviously they cannot come out and say we fucked up made an incomplete plane and sorry we will no longer make/sell this plane anymore. Not to mention airline surveys and customer sentiment will be more than obvious about public's desire to fly on that death trap. Let's not forget mango man's tweet  suggesting that they change the name of their aircraft to get rid of the rotten taste in everyone's mouth. \n\nBoeing will need to have a scapegoat. In this case it will be the FAA.   There will be 100% collusion. FAA and international agencies will be forced to keep delaying and delaying decision because at the end of the day nobody is going to want to be on the other end of that red emergency phone call that another max plane went down. \nBoeing will be able to blame the FAA in order to limit their liability exposure to lawsuits and cancelled orders. \n\nBoeing has put the whole kitchen sink into this airplane and needs to find a way out ASAP.  The stock will get wrecked BUT it will recover because they have other aircraft that they sell successfully. However if this plane gets re-certified and there is ANOTHER CRASH, this stock will be worthless. They know this. It's a hard pill to swallow accepting the lesser of 2 evils, but in this case for Boeing it is a must for them to survive. \n\nTLDR TLDR: Boeing stock will see a 10-20% haircut within the next few months. The longer they wait to announce production halt, the more dollars coming out of their pockets. \n\nI will personally be buying weekly 300p's for the next 6-8 weeks in anticipation of said production halt announcement. \n\nAnd for all you haters, ask yourselves why the first announcement Boeing made to share holders was that they would be halting their stock buyback program.", "created_utc": 1567432690, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cypase/the_maxx_case_pun_intended_for_ba_tendies/", "is_self": true}
