It's been about a year since I fond this place and made the mistake of applying for options with Fidelity and TD Ameritrade. I have done plenty of autistic stuff since then as you may recall. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Selling puts to capitalize on the high implied volatility \\(IV\\) in biotech is basically free money.](https://i.redd.it/yu1c3jij1u131.png)\n\nI was, and still am, determined to find success in the world of options. Maybe not so much to get rich but rather to generate consistent results. The autistic part of me is fascinated by how money can be siphoned from the lightning fast back and forth of meaningless numbers on a screen and the mathematics behind it.\n\nIn my various research and readings I have established the following trading strategies which I will put forth here. This will be autistic reeeeee for the experienced but hopefully for anyone in the same place I was it may offer some insight ... or will die in new, or even more likely, be deleted by the mods.\n\nAs a disclaimer, whenever I learn something new (even from you folks, so fuck my shit up) I make adjustments to my strategies. Not all strategies work in all markets so while these might do fine in our bull market right who knows what will happen in the future. That's just part of the learning and growth which is often painful. *These are just ideas and observations. This is not investment advice.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Strategy A: Earnings Trade**\n\nSell far out of the money (OTM) cash-secured put the day before an earnings release. The goal is to sell the option when the implied volatility (IV) is highest secondary to the upcoming earnings release. IV typically drops after an earnings release allowing profit from the decay in vega (also known as IV crush).\n\n* Strike: variable and at your discretion. You can look back to see the maximum percentage rise or fall in the share price after an earnings release and aim to have a strike at least that amount if not more (such as -10, 15, or 20% below the current stock price). Choosing a strike closer to the money results in a higher yield but assumes more risk that the stock price might fall below the chosen strike if earnings is poor. Note that past performance does not predict future results so even if past moves have never exceeded 7% something horrible could happen and it could drop 15 or 20% (e.g. a rogue wave).\n* Expiry: choose the closest expiry immediately following the earnings date. Alternatively, chose the expiry following the week of earnings release to yield higher premium due to higher time value (theta). This is especially helpful for earnings later in the week (e.g. Thursday or Friday).\n* Risk: the share price falls lower than your selected strike and the option is exercised at expiry. The acquired shares can be held long term until the share price recovers, sold immediately for a loss, or held to sell covered calls against.\n\nExit the position once 50%+ profit.\n\nI often get asked about buying downside protection to limit the potential losses, also known as a bull-put credit spread. This is absolutely an option. Personally, I do not do this for two reasons:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/2xhgchrn8u131.png\n\n1. You have to pay premium to buy the put which decreases the maximum potential profit. The profit margin and return on capital of this trade is already meager, often not exceeding 1%.\n2. If you choose a proper strike far enough below the current stock price the trade should be able to tolerate a significant fall in stock price while remaining profitable (such as if you pick a strike 20% below the current price). While of course \u201crogue waves\u201d happen which do have the potential to completely wipe you out if you are too leveraged; the worse-case scenario is typically that you will be assigned shares that you can then sell covered calls against. Before entering this trade, you should be okay with owning shares of whatever stock you are trading, potentially for the long term until the price recovers.\n\nThere are of course other options similar to this such as short iron condors and the like, which I will not cover here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Short $BYND 7 JUN 75 put at 156&amp;#37; IV allowing for a 27&amp;#37; price drop after earnings and still being fully profitable.](https://i.redd.it/c076hu0z3u131.png)\n\n**Strategy B: Slow Stochastic Swing Trade**\n\nSell at the money (ATM) or near the money cash-secured put 30 to 45 days out when the slow stochastic cross up from oversold territory (&lt;20). This setup occurs infrequently (perhaps 8 to 12 times per year) and is usually preceded by a significant selloff. Back testing yielded 100% success in profitability over the last two years between $QQQ and $SPY. The goal is to capitalize essentially on a \u201cdead cat bounce\u201d in addition to theta decay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Potential long entry points identified by the yellow circles as the slow stochastic crosses up from oversold territory. Note that $SPY is setting up to do this again indicating a possible buy single very soon!](https://i.redd.it/5s7x6j742u131.png)\n\n  \n\n* Strike: within 1 to 2 strikes of ATM (although alternative strikes can be used at your discretion)\n* Expiry: 30 to 45 days\n* Risk: the share price falls lower than the selected strike at expiry and the option is exercised. The acquired shares can be held until the share price recovers, sold immediately for a loss, or held to sell covered calls against.\n\nExit the position once 50%+ profit or if the slow stochastic crosses up into overbought territory (&gt;80) and then back down; whichever occurs first.\n\n**Strategy C1 &amp; C2: 5-Moving Average (MA) Swing Trade**\n\nBuy ATM call when the 5 MA turns upward on the daily chart (or buy ATM put when the 5 MA turns downward on the daily chart) after a run up or run down. Back testing yielded 75% success in profitability over the last two years between $QQQ and $SPY. The goal is to capitalize on a reversal of a sell off.\n\n* Strike: within 1 to 2 strikes of ATM (although alternative strikes can be used)\n* Expiry: 30 to 45 days \n* Risk: the reversal does not hold and the previous momentum resumes resulting in total or near total loss of the option premium paid.\n\nExit the position once 50%+ profit or if the 5 MA resumes its previous direction; whichever occurs first.\n\nC2: Alternatively, you can sell an ATM put 30 to 45 days out when the 5 MA on the daily chart turns upward after a sell off or sell a call 30 to 45 days out when the 5 MA turns down on the daily chart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$SPY potential long entry points identified by yellow circles where the 5 MA goes from a downward trajectory to turning upward. The sharper the fall, usually the stronger the reversal.](https://i.redd.it/eqbsnwjb2u131.png)\n\n  \n\n**Strategy D: Intraday Trading (proprietary)**\n\nFollow [@deafdaytrader](https://twitter.com/deafdaytrader) on Twitter. He is an older deaf gentleman whose writing skills are a bit different. His book \u201cMy Favorite Indicator\u201d is for those who use TD Ameritrade\u2019s thinkorswim and is $10. His strategy can be applied to 5, 15, or 30 minute, hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly charts. I find the success rate is about 50 to 75% depending on how well I actually follow it and the overall market conditions (which suck lately) less the obvious increased risks of day trading weekly options in this volatile market. I don\u2019t employ this strategy too often because of how easy it is to lose money day trading. However, I consider his strategy a real asset. The book paid itself off after a single trade.\n\n[http://deafdaytrader.com/my-favorite-indicator/](http://deafdaytrader.com/my-favorite-indicator/) \n\nRegrettably, he has gone private so he no longer really posts intraday entries and exits but his paid service is only $25 a month although I do not subscribe to it (or any paid service for that matter).\n\n[@option\\_snipper](https://twitter.com/option_snipper) is another good Twitter to follow. He has gone mostly private now and I do not subscribe to his paid service but his previous tweets before he went private were very valuable on technical analysis and day trading such as the importance of the 5-period moving average. There is a myriad of other Fintwit people of varying degrees of usefulness but these two are excellent places to start. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[My thinkorswim layout after following @deafdaytrader.](https://i.redd.it/jys959te2u131.png)\n\n  \n\n**Strategy E: $VIX Intermediate Term Trade**\n\nThe ultra long-term average of the $VIX is near $19.23. However, since 2013 the average is about $14.00. I know it may not seem like it but we are enjoying historically lower volatility over the last several years than before. Think of what the 2008 global financial crisis conditions were compared to conditions today. The $VIX lived above $20.00 back then. \n\nWhen the $VIX spikes above $20.00 it implies that there is more fear in the market than greed. Fear is the time you want to buy assets because everyone is trying to sell them at whatever price they can get which usually means bargain prices below their intrinsic value. Buying assets when the $VIX is below $20.00 is buying when the market is greedy. Prices are going up and if you buy here you are paying top dollar. This is actually the best time to sell.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[$VIX daily chart showing fear vs. greed zones with white dotted line of $19.23, red line one standard deviation above $19.23 \\($27.00\\), and green line one standard deviation below $19.23 \\($11.45\\).](https://i.redd.it/3nle55ug2u131.png)\n\nSince 2013, when the $VIX spikes above $20.00, buying an ATM call six months out yielded an 83% success rate in profitability if you close the position at 50% profit and 73% rate of success if you held to the day of expiry. You need to exercise a bit of caution. When volatility goes up so does IV which makes options more expensive. The strategy holds even if you wait a few days for volatility and IV to calm down before buying in because once the market begins to recover the drop in IV can eat away at the premium value.\n\n* Strike: within 1 to 2 strikes of ATM (although alternative strikes can be used at your discretion)\n* Expiry: 6 months \n* Risk: the markets continue to deteriorate and the $VIX continues to relentlessly climb over the six-month option expiry period resulting in total or near total loss of the option premium paid.\n\nAlternatively, you could also sell ATM options six months out when the $VIX is up to capitalize both on a potential drop in IV and price recovery.\n\n**Note**\n\nMost of these trades require capital to be held on the side. For example, to sell a single $MU option requires about $3,300 to be held as collateral for every put sold. Margin trading eases the amount of cash needed and allows access to about double your cash amount but amplifies profits and more importantly losses by about two times. Additionally, you pay interest to use margin, usually around 9%. The cash in a cash-secured short put does not go anywhere. You can even leave it in a money market fund and it will continue to earn interest while your short put position is open. You just can\u2019t use it to trade.", "created_utc": 1559435499, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bvrnhh/strategies/", "is_self": true}
