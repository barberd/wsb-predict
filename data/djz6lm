Alright I ant posted here before but I\u2019m drunk and I lost money in options so so hear me out. \n\nGod I hate \u201cTHe cASh ApP \u201c.  I\u2019ve never used it but that\u2019s not the point. The name sucks. So fackijg dumb. Nobody has ever said  \u201chey, I\u2019ll pay you with \u201c tHe CASH apP. \u201c it sounds fricking lame. And you can\u2019t say \u201cI\u2019ll pay you with cash\u201d either, because they\u2019re gonna think you\u2019re talking about literal cash. God it\u2019s such a horrible name. Yeah, my name is square and I\u2019m just gonna use CASh as the name of this app cuz I have no fucking creativity. \n\nPeople use VENMO. Not \u201cthe CASh APp\u201d  it will never take off. Yeah, let me Venmo you that. It works. It\u2019s a VERB. Google is a verb. Nobody saw the movie MarsNeeds Moms because the title sucks. You can\u2019t go to the ticket office and say hey, \u201cone ticket for Mars needs moms, please\u201d because it sounds ridiculous. Just kill yourself at that point. \n\nThe point is PYPL been sitting at 100 for too long and it\u2019s time to go up .  Buy calls.
