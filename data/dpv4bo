{"id": "dpv4bo", "title": "Robinhood and margin", "selftext": "Does anyone here know WHY robinhood lets people buy options on margin?\n\nNo broker, td, Schwab,  or any of the other ones I have actually allow you to buy options on margin.  And they are VERY STRICT about tier 4 margin (selling).\n\nI see all these posts of people buying options on margin on robinhood, getting their accounts deep into NEGATIVE balances.  Why do they allow this? They likely will be unable to collect the debt as most of these people have no further assets for them to procure. And why don't they force close the positions as soon as the account dips close to or below 0? Someone please enlighten me. It ends up being robinhood who holds the bag.", "created_utc": 1572560835, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpv4bo/robinhood_and_margin/", "is_self": true}
