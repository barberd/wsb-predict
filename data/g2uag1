He buys 1,000,000 contracts of $SPY 270p on Valentines Day Feb 14th when $SPY is at 337.\n\nWhen buying the contracts his wife urges him not too - as it is all their savings, all the money from the mortgage refinance and the max on all their credit card limits. But he does it anyway. Tells her not to worry and they go out for a V Day dinner.\n\nHe explains the economy can\u2019t possibly withstand the inevitable shutdown. Millions will lose jobs, small businesses will go bankrupt, the cruise and airline industry will need bailouts, a vaccine will take 12-18 months.\n\nIt is now March 23rd and SPY is at 222. The Big V that was put into place on V Day seems like a huge success...\n\nHowever, the main character catches beer flu and slips into a coma. He wakes up to his wife by his side on April 17th with CNBC on the TV... the headline **\u201dUS economy in shambles, 22 million unemployed, terrible earnings, GDP down, small business loans maxed out\u201d**\n\nHe turns to his wife and says \u201cWow! How are my Puts? We must be billionaires!!\u201d\nShe explains to him that SPY is at 285 and that she is leaving him for JPOW.\n\nThe end.", "created_utc": 1587094874.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2uag1/the_big_v/", "is_self": true}
