Selling these two contracts would be $1900, but my account never reflected that. I had very minor other option positions for a total of maybe -$30. I sold halfway down the 1st minor dip shown on the graph at 932am but even the 930am time never shows that I was up by this $1900. What gives? Commission?   \n\n\nThank you in advance for anyone who read through this. \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/zrkrkhnz8wr21.png", "created_utc": 1555101360, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bcii39/1st_time_tendies_but_the_math_doesnt_add_up/", "is_self": true}
