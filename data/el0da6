{"id": "el0da6", "title": "Credit Spreads Are Literally Free Money", "selftext": "So I just recently started trading options, and like most noob retards I just bought calls and puts because everything else was too confusing and hard.  Credit spreads, iron condors, butterflies?  What the fuck does that mean?  Stock going up= Calls, stock going down= Puts.  I thought that was so simple and easy.  Turns out it was simple and easy except my win percentage was like 20%, and I was losing a bunch of money.  I started to get pissed off, but then I realized that if buying calls and puts only won like 20% of the time, then selling them must win 80% of the time.  So I switched strategies and looked into selling calls/puts.  I learned ( I know learning might be too difficult a concept for some of you retards) that selling calls/puts had a much higher probability of success, but also had basically unlimited loss potential if you're wrong.  Now since I'm a huge pussy and don't like unlimited losses, I learned about credit spreads, which not only have a massively high probability of winning, but also cap your losses at a certain amount.  These things literally CAN'T go tits up.  I'm now trading credit spreads and holy shit these things are literally free money.  Like just pick a number you know the stock isn't going to go past and sell that call/put. Then just buy a call/put and little further out of the money, just in case shit goes bad, and you get to keep all that juicy premium you collected when you sold.  FREE FUCKING MONEY.  Check it out.  AMD is a fucking bull train running harder than the train your friend's ran on your sister last night.  No way that shit drops below $47 again.  Sell the $47 put, buy the $45 because I'm a huge pussy and don't like unlimited losses, and the difference premium is all yours when the options expire, mine are 1/10s.  Free fucking money.  This shit is so easy.  I will trade nothing but credit spreads for the rest of my life.", "created_utc": 1578344974, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/el0da6/credit_spreads_are_literally_free_money/", "is_self": true}
