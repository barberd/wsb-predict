{"id": "b31imu", "title": "DD: Uniti Group", "selftext": "TLDR: Long Uniti Calls  $7.50 EXP 08/16/19 and some shares.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong ago WSB used to be a place where you could find autistic ideas to lose money on. I long to return to those days and so here is my contribution to that end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUniti group is a REIT specializing in telecommunications infrastructure, primarily fiber lines.  Recently developments with their largest counter party have driven the stock price down hard. I believe going into 2020 a 50% return is relatively likely, or about a 30% decline.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn brief the story is this. Windstream, a telecommunications provider spun off Uniti years ago and then leased back those assets to actually provide the services they provide.  Some dudes bought up a bunch of Windstream's bonds, said that that spin off broke the debt covenants and thus Windstream was in default. They went to court, Windstream lost and declared bankruptcy (Chapter 11). These final steps played out over the last couple months.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWindstream represents approximately 70% of Uniti's revenue and Uniti represents nearly all of Windstream's infrastructure. One company can not survive without the other currently. When Windstream lost the case and entered bankruptcy proceedings Uniti fell hard. Earlier this month Uniti's accountants basically said, \"if Windstream can't pay for their lease Uniti can't continue as a company for very long.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost people were probably in Uniti for the insane yield.  That is essentially guaranteed gone for this year. Expectations backed by filings indicate a little over a dollar of distributions this year .60 of which has already been paid in January.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, why do I believe in the end this works out for Uniti?:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. The Lease: The lease is pretty strict on what options Windstream has in bankruptcy. They can accept the lease or reject it. This doesn't mean that Uniti can't allow renegotiation of the lease, and that may very well happen. However, they don't have to.  Rejecting the lease outright really isn't an option since Windstream then can not provide services.  As a carrier of last resort and with no other alternative rejection seems highly unlikely so realistically it's going to be accepted or renegotiated.  If it's renegotiated that could be bad for Uniti but acceptance will cause the stock to skyrocket.\n2. No one really wants to see either of these companies fail. Even the debt holder suing Windstream obviously doesn't want them to fold.  The government, debt holders and leadership of the companies all are aligned on keeping these things running in one form or another.\n3. Given Windstream's continued operations they have to use Uniti's infrastructure.  This gives Uniti a pretty good bargaining position.\n4. All Uniti needs to do to return to $15 is maintain status quo and have Windstream's bankruptcy resolved.  Afterwards Windstream will be a stronger counter party and Uniti's cost of capital will likely decrease (a cost that is up substantially this month).\n\nWhat might go wrong?:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Wed the 19th is the conference call for the earnings which were released yesterday (you should read those if you get into this trade.) The company is going to tell everyone they're cutting or suspending the dividend until the end of the year.  Anyone paying attention should already know this but that doesn't mean the market won't react.\n2. If the lease with Windstream is renegotiated at a substantial cut it would dramatically decrease Uniti's ability to pay it's dividend.\n3. If the bankruptcy drags on too long or uncertainty isn't cleared up this year Uniti's cost of capital will remain too high to do anything aside from muddle along waiting for things to change.  Their current plan is to diversify their revenue away from Windstream but that's not feasible with the current share price and the cost they must pay for credit currently.\n\nSo basically I'm long expecting perhaps a short spike (or plummet) later this week depending what they say on the conference call tomorrow and a longer term rise going into later this year.  You can play this via shares, short term with calls (or puts) hoping the conference call garners a favorable (or unfavorable) reaction or longer term with calls towards the end of the year.  I bought in the money calls for August as they seemed pretty cheap in comparison to other options but you do you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll answer questions for awhile if anyone cares. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer: I'm way richer than most of you so the few thousand I'm throwing at this won't make me cry when it goes tits up.
