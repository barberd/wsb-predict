This morning, GOOS is up ~2.5% to around 37.8 so I thought my weak hands would appreciate getting out of this position. \n\nI usually sell half because while I think there is more upside to GOOS, I am a coward. This time, I decided to roll my strike price up by selling my 34.5c's and buying 37.5c's with the same expiry; banking the ~$300 per contract. I now have the same number of contracts, the same expiration, and 'locked in' the $3 rise, correct? The premium difference was pretty negligible (~.04/contract); so I eliminated the risk of losing my profits, but still keep the upside - is there something I'm missing about this action or is this just what every smart person does for an options move?", "created_utc": 1574698375, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e1i6ha/options_question_for_an_idiot_like_me/", "is_self": true}
