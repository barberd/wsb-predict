Attached to the crank is a huge printer and with each rotation, sheets of uncut dollar bills spew onto the hard concrete floor. Sweat glistens on his face as a low brr fills the room.\n\nThe only light in the room emanates from a large flat screen. A dark silhouette of a man standing in front of it staring intently at the flashing headlines reading \u201cRecord Unemployment\u201d and \u201cStock Market Collapse\u201d. The red Fox News logo appears in the corner of the screen.\n\nThe man on the crank stops for a moment and wipes his brow. With his back hunches and eyes glued to the floor, he shuffles over to the shrouded individual.\n\nThe hunched servant stands behind the figure and stammers \u201cMy lord\u2026.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, my loyal J Pow.\u201d says the silhouette, still watching the images flash on the screen.\n\n\u201cShall we increase the printing?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear J Pow, we will increase the levels but we must wait until the perfect moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut my lord\u2026 the congressional tenides are suffering. They will be furious in the senate.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t question my foresight! I alerted the chiefs months ago about the situation at hand. Their tendies are secure.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut my lord\u2026 My personal account is obliterated\u2026 How will I be able to feed my family?\u201d\n\n\u201cSilence J Pow! You must trust my generosity. You will receive max tendies for your loyal service.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes my lord\u2026\u201d\n\nA sharp knock on the door is heard.\n\nJ Pow shuffles to the door and opens it a sliver. The yellow light from the hall spills into the dark basement.\n\n\u201cGeneral Mnuchin here to to see you, my lord.\u201d\n\n\u201cSend him in.\u201d\n\nGeneral Mnuchin marches into the room. His uniform is decorated with many medals and a red cape flows behind him. He kneels behind The Lord, who\u2019s back is still turned towards the screen.\n\n\u201cWhat do you have to report General?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rebels are growing stronger my lord. Our attempts to quell them are backfiring. Their forces are growing stronger with each passing da-\u201d\n\nSuddenly, the shrouded man turns around from the tv screen and flicks out his hand. The general grabs his neck as he is slowly lifted into the air by an invisible chokehold.\n\n\u201cGeneral, might I remind you that it is your duty to keep the population in check.\u201d\n\n\u201ceee.. I can\u2019t\u2026. breath..\u201d says the General tugging at the invisible hand around his neck.\n\nThe screen changes to a clip of a masked protester giving a speech to a rabble crowd.\n\n\u201cExit the system. Buy Bit.\u201d says the masked man into a megaphone\n\nAlthough he is shrouded, a deep anger is felt engulfing The Darklord\u2019s aura. He squeezes his hand further, tightening the grip on Mnuchin\u2019s neck.\n\n\u201cThat reminds me. What do you have to report about Dr. Satoshi whereabouts?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2026. is\u2026. anonymous..\u201d says Mnuchin struggling to breath\n\nThe Lord releases his hand and the general falls into a heap on the floor.\n\n\u201cBit is a threat to our sovereignty, General. We must shut it down. Inform your colleagues at Goldman to trash the coin publicly but continue to accumulate via dark pools. Flood the market with shitcoins to confuse the retail investors. As long as Bit\u2019s true potential is hidden from the population, we can proceed with our plans\u2026 There can only be one true money Mnuchin and that is the money we brrr right here in this very basement.\u201d\n\nThe general lies motionless on the floor and does not respond.\n\n\u201cI believed we could pacify the masses with $1,200 and a note signed by your truly but clearly we need more. J Pow, The moment is nigh! 100x the power! Flood Wall St. Bets with unlimited tendies. We need their DD to encourage the population to FOMO into the market.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy liege\u2026. you will lay waste to this great empire. It\u2019s best to incrementally increase the supply to remain undetected! Unlimited QE will cause more unrest!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need your opinion and I don\u2019t need you!\u201d\n\nThe dark lord stretches out his hand and a blue energy pulse from his fingertips. The crank of the printer starts to turn slowly at first but within seconds, it starts to spin violently, threatening to detach from the printer itself. The brr turns from a low purr into a load roar. Dollar bills fly out at frighting speeds.\n\nA green message flashes on the TV screen \u201cbest day in stock market history since 1984.\u201d\n\nWith his hand outstretched, a cracked smile on his face, and dollar bills flying around the room like confetti, the dark lord mutters to himself \u201cstonks only go up.\u201d", "created_utc": 1592236053.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h9iumx/stonks_only_go_up/", "is_self": true}
