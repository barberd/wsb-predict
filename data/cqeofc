Also why EU will give US a recession.", "selftext": " \n\n**Thought experiment:** if you were a fund manager investing other people's money, would you be buying the dip today, or would you prefer to see how China and Europe reacts to the second worst trading day for SPX this year (also just 9 days after the worst)?\n\nAlso for those who don't get what the fuck is happening - **if Europe gets a recession, you ain't getting away without a recession too**\n\nand the headline today is saying that largest economy in Europe is on the edge, or might already be in a recession. Stimulus packages are now openly demanded from the government by the industry - and it's all over the papers. Any recent mention of Merkel is in the context of the recession - google her name.\n\nThen we have the US market, that couldn't handle 2.5% interest rates. The only reason why we saw SPY300 is the top 10 anime twist of JPow the secret Dove. JPow - the guy who in December was preaching 'auto-pilot' selling and fucking hiked interest rates when business confidence was collapsing together with the SPX level. Bizzare events happened back then - like banks randomly announcing they have sufficient liquidity - it was as if your partner came home and said \"by the way, in case you were wondering, i did not cheat on you\".\n\nAnyway, back to EU's largest economy.\n\n**The EU is China's largest trading partner** \\- guess what the fuck happens to the Chinese economy, weakened by the tariffs, when they lose their largest fucking trade partner? Europe has massive business with China - what does Chinese economy do when this dries up?\n\nGuess who is the largest trading partner for the US.", "created_utc": 1565811369, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cqeofc/why_today_we_will_have_a_mighty_dump_into_the/", "is_self": true}
