The current price of the $95C for 2/21 are all 0.90-0.95, speculating an upside of just 5% from it's current levels. I added to my position today with 20 calls for the above option.\n\nCurrent state of affairs:\n\nStarbucks has been going through management changes over the last year to ensure that both the staff and management teams are properly trained after the racist blunder that occurred last year. Since then, Starbucks has gained a strong reputation for their service. \n\nOn the financial side of things, Starbucks has had a 10% year-over-year growth since 2016. This year, they are set to report -4% revenue compared to last year as a result of the China expansion and headwinds from the geopolitical shit storm between the US/China. Nonetheless, analyst believe that Starbucks will continue to grow as it has owns a large proportion of marketshare in this space with only few serious competitors like LK. Cashflow as of now is in the ballpark of $5B, with about 3B leveraged at the moment. As per the marketcap, they are at \\~107B, with revenues sitting in the 26B range. They are only trading 4 times their revenue which makes this stock relatively affordable for a food/drinks related industry. \n\nI presume that in this coming year, when the second phase of the trade talks are signed (Jan 15), the market will readjust and Starbucks will be aligned for meeting it's high (which currently is about 9% shy of the top). On the options side of things, there is a lot of interest in the $90-100 Call range between 1/17-2/21 expiration. As of today, the short interest volume sits at 635k vs. total volume of 7.3 million (relatively low, but not a cause for concern). \n\nThere is plenty of room to run boys. Let's get out there with some fire plays, buy some of that Starbucks Coffee, and make those fire posts mid January.", "created_utc": 1578597250, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/emed5f/sbux_221_95c_is_a_buy/", "is_self": true}
