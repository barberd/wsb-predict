{"id": "hcecab", "title": "\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b Theory on When Powell will Stop Printing Money Given the Politics of a Job at the FED", "selftext": "There was another redactor who posted about how the corporations become dependent upon the FED's help if it help's to long, and that if the FED stops helping, corporations can be stressed by the debt they took on that is also amplified by reduced spending relative to pre-covid. So if the FED really wanted to hurt the stock market/ economy they could, but also can't given the current administration.\n\nThe reason Powell is printing is because he has no choice, The Federal Reserve Act states that \"*thereafter each member shall hold office for a term of fourteen years from the expiration of the term of his predecessor,*\u00a0***unless sooner removed for cause by the President***\\*.\u201d\\*\n\nPowell probably hates The Big Cheeto. If Powell wants to preserve his job at the fed, his hands are tied because Trump can place the blame on him if the economy mets down, making Powell the cause. Trump is know to fire and scapegoat bureaucratic, and Trump wanted to fire Powell in 2016 for increasing interest rates, which is what you do when unemployment decreases toward 5%. Trump also almost fired our boy JPow  for not printing money, buying junk bonds etc. The firing can be drawn out because of the word \"cause\" in the law, so if the supreme court or congress wanted to draw out the firing they could. They likely would also want  want to use Powell as a scapegoat though, otherwise the Dem's/ court would look like they are in conspiring with the FED to \"destroy America.\"\n\nPowell has to pop the bubble at some point. He cannot print money forever if he wants to control inflation. If he does it to soon, Trump fires him and trump has made it know he wants to fire him.  If there is an economic meltdown around election time however, Trump will not have the time to draw out a firing process of JPow and there will be too much chaos. In the chaos, Powell can ride out the storm in the background. In that specific moment, when debates are happening and the emotions are high, your average person isn't going to care or want to hear about how the FED crashed the economy because it will make no sense to people who don't have some familiarity with the job. Trump will be blamed, and everyone will turn on him. All of this means that Powell could strike a deal with the Dems where his job is secured when they inevitably win, since he made that happen\n\nIf you gay bears where gonna bet on a time the economy crashes, I would by puts/shorts for non tech companies that expire sometime in September/October since the election in is November. I would also do DD on companies that have a low earnings to debt ratio, and short/put those specifically. I can't though because I have no money LMAO, daddy Powell bent me over.\n\n\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b  gang\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: this NY times article is good news for bears.

Altman, [the creator of the Z score](http://people.stern.nyu.edu/ealtman/), a widely used method of predicting business failures, estimated that this year will easily set a record for so-called mega bankruptcies \u2014 filings by companies with $1 billion or more in debt. And he expects the number of merely large bankruptcies \u2014 at least $100 million \u2014 to challenge the record set the year after the 2008 economic crisis.\n\nEven a meaningful rebound in economic activity over the coming months won\u2019t stop it, said Mr. Altman, the Max L. Heine professor of finance, emeritus, at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business. \u201cThe really hurting companies are too far gone to be saved,\u201d he said.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: JPow is gonna backstab Trump soon, stop supporting dead companies, and bankruptcy is coming.", "created_utc": 1592621164.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hcecab/theory_on_when_powell_will_stop_printing_money/", "is_self": true}
