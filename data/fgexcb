{"id": "fgexcb", "title": "Unless we lose the Tech Highflyers, the market should not fall much further.", "selftext": "SO basically your Apple, Msft, Amazon, Google, Mastercard, Adobe, AMD, Netflix and all those other tech stocks that have gone up 50%+ over the past 12 months.\nUnless they have a serious downturn, the market should be fine from here. And right now, nothing is signaling that they are on the verge of a major sell off.\n\nYes Oil stocks are down 50%+, cruise stocks 60%+, Airlines and Hotels down 50%+, cyclical stocks are also down 30% and more.\n\nBut they are all a smaller group of the overall market compared to Technology. This sector moves the market the most.\nSee today: Apple is up 5%, Msft 4,8%, Adobe 4,5%, Amazon 4%. And they stay there. Even though Dow gave back 400 points since the open, they are at session highs. They are the first to bounce after a selloff in the market, and they go down the least if you consider their performance over the last months. \n\nThey barely went down the last 2 weeks, when you factor in, how much they went up. I mean Apple is back where it was just 3 months ago!!!! Same for Microsoft. Netflix is up this year.\nNvidia aswell. Amazon is flat in 2020 so far. Nothing has happened!\n\nThere is just such a massive inflow of capital everytime these stocks pull back just a little bit. Everyone is buying them. Retail, funds, momentum traders, you name it.\n\nUnless this narrative changes, the market will stabilize from here on. Tech is a safe haven trade in this environment right now. The impact of oil and travel stocks to the S&P 500 is limited. And once those stocks have bottomed, the rally back to new highs later in the year together with Tech will be enormous!", "created_utc": 1583851638.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fgexcb/unless_we_lose_the_tech_highflyers_the_market/", "is_self": true}
