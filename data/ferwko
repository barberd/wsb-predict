That gives us a narrow window of roughly 1 MONTH starting with the upcoming bloodiest Monday yet. \nAll of us autistic fucks are raking in tendies, letting the breaded flakes fall through our hands like a medieval whore who can\u2019t carry enough coins in her cum soaked hands. When VIX eventually falls, which nobody can time for sure, it\u2019ll hurt all the premiums. \nThus the three point thesis: \n\n1. PUTS CALLS STRANGLE ME DADDY \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b\ud83d\udc3bthe plays we already are making are good. Continue as usual. SPY 250P, OPK 3P, RCL 50P whatever makes you money boo \ud83e\udd75\n\nMonth passes and we\u2019ve made all the tendies we possibly can\n\n2. BITCOIN HALVING EVENT is occurring 18th of May, 2020. Before being banned, I\u2019d like to point out some interesting points for speculating on anything besides an FD. There are various market factors at play that might incentivize a breakout move. Of course there is the obvious halving of bitcoin rewarded to miners for completing tasks, so incoming supply is halved. Couple that with the below 1% yield on 10 year Bonds, and the boomers and market are going to be scrambling for stores of value to weather out this storm. Boomers will flock to gold, but many others will flock to bitcoin as well. Combine that with the fact that many countries such as France, Germany, South Korea, and India are either reversing bans on crypto or straight up recognizing them as currency \n(The French always surrender \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udf73) \nThis may just create a breakout move where we would see repeats of dec 2018, the newest meme (stock?). \n\nGains made from stonks go into bitcoin both as a store of value and to create insane returns if the market follows this behavior. You want numbers? I AINT GOT EM. THIS IS SPECULATIVE\n\n3. Assuming you have double dipped your massive \ud83c\udf46\ud83c\udf46\ud83c\udf46schlongs in the batter and are ready to fry up, we as an autistic community use the time and energy to bash on enough typewriters to write Shakespeare. Oh yes, the gains made from points 1 and 2 get moved into the climax, much like my wife on her \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udc02. \nCOMING IN THE NEAR FUTURE \n\nSHORTING THE INTERNATIONAL BANKS RELIANT ON EURODOLLARS. This idea is currently receiving mental amounts of traction, and I am genuinely proud of how we\u2019ve come together as a community, collaborating, donating gains, and posting moves for everyone else to maximize tendies. \n\nNow my austistic brethren, be it bull, bear, or even our weird cousins Bi-Stonktual and Thet-Asexuals. I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019d rather become a part of history along with this glorious group. \nPlease discuss thoughts below to see if this is a worthwhile timeline to pursue. I\u2019m 22 and want to make daddy shkreli proud, since I never was here to listen to the lords word in time\n\n\n\nIf we managed, as a collective, to pull this off it would outperform financial funds around the world and would become one of the most legendary moves ever pulled in times of financial crisis. \nMICHAEL BURRY EAT YOUR HEART OUT THIS ONES FOR YOU \n\nTL:DR; PUTS TILL MAY \u2014&gt; BITCOIN YOLO \u2014&gt; INTERNATIONAL BANKS SHORT \n\nPreEdit: I am aware that even discussing B-Coin is violating rule 2, but the events lined up so spectacularly well one after another that I just had to post. \nTo make history you need to sometimes break the rules", "created_utc": 1583566095, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ferwko/the_2020_big_short/", "is_self": true}
