My favorite was this a DD written and this guy calling out OP: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gj1c1n/pcg\\_145c\\_529\\_and\\_19c\\_for\\_september/fqi3pvj/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gj1c1n/pcg_145c_529_and_19c_for_september/fqi3pvj/)\n\nGot in when I saw the virus hitting our shores and stock markets hit ATH's. Had $100k+ in cash laying around but only decided to invest about 30k even though I was sure something big was gonna happen. Turns out it was a once in a lifetime opportunity where I felt certain this is gonna be bad and I didn't make the best of it. Kicking myself for it.\n\nHighest total gain was 300%, since then it's been down consistently with continuous loses and I'm closing out with a 100%+ gain. I did so while doing an insane number of mistakes to start, much money was lost due to stupid beginner mistakes, no diamond hands, sweaty palms, playing dailies,  almost all DD's screwed me, etc..\n\nLately it's been all really bad calls and I'm done losing money. Biggest gains come from all car manufacturers , airlines, banks etc during the start of this. Pic is from Ally, other brokerage is down $20k. Also made about $50k on my 401k (Down from 100k gain at top).\n\nFarewell.\n\nI'll be back next week.", "created_utc": 1589664359.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gl2po3/punching_out_with_gains/", "is_self": true}
