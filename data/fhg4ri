I am thinking that this is just going to be a bunch of spending policies and loans for poorer european countries. Expect this to build the debt bubble and the effects of it to have zero influence on the market.\n\nFinancial markets are predicting the ECB will cut its main deposit rate from minus 0.5 per cent to a new record low of minus 0.6 per cent and possibly even lower. lower interest rates will do little to solve the problems of quarantined consumers not spending and factories not producing. RIP western economies.\n\nTl:DR Puts on Ftse and DAX. We are freefallin'\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Announcment now. CLG of the ECB saying that oil futures are falling, outlook for europe looks poor. Growth in early year unchanged - expect 0 to negative growth for the rest of the year. The monetary policy stance of the ECB is supposed to safeguard corporate lending (for SME's).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNO INTEREST RATE CUTS FOR TODAY!!!!!!!! <-------", "created_utc": 1584018796.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhg4ri/ecb_to_discuss_fiscal_measures_to_fight/", "is_self": true}
