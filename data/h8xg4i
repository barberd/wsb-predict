Though sometimes fully retarded and always highly dysfunctional, it always entertains. \n\nRegardless of what you think this place is, I would even go as far to say that with this pandemic and its collateral issues, WSB has provided a place where many go to escape reality for moment, lose money, and share in a good laugh. \n\nI couple months back, I noticed that there was a common theme that kept popping up in posts and continues to creep into the conversation recently: **charitable giving**. \n\nWhen those sweet Tendies get done printing, many of us are looking for a way to give back. Given the current level of volatility in the markets, we face unprecedented times in which to make (and lose) a fuckton of capital. (I use this term \"fuckton\" loosely as a fuckton to some is $500 and others it may be $500,000.)\n\nAt the same time, given the current social unrest, pandemic issues, and the state of the economy, there are also many ways to give back in meaningful ways and the act of charitable giving will become more relevant the further our society gets fucked with the beer virus.\n\nWithin the last four months, there have been posts like those of u/Minty_Fresh1, that discuss setting up charities and an actual GoFundMe page *Tendies for Tots* set up by u/haupt91 *(which is a fucking awesome name btw)*. There has also been an effort to do some live stream events for charity.\n\nWhat I am not seeing is a *permanent* vehicle for the WSB community's charitable donations.\n\nUp until now, you either see a post like \u201cWhat charity should I give to?\u201d or posts telling autists they should give to charity. This is a good start, but perhaps there is a better way for us to give and to deploy charitable donations as a group, versus sporadically as individuals. \n\n**The solution?**\n\nWe form our own fucking non-profit 501(c)(3) charity. **We call it AUTISTS UNITED. (AU).**\n\n**What do those numbers mean?**\n\nFor the uninitiated\u2026\u2026\n\nA **501**(**c**)(**3**) **organization** is a corporation, trust, unincorporated association, or other type of **organization** exempt from federal income tax under section **501**(**c**)(**3**) of Title 26 of the United States Code. It is one of the 29 types of **501**(**c**) **nonprofit organizations** in the US.\n\n**Purpose of 501(c)(3) organizations and Autists United.**\n\nCongress has long recognized the importance of charitable and philanthropic organizations. Often, these organizations work hand-in-hand with the government serving the needy, revitalizing urban areas, protecting the environment and educating the public. \n\nCertain organizations formed with the public good as their paramount mission can apply for 501 (c)(3) tax-exempt status. This allows them to reinvest the full amount of money it earns and raises since no tax is ever due to the IRS.\n\nIn a nutshell, **AU** will be a non-profit 501 (c)(3) with the mission to invest, grow, and give assets to charities or other societal causes we select for meaningful and lasting impact. \n\nWSB members, instead of giving randomly to charities, donate into **AU** and then recommend and/or vote on how those assets should be invested. **The contributions are tax-deductible to WSB members and the assets in AU grow tax fucking free.** \n\nTHE RESULT: A tax efficient way to give back with charitable funds deployed according to the desire of our merry band of misfits vs. random charitable giving. \n\n**How does Autists United qualify for tax exempt status?**\n\nWhat most clearly distinguishes 501(c)(3) charities from other nonprofits is that donations to 501(c)(3) organizations are tax-deductible to their donors.\n\nTo qualify for tax-exempt status, an organization must be formed and operate for the benefit of the public good. However, a large majority of the organization\u2019s activities must always further a charitable purpose. Any activity engaged in for profit can potentially cause the organization to lose its tax-exempt status. \n\nThere are certain states (think DE, WI, AZ, NV \u2013 leaning to DE formation) that are more favorable for setting up a non-profit, and we would form in one of those states. \n\nTax exempt status is then applied for with the IRS. The IRS has streamlined the application process which would allow us to obtain status much quicker than in previous years. \n\n**What is the advantage of a WSB charity vs. donating to the hundreds of other charities?**\n\n1. **Fucking control**. Right now, you select a charity, send a portion of your Tendies, and just hope that those funds are used according to your wishes. \n\nWith **AU,** we would have full control over how our charitable funds are allocated and to which cause. \n\n2. **Avoid the Bullshit**. Many \"charities\" have alarming issues with how donor funds are ultimately allocated. By establishing our own charity, we eliminate the noise and can ensure that donor funds are properly allocated and deployed to actual charitable causes. \n\nSome charities are awesome, don't get me wrong, but there are some bad fucking apples out there. Without getting into the many pitfalls of donating to many charities, here are a few links:\n\n[https://smartasset.com/mortgage/the-50-worst-charities-in-america-how-to-keep-from-being-scammed](https://smartasset.com/mortgage/the-50-worst-charities-in-america-how-to-keep-from-being-scammed)\n\n[https://medium.com/bestcompany/charity-scandals-the-six-ugliest-of-2016-19d3f1149a]\n\n3. **More focused giving**. By controlling our charitable contributions, we can be more focused on which organizations are most deserving at the time, or even which causes are most applicable depending on the current state of the country. \n\nTo play with this idea further: we could allocate charitable funds directly to communities of our members which many need it the most, or directly to deserving individuals or businesses. In other words, a sniper approach vs. using a shotgun. \n\n4. **Ability to pivot a charitable direction**. Instead of being locked in to one type of charity with your donation where the charitable mission is very niche, **AU** would be positioned to pivot to different charitable causes or specific areas of the country as the need arises.  \n\nI have been involved with private social clubs where this has worked very well. We could select, via voting or some other rational way, 3-4 charitable causes every quarter that we would, *en bloc*, provide contributions, or have member input on a rolling basis as to which causes are most applicable *now*. \n\nThere are other advantages and perks to providing large donations as a group, which I can address at a later time.\n\n**How the do we fund Autists United?**\n\nSame way as any other charity. Tax-exempt entities raise money to fund their activities in many ways. This can include soliciting donations and fundraising events (which WSB has dabbled in the past with live streaming funding of Autism Society of America). \n\nIn short, you give a portion of your Tendies via a donation to **AU**, and you get a tax-write off in return. **AU** can also be funded by stock donations and by it making investments via its own **stock portfolio**. \n\n**What the fuck did you just say about Stonks?**\n\nYes. While completely contrarian to WSB, the AU charity could *hold stonks as assets*. The value and appreciation of those assets can then be used for further charitable giving. \n\nTaking this concept even further----**AU** can hold stock in companies *to which it provides charitable contributions* provided that the contributions comply with IRS guidelines. \n\nIf you think this would be a conflict of interest and super fucked up, look at the Gates Foundation. They have been doing this shit for years. \n\nThe IRS doesn\u2019t treat donations any differently than the profits the organization earns when making investments. As a result, the IRS does not impose income tax when a stock investment pays dividends or when it sells the stock for more than it purchased it for. \n\nAnd since 501(c)(3) organizations can receive donations of stock that are deductible to the donor, the tax savings to the organization are significant when it pays nothing for the stock. \n\nAgain, nothing novel here as most brokerages have vehicles set up for donating stock to charity. However, the difference by donating to the **AU** charity **is that we maintain control over how the charitable funds are used and deployed.** \n\nWe will also be in a much better position to see the impact of our charitable giving as a direct Donor - Recipient relationship is possible. AU would provide ongoing reports of activity and charitable giving to the WSB community. \n\nAny of you had parents who adopted a whale or a star or some shit for you when you were growing up and you got a report on it\u2019s status every month? Like that. \n\n**Can I donate stocks to AU? What if the stonk is a winner?**\n\nGiving appreciated stock you\u2019ve held for more than a year is better than giving cash. If you donate stonk that has increased in value since you bought it more than a year ago \u2013 and if you itemize deductions -- you can take a charitable deduction for the stonk\u2019s fair market value on the day you give it away. \n\nYou\u2019ll also avoid capital-gains taxes on the increase in value over time, which you would have had to pay if you sold the stonk then gave the charity the cash proceeds. \n\nYou can deduct the fair market value only if you hold the stock for more than a year before giving it away. If you\u2019ve held it for less than a year, your deduction is limited to your cost basis -- what you paid for the stonk -- not the current value.\n\nBy donating stonk that has appreciated for more than a year, you are actually giving 20 percent more than if you sold the stonk and then made a cash donation. The reason is simple: avoiding capital gains taxes. The maximum federal capital gains tax rate is 20 percent on long-term holdings. \n\n**What if the stonk is a fucking loser?**\n\nIf it\u2019s a losing stonk, it\u2019s better to sell it and give the cash. If the stonk has lost value, it\u2019s better to sell the stonk first and give the cash to the charity. You\u2019ll still be able to deduct your charitable donation if you itemize, *but you\u2019ll also be able to take a capital loss when you sell the investment*.\n\nIf you are concerned about capital gains in the future, a donation of some appreciated shares and then buying new shares to reset your cost basis at the current, higher price will reduce your future capital gains tax exposure if the stock continues to grow in value. \n\nFor stonk donations, many charities may not be able to easily accept a stonk donation. We will. \n\n**What the fuck is next?** \n\nCorporate formation, bylaws, IRS recognition of exemption for tax exempt status, state tax exemption (if required), and mission and vision statements. Treasury controls and accounting would be handled by reputable third-party firms selected by board of directors.\n\nDomain name is locked in for **AU**, and the toll-free telephone number **1-888-4-TENDIES** is reserved.\n\nI will pay for the legal fees and costs for setting this up using the proceeds I made from selling one of you retarded HTZ calls the day before the delisting news.  \n\n**What can I do to help?**\n\nWe need to set up a board of directors, as the board needs to be named for formation, so any WSB members that wish to be on the Board, just DM me. \n\nIt would be ideal if we have representation on the board from each geographical region in the country for balance, but this is not essential. \n\nWe need at least three members on the board, but the more the merrier, provided it is an odd number. In the DM, **please say a little about yourself and skill set, not just \"I'm in!\"**. \n\nTypically, IRS 501(c)(3) approval takes between 2 and 12 months, inclusive of likely written follow-up questions. Sometimes it takes a little less; sometimes a little more. \n\nThe goal would be to get IRS tax-exempt status ASAP, but before December 31st, so we can realize the charitable deductions on this year\u2019s tax return. (Given the current state of IRS filings and the 10m pieces of unopened mail, this may be impossible, but at least we will be in queue.)\n\n**Who\u2019s in...........?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy positions: long on LUV, LYV, CISCO calls; fucking daily with TVIX with large margin in 30-60 seconds scalps and then not calling her back; going in on AMEX tomorrow.", "created_utc": 1592154180.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h8xg4i/the_convergence_of_retardation_and/", "is_self": true}
