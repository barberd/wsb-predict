Earnings aren't soon, unless I'm missing something, but even short term contracts are super expensive. Is it just because so many people are uncertain about how monetization from Apex Legends is going to go? IMO it doesn't even matter; absolutely nobody bought Anthem, and those who did dropped it so there is no way they're getting any good return on whatever expansions they had in development for it. That's a huge loss, and Apex twitch viewership is already tapering off. (Not that that's direct revenue, but it being above Fortnite for a while was the best advertising it got.)\n\nAnyways I'm rambling. Fuck EA, etc. Is there a big event coming up I'm not aware of?", "created_utc": 1552922606, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b2jzp7/wheres_all_the_iv_on_ea_coming_from_options_are/", "is_self": true}
