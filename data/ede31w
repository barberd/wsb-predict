{"id": "ede31w", "title": "Rev Group is the worst f-ing company on the NYSE. We're bringing DD back.", "selftext": "Rev Group ($REVG) is a fucking joke. They should be trading at HALF of what their current stock price is, at best. I have been following them for years, I've been right about their whole scheme quarter after quarter. I was right about their earnings yesterday and they fucked me. I'm so mad and broke that I sat here all night and typed out most of the DD I have learned over years of analyzing this shithole ~~country~~ company.\n\n**Financials:**\n\n- Let\u2019s start with the numbers. [They're shit.](https://imgur.com/a/AtiOWhf)\n\nRev IPO'd in 2017. They've been losing bottom line every year since they started. This year they actually ran at a loss. [Macrotrends](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/REVG/rev/stock-price-history) is the best visual tool for this, so I\u2019m just going to link you to them and rip off a few of their charts. Keep in mind these don't even include this last 10k. So revisit this in a few days when it's updated because it'll be much worse.\n\n- Profit Margins: [Shit](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/REVG/rev/profit-margins)\n\n- Net Income: [Lol](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/REVG/rev/net-income)\n\nThis company has been losing more and more money, even after selling off one of an under performing subsidiary. Go through that website and see the ratios this company is trading on. Debt to Equity, Price to book, ROI, it's all a fucking joke.\n\nLet\u2019s see what CEO Timmy Sullivan has to say. Spot any patterns you see kids:\n\n- FY 2018 : \u00a0Predicted Net Income = $85 - $100 million. \u00a0 Actual = $13 million. \u00a0\n*\u201cTo say that fiscal 2018 was a challenge would be an understatement, quite frankly anything that could go wrong, did go wrong and then some.\u201d \u201c[W]hile fiscal 2018 was challenging\u2026we have many reasons to believe that we have entered fiscal 2019 poised for improved revenue growth and margins\u201d*\n\n- FY 2019: Predicted Net Income = $43 - $63 million.\u00a0 Actual = \u00a0 (-)$12.3 million (loss).\n*\u201cClearly, 2019 was a difficult and disappointing year, but I am pleased with how we are positioned for 2020.\u201d*\n\n- FY 2020: : Predicted Net Income = $32 - $50 million. Actual = Lol\n\nMost importantly to this whole thing, the stock price has completely diverged from reality.\n\n**Legal:**\n\nSo they have some unique problems which I found in public court documents and no one else seems to have covered. These are all ALLEGATIONS only. They are not even my allegations. I will be linking to and quoting directly from court documents. Rev Group is totally innocent until proven guilty. They are still assholes tho.\n\n- In a case Lemanski v Rev Group (anonfile.com/PfSecbH1n1/Lemanski_V_Rev_Group_pdf) a former employee alleges that he was in a meeting in November 2018 in which *\u201c(Chief Operating Officer) Tom Philips stated Rev Group, Inc. \u2018made up\u2019 the $19,000,000 reported tariff Cost Increase impact\u201d* because *\u201cRev Group, Inc. \u2018needed something to tell the investors\u2019 as a partial reason as to why Rev Group, Inc was not achieving their forecasted performance results\u201d* Lemanski *\u201cintended to report his concerns to the FTC\u201d*. He was then told by a supervisor that *\u201cIf it were me, I would just focus on my commodity and move on\u201d* Rev group then allegedly fucked with his disability leave time and he was allegedly \u201cillegally terminated\u201d. Allegedly. Maybe.\n\u00a0\n- In another case Rev Group is suing their former VP of Bus Sales (anonfile.com/p6T7ceHcn7/Rev_Group_v_Scheuler_pdf) \u00a0Mr. Scheuler, where they allege that he sent an email and resigned immediately. He then got a job at Rev Group\u2019s competitor Forest River in the same position that he was at Rev. They allege that he took his Rev electronic devices with him, and that he *\"downloaded a minimum of 1700 Rev Group Company files\"*. Rev alleges that Mr. Scheuler *\u201cintends to provide this misappropriated information to Forest River to enable them to unlawfully compete in their shared marketplace\u201d*. Rev's bus dealerships are also *\u201cexpressing concerns (that Scheuler) will turn over their confidential information to Forest River.\u201d* Allegedly. Maybe.\n\nDon't forget the MULTIPLE class action lawsuits regarding their IPO claims vs. what a clusterfuck the company has turned out to be. Sign up for [Pacer](https://www.PACER.gov) and see for yourself.\n\n**Employees:**\n\nLet's check [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/REV-Group-Reviews-E1272198.htm) to see what it\u2019s like to work at Rev. I read every review of Rev on Glassdoor, and you should too. I found common themes throughout the years. Basically, everyone is saying that it\u2019s running as well as a monkey fucking a football. They keep saying that management have no idea what they\u2019re doing and don\u2019t listen to the guys on the floor who have actually worked in this field for years. They say that HR is a clusterfuck and fires people all the time for no reason. They are short staffed with constant turn over, and pushing exhausted and undertrained employees to work overtime to try and get shit off the line. They claim that the products are made shitty-ly with shitty parts. They say that the company only cares about stock price.\n\n**Stock Price:**\n\nSpeaking of only caring about stock price, despite their shrinking margins and disaster of a balance sheet, Rev Group has continued to buyback assloads of shares and issue fat diviez, instead of reinvesting that money back into this shit business.\n\n- Since March of 2018, Rev has repurchased around $61,600,000 mm worth of shares. (FY 2018 = $53.3 million @ average of $16.47. FY 2019 = 2019 $8.3 million @ average of $11.62)\n\n- The past 3 fiscal years, they issued over $31,700,000 mm worth of dividends.\n\nThey have issued as much money in dividends alone in the past 3 years as the company has made in net income in the past 3 years. JFC.\n\u00a0\n**Debt:**\n\nThey have a absolute fuckload of debt. They have a loan and a line of credit. They\u2019ve been robbing Peter to pay Paul for years.\n\n- As of this last 10k, they have $175,000,000 mm due on their loan by April, 2022. On October 18, 2019, they amended the Term Loan Agreement to raise the maximum leverage ratio to 4.00 to 1.00 from 3.50 to 1.00. Cause they need more leverage. Oh goody.\n\n- They also owe just under $125,000,000 mm on their credit. And they have an additional $77,000,000 mm of long term debt.\n\u00a0\nSo the company, whose net income for the past 3 years has totaled $32 million dollars (and LOST MONEY this FY) is going to pay off that $175 million dollar loan in the next 2.5 years. Yeah, No. They\u2019re going to have to borrow more money to pay off the money that they borrowed, all while barely turning a profit, if even at all. Rev needs Dave Ramsey\n\n**Ratings:**\n\nDon\u2019t take my word for it, let\u2019s see what [the chucklefucks on Wall Street have to say.](https://trentdailytimes.com/2019/12/19/rev-group-nyserevg-rating-lowered-to-hold-at-valuengine-updated.html)\nDecember 10: ValuEngine cut shares of Rev Group from buy to hold. December 15: Goldman Sachs downgraded REV Group to \u201cSell\u201d. December 16: \u00a0Morgan Stanley Downgrades to \u201cUnderweight\u201d. December 18: Zacks Downgrades Rev to a \u201cSell\u201d.\nThe company has a consensus rating of \"Hold\" and an average target price of $10.44.\n\n**Other Shit:**\n\n54% of Rev shares are owned by American Industrial Partners, AIP. They have them by the balls and are probably the ones playing fucky doody with the share price. They haven't sold any shares since it's IPO. It's in their interest alone that REV keeps paying out money to shareholders via fat divvy's and stonks buybacks, and don't reinvest the money into the business or have any plan to pay their mountain of debt. Members of this investment group reportedly did this fuckery with an industrial mining company they ran into the ground in the early 2000's by just boosting stock value and letting the underlying company implode. Allegedly. Maybe.\n\nThere\u2019s also two blurbs in their 10k which I want to point out:\n\n- *\u201cDuring fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, (Rev) reimbursed its primary equity holder (AIP) for out of pocket expenses in the amount of $1.4 million, $0.9 million and $0.6 million, respectively.\u201d* \u00a0I don\u2019t understand why they reimburse AIP for expenses when they don\u2019t reimburse any other shareholders. Also, what expenses? This is probably 100% normal and cool and I'm just a pleb.\n\n- *\u201cCertain production facilities and offices for two of (REV\u2019s) subsidiaries are ****leased from related parties owned by certain members of management****. Rent expense under these arrangements during fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017 totaled $1.9 million, $1.5 million and $0.3 million, respectively.\u201d* I don\u2019t know what a kickback is. I\u2019m not calling this a kickback. This isn't a kickback. I don\u2019t understand this at all. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s 100% legal and normal.\n\nI\u2019ve look deeply at all their competitors in this space ($WGO, $THO, etc). None of them are even remotely as fucked up as REV, including their debt ratios, share buybacks, actually making fucking money, employment practices, etc.\n\nWith all that in mind. I'm tired. There's more if you go look for yourself. I'll leave you with these words of wisdom:\n\n- *\u201cMy entire career has always been about making money, which in turn directly impacts shareholder value. Revenue is a nice metric, but there are a lot of different ways to make money other than just growing the top line. You should know that at REV, it\u2019s all about making money\u201d* \u2013 CEO Timmy Sullivan\n\nDisclaimer: Everything here is just my opinion, man. Don\u2019t believe a word I say. I\u2019m angry and dumb. My numbers might be off, who knows. Do the fucking research for yourself. Don\u2019t trade on this since fundamentals don\u2019t matter anymore at this fucking company. If anyone wants to rip any of this off an claim it as their own, be my guest. Go post it on a legitimate financial site rather than this haven for gamblers and autists\n\nTL:DR \u2013 Kate Rooney is a smoke show.", "created_utc": 1576867077, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ede31w/rev_group_is_the_worst_fing_company_on_the_nyse/", "is_self": true}
