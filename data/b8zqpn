So if I\u2019m looking to get ACB 5/17 $10 @0.48 and if I buy 1 contract before exportation if I\u2019m up on the call how do I sell for a profit? Do I have to wait for someone to buy my call from me? So should I be looking at the Volume and Open Interest as well when I\u2019m buying a call? I\u2019m worried about trying to sell a few days before expiration and no one buys my option and I lose out. Thanks in advance.
