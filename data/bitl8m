I am a good trader. I am currently up on BP and PFE contracts, I got into AMD at 27.70 so I\u2019m not being burned too bad with that. \n\nI am a good trader. You all doubted me, people made fun of my watch list. They were wrong. If anyone tried to inverse me they should be in the red. \n\nMore watch lists to come. I\u2019ll lay off the gofundme shit so it doesn\u2019t get removed this time lol. \n\nI should start my own stock chat. I honestly think I am that good.
