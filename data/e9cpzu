I would argue if you're too stupid to trade commodities futures, you should do it anyway as long as you post about it here. \n\nWhy?\n\n\\-With market prices so low differential (price o specific qualities vs the market....Colombian Excelso EP10 are at C + 30 cents while Natural brazil grinders are C -20 cents) have gone crazy. No roaster wants to book forward business with high differentials so they bought all the spots they possible could.  \n\n\\-If there are no spots left and no coffee booked for forward delivery....what happens next? Thats right retards they have to buy fucking coffee. \n\n\\-ColDBrew iS 'IN\" SO TheY SEll MooR CofFeEz nOW\n\n\\- Brazil's Currency. lol.\n\n\\-big funds were net short for the last 2 years. Like more than the yearly supply of actual physical coffee short. THIS WEEK we switched from the big guys being net short to net long.  We're guessing the next CFTC report shows them about 2k contracts long...as they like to follow trends (as evidence by how god dam short they were) we expect this to increase overtime up to 40k as they follow the trend.\n\n\\-Analysts have been putting Brazil at a record 65 million bags this year. It looks like it's probably going to be closer to 62 million bags plus there was some odd weather patterns that are going to hurt quality. \n\n\\-Some people are scared of equities and the hard stuff has seen a bump in all sectors...we expect to see this continue.  \n\nWhy should you trust me?\n\n\\- You shouldn't\n\n\\-[Back in July I predicted we'd be up 18% by EOY.
