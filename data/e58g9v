{"id": "e58g9v", "title": "BIIB Discussion for Thursday", "selftext": "This is it. This is the next big mover that can bring our negative accounts to less negative if we call it right. As many of you know the only reason Biogen is trading anywhere near 300 is because they revived their study on an Alzheimer's drug. Before that, they were trading in the 220's as they had scrapped the trials back in March. A LOT of people are skeptical about the results of their studies and A LOT MORE are skeptical that this drug could possibly be passed by the FDA. On Thursday, they will be presenting further data in the studies they have conducted and the results will be pivotal to the stocks short term movement. If the data is extremely promising you can see an upward move of 15-20%, especially if it give signs of potential FDA approval. On the other hand, however, if the data is not great or reaffirms why they had scrapped it back in March, the stock could easily fall back to its prior 220 levels. Just look at the company's charts over the past 5-10 years. It jumps when positive data is released and gets absolutely crushed if it falters. I know everyone would rather jack off mango man and hope for spy tendies but in reality this is the next upcoming money maker. So let's talk about it and give it the all wsb autist try. Although I would wish the data to be positive, it seems unlikely to me, but I'm also wrong a lot.
