In terms of the markets.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n>wHeN inTeRESt rATeS gO doWn, bAnK sAy \u201cI HaVE MonEe \u201d \n\n\n>BaNk gOs tO fEd and ask \u201chOw MuCH iT cosT FoR mOnee?\u201d\n\n\n>Fed say \u201ca sPriNkle UndEr 1.75%\u201d \n\n\n>BaNk say \u201coK tHx\u201d \n\n\n>BoRoweR go tO bAnK anD sAy \u201cI HavE tHiS mUch moneE\u201d\n\nAnd then the bank loans an appropriate amount of money based on the fed funds benchmark rate and the collateral of the borrower. When rates are high borrowing goes down because the cost of money is expensive and the opposite happens when rates are down. \n\nNow this is fine and dandy when the problem has to do with investment in the economy. It works well and GDP posts a positive outlook. However, since the current decline is a result of a virus that is literally shutting down the manufacturing center of the world, there will be more money circulating but there will be not enough raw materials or goods to spend it on. This along with the increase in the money supply in the United States creates what is known as cost-push inflation.\n\nCost-push inflation is when the aggregate supply decreases this stints economic growth and causes consumer prices to rise. This is called a supply shock. \n\nAs firms try to meet stakeholder expectations, they may cut labor in the short-run (because you can\u2019t be as productive with lower available inputs) and unemployment will increase. If this persists (which it likely will, the US economy is already overheated and far below the natural unemployment rate) It results in what is known as stagflation.\n\nDuring a period of stagflation inflation is occurring at the same time as a decrease in buying power. Consumer spending falls off a cliff and STONKS GO DOWN. \n\n\nAnd that\u2019s not even the worst of it. \n\n\nSince interest rates are already so low the USA will be entering uncharted waters by continuing to lower them.\n\nUsually when the eventual rebound of a supply shock occurs the fed can lower the rates and kick start investment again, but if the rates have no where to go but 0 and it comes to that, there will be no incentive for banks to loan funds. AND THEN BOOOM GOES THE FUCKING DYNAMITE. \n\nNew research is conducted to prevent such a calamity from ever happening again, some policy is enacted, and the cycle begins anew. Then STONKS GO UP. But as of right now, the market is fucked.", "created_utc": 1583229034.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcsca0/psa_interest_rate_cuts_and_other_monetary/", "is_self": true}
