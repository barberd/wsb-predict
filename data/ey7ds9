{"id": "ey7ds9", "title": "Signed copies of the WallStreetBets book", "selftext": "By popular request, I figured out a way to sign your paperback copies of the book (for a limited time only).  You may know I fled the contry many years ago and now reside in Mexico, but I decided to take a brief trip back to the US in a couple of weeks to get this done.  So here's how we'll do it:\n\n1.  If you haven't done so already, buy your paperback copy of the book **and ship it to yourself**\n\n2.  Email me at wallstreetbets@gmail.com requesting for signed book copy instructions.  I'll reply with a PO Box to mail your book to and further instructions.\n\n3.  **THE DEADLINE FOR ME TO RECEIVE YOUR BOOK IS FEBRUARY 15** so if you haven't bought a copy and want me to sign one, hurry up and order today.  I don't want your book to stay in my PO Box indefinitely so please please, know the deadline is strict.  \n\nLinks to the books: [kindle](https://www.amazon.com/WallStreetBets-Boomers-Worlds-Biggest-Millennials-ebook/dp/B084CZKCSP/) as well as [paperback](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084DFNN2F/qid=1580486418). Note these links are to the US amazon.  If you live elsewhere, just search for \"wallstreetbets\" in your local market to find the version and avoid region conflicts.  \n\nI'm also doing an AMA to help promote the book, so if you're interested here's the link and vote it up and ask away:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ey7ax7/i_am_im_jaime_rogozinski_author_of_wallstreetbets/\n\n\n***\n\nI also want to say thanks to all the feedback I've gotten.  The reviews on Amazon are hilarious, shit reads like a WSB thread.  But I've received private messages as well as public messages with positive feedback.  Here's a sample:  \n\n\n\n&gt;Read it yesterday. It was a quick read but absolutely gripping. Worth every penny. I loved all the excerpt comments at the end and skipping over describing what FD was. -u/tselatyjr [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ewuvf8/weekend_discussion_thread_january_31_february_2/fg86q98/?context=1)\n\n.\n\n&gt;Props to u/jartek that book is really fucking good man -u/Howtoshortdow\n [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/exv6ne/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_03/fgeqplh/)\n\n.\n\n&gt;only flipped through it a bit so far, but seeing the table from the GUH hall of fame in print format already makes this book a 5/5 for me. -notbitcoin [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ewqu91/wallstreetbets_book_now_available_in_paperback_as/fg7isdf/)\n\n.\n\n&gt;u/jartek\u2019s book is good tho, I particularly liked the refusal to say what FD stands for -u/thicc_dads_club [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/exi1al/wash_rulemark_to_market/fg8arlz/)\n\n.\n\n&gt;Reading u/jartek\u2019s retarded manifesto, it\u2019s actually pretty good. -u/OldTrillionaire [link](u/OldTrillionaire)\n\n.\n\n&gt;Very good. Easily devoured in a few hours. Hope it is a big success for you. -@thechildtrader\n [link](https://twitter.com/thechildtrader/status/1224093481989279747?s=20)", "created_utc": 1580737630, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ey7ds9/signed_copies_of_the_wallstreetbets_book/", "is_self": true}
