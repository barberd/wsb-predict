[https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/fitbit-stock-price-jumps-after-google-agrees-to-buy-company-2019-11-1028651757](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/fitbit-stock-price-jumps-after-google-agrees-to-buy-company-2019-11-1028651757) \n\nNews has been mum for the most part since then, mainly due to the rona and Fitbit's share price has slowly bled down to $6.25 as of this post. \n\nRecently, however, Google has been moving forward with it's plans for the acquisition, having just formally notified the European Commission in writing.[https://ec.europa.eu/competition/mergers/cases/additional\\_data/m9660\\_387\\_3.pdf](https://ec.europa.eu/competition/mergers/cases/additional_data/m9660_387_3.pdf)  \n\nThe plan faces some hurdles. European regulators have until July 20th to decide if they want to block, and various privacy protection groups are raising concerns.  [https://www.euronews.com/2020/06/17/eu-commission-must-block-google-s-acquisition-of-fitbit-says-data-protection-ngo](https://www.euronews.com/2020/06/17/eu-commission-must-block-google-s-acquisition-of-fitbit-says-data-protection-ngo) \n\nAustralia also has concerns:  [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fitbit-m-a-alphabet/google-fitbit-deal-may-hamper-competition-australian-regulator-idUSKBN23P032](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fitbit-m-a-alphabet/google-fitbit-deal-may-hamper-competition-australian-regulator-idUSKBN23P032) \n\nSo if the deal faces so many hurdles, how we gonna make any money if it falls through?\n\nSimple, it's money.\n\n[https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/03/20/google-up-to-94-billion-in-total-fines-to-eu-with-latest-17-billion-adsense-penalty](https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/03/20/google-up-to-94-billion-in-total-fines-to-eu-with-latest-17-billion-adsense-penalty#:~:text=Google%20up%20to%20%249.4%20billion%20in%20total%20fines%20to%20EU,latest%20%241.7%20billion%20AdSense%20penalty&text=The%20European%20Commission%20has%20fined,the%20region%20to%20%249.42%20billion.)\n\nThe EU has already raked in $9.4 billion dollars via fines from Google for various offenses. Between the obvious backhand deals that are gonna take place to grease some palms, and the regulator's chance to smack google with another billion dollar fine or two a year down the road over some perceived data offense, why would they block the chance to rake in free money when there's already a precedent for billion dollar+ fines?\n\nSo let's say the deal goes through and the European Commission doesn't block it. Fitbit is already one of the top 100 owned stocks on Robinhood, meaning once the deal gets approved by the EC everyone with ownership in Fitbit already will immediately see the news. Current stock price has over a dollar it needs to gap up to get back to that $7.35 target, so we have pretty much immediate upside if the acquisition passes the EC on the 20th.\n\nFinally, there's China.\n\n [https://9to5google.com/2020/06/17/smartwatch-market-q1-2020-report-fitbit-wear-os/](https://9to5google.com/2020/06/17/smartwatch-market-q1-2020-report-fitbit-wear-os/) \n\nSmartwatch market grew 12% in Q1, but it wasn't Apple Watches leading the charge, it was Huawei. Fitbit has also under performed year over year as far as market share...whereas Google's Wear OS isn't even in the top 5 smart watches. So, a Chinese company is capturing considerable market share of the wearable Internet of Things marketplace and we're gonna block 2 US companies from merging to create another competitor? \n\nOptions are dirt cheap right now for August. Relatively low volume but again, it's one of the most owned stocks on Robinhood. As we get closer to the 20th, i expect more news to come out that will help drive hype, we may see a bump even leading up to then. Fitbit also releases earnings on July 29th, so there's a secondary earnings play we can make as well on that run-up.\n\nWorst case scenario: The entire deal gets blown up, Google backs out, Autists pile into Fitbit stock like a Hertz rental car and for no discernible reason the stock moons anyway. \n\nTLDR/Positions or Ban:\n\nFIT 8/21 7c, 8c, 9c", "created_utc": 1592493996.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbgqj1/how_are_you_going_to_fit_all_these_tendies_in/", "is_self": true}
