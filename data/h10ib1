A coin. I told myself if it landed tails best out of 7 I would buy and not be a \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b and it hit 4/7. I decided to keep going and it hit 7 in a row. Now I asked my wife\u2019s boyfriend to help me with the math because I don\u2019t understand that shit and he said the chance of that happening was like 1/128 and said that I must be really lucky but that\u2019s bullshit because I\u2019m never lucky so this must be some higher power speaking to me. Go and buy right now boys, I\u2019ve done all the DD you need", "created_utc": 1591886260.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h10ib1/its_time_to_buy_j_pow_spike_to_me_through_my_coin/", "is_self": true}
