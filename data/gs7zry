Even before COVID-19 cruises were notorious for being ocean going pest houses. Google \"Norovirus cruise outbreaks\" for a few hundred examples.\n  \u00a0\nAs a thought experiment, consider NCLH. They just suspended cruises for another month. What happens when that month is up? There are three possibilities:\n  \n1. They begin cruises again. Someone brings the beer flu onboard, either at initial boarding or from a port of call, and the nightmare begins again. Cruising is suspended again across the board, and once the second wave hits, people lose their appetite for it anyway. NCLH and other cruise lines go bankrupt.\n  \u00a0\n2. They delay for another month. And then another month. Eventually the second wave hits. NCLH and other cruise lines go bankrupt.\n  \n3. They begin cruises again. No one brings the Wu-Flu onboard and everything goes according to plan. Karen loses Little Madison's college fund to the slots in the shipboard casino, and asks to see the manager. The cruise industry moons.\n  \n\u00a0\nOne of these things is not like the other, in that it is a simple impossibility. However, the market will continue to moon on cruise lines because of the infinite money retards at the fed and Robinhood trend chasers. Shorting is risky considering the current uptrend. However, long dated puts should cash in at maximum value when these cruise lines go bankrupt. Free money. Literally cannot go tits up.\u00a0", "created_utc": 1590678609.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gs7zry/cruise_industry_is_fukk_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
