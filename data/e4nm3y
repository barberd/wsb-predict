Low Risk High Reward Iron Condor Strategy", "selftext": "Hey there,\n\nSo I\u2019ve read up on Reverse Iron Condors for times when you know a stock is going to move, but just not what direction it\u2019ll move in, like in earnings. I noticed that they are all debit spreads and they usually recommend not going too many strikes out.\n\nMy question is this: Why do people not set reverse Iron Condor credit spreads off earnings several strikes ITM with high payout and low risk? \n\nExample: Stock ABC is trading at $100. It has earnings on a Wednesday and you are expecting it can move either way $6. Why not set a Bull put spread and a bear call spread. Sell the $94 Put and buy the $93 Put and collect around $85 a contract. Then buy the $107 call and sell the $106 Call and collect roughly $85 a contract as well. If you are right about how much it can move then you\u2019ll be largely profitable on one side of your trade and you can try and close out the other without even hitting max loss due to the IV advantage a credit spread brings. \n\nThe only way you\u2019d lose is if it traded between your ceiling and floor, in which case you\u2019d close for a limited loss. \n\nI know early assignment is a risk here, but how big of a risk is it? I\u2019ve done weekly bull put spreads like this before where the stock is trading 10+ strike prices above where I set it at and have never been early assigned. \n\nWhat other flaws are there in this plan, just curious why I haven\u2019t seen people trading this before and want to know how I\u2019d get GUHed if I tried.\n\nThanks guys", "created_utc": 1575233917, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e4nm3y/what_am_i_missing_here_low_risk_high_reward_iron/", "is_self": true}
