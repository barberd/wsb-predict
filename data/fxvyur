Rumors that economy and our daily lives will be just fine after this silly epidemic. Companies will be fine thanks to JPOW's help to last out the shut-in and everyone will get their jobs back and we'll continue as if nothing happened :) OH WAIT. OH NO, Timmy can't get his job back?!

So stock up on your volatility and shorts and be ready for when \"everything is back to normal\" again.", "created_utc": 1586451200.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxvyur/psa_sell_the_news/", "is_self": true}
