{"id": "b4o7pp", "title": "God. Bless. America.", "selftext": "You know why America succeeds every single fucking time? It\u2019s because America was founded on Opportunity, Freedom, and Rights. All these other countries around the world carry thousands of years of baggage, whether it\u2019s monarchies or feudalism or land rights claims. Fuck that shit, that\u2019s why America, time and time again, proves the naysayers wrong and stays #1 forever motherfuckers.\n\nChina, what about them? It\u2019s easy to have fast GDP growth when you start from farming. I don\u2019t worry about China and here\u2019s why: our Lord and Savior Donald J. Trump, the man who slayed the evil witch Hillary and freed us from a tyranny of shit, has done what is necessary to put China in its place. Sure, the tariffs weren\u2019t properly executed, but it\u2019s the thought that counts. Sure, the Syria pullout wasn\u2019t properly executed, but it\u2019s the thought that count. Sure, the tax cuts were apportioned before the midterm elections which they thought would benefit them but backfired as people got smaller refunds this year, but it\u2019s the thought that counts.\n\nAmerica is the land of fucking opportunity, America capitalism at it\u2019s finest. We say No to systemic unfairness and disadvantages. And that\u2019s what makes America great. And most importantly, this is what will make America always great. America is at $19 trillion GDP, our next biggest competitor is China at $12 trillion GDP, about two thirds of America\u2019s GDP. And according to some Bloomberg math tool, if the US grew at its current 2% year over year and China grew at its current 6.5% year over year, the US and China would have equal GDPs at 2029. Are you kidding me, that\u2019s hilarious that even in the most pessimistic view for America and optimistic view for China, it\u2019d STILL take a decade just to equal us. Look at how much America has innovated in the past decade: in 2009 people were buying an iPhone 3GS. \n\nChina suppresses and manipulates the potential of their people. The fundamentals of China are just not there. Like state sponsored currency manipulation and intellectual property theft can only work so much, at a certain point China needs to pivot, and China will never pivot, because it\u2019s now an authoritarian dictatorship run by 1 man Xi Jinping in the Communist Party. So I\u2019m not scared of China, I\u2019m not scared of tariffs, I\u2019m not scared of Trump or SJWs or xenophobia or terrorism or any other boogeyman out there. Because I believe in America, and I believe that anyone saying to look to China to get better returns than the US of A can go ahead and have fun with that, because what China is doing is laughably corrupt and unsustainable. You want to know why all those Chinese billionaires sends their kids to American universities? It\u2019s to study international business. Because they know America is the Land of Opportunity and we are where it\u2019s at.\n\nThank you, and God Bless the United States of America.", "created_utc": 1553374981, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b4o7pp/god_bless_america/", "is_self": true}
