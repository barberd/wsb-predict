The friend I'm staying with told me to come anyway because I always complain about how crowded HK is with people and all the sites and good restaurants are deserted rn so getting around is easy, I think she is right. Worth the risk. Eating all the Michelin starred dim sum with no wait is worth risking coronavirus.\n\nHK time is 14 hours ahead of CST, so 10:30pm to 7:30am trading hours local time, that sucks. I'll sleep through ROKU earnings (it is a steal at under $120 imho, buy that shit up).\n\nWill update if Hong Kong gets included in the flight ban and I get stuck.", "created_utc": 1580661538, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/exr15m/i_decided_to_go_ahead_with_my_hong_kong_trip_this/", "is_self": true}
