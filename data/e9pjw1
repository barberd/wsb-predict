Last night, after I got done beating my dick into submission, that post-nut clarity hit me like Ray Rice after an elevator argument. I remembered back to my glorious days in the sixth grade, when, aside from smoking mid and getting OTPHJs, me and my buddies used to do this vile thing to companies. We would call up the corporate office (say Coke), and say we purchased a defective product recently and would like a refund. After extensive interrogation from the bozo on the other line, they eventually would give up, apologize, and send us a free coupon.\n\nWell, after a few Adderall, King Cobra, and a sleepless night, I finally have developed a master business plan on how to expand on this innocent tomfoolery. Just like our Lord and Savior Jordan Belfort did with penny stocks, we too will steal from the rich and give to the poor. I have written a foolproof script that will get us infinite literal fun coupons from these greedy corporations. The script goes something like this:\n\n\"Hello, I recently purchased a 12 pack of your delicious Coke Zero, and to my surprise, there was a defect.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am so sorry sir, what was wrong with the product?'\n\n\"You see, the outside packaging said I was purchasing Coke Zero, but when I opened the box, it in fact was a 12 pack of regular Coca-Cola. As you know, I've eaten and drank myself into Type 3 Diabetes, so I cannot drink this variation of Coke.\"\n\n\"Oh wow! That is quite the defect. I do apologize for that my good sir. May I ask what the serial number was on that pack of Coke?\"\n\n\"I thought you might ask. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Mike Oxlong, I'm actually on vacation right now, and unfortunately I threw the packaging away. You see, this is the only time each year that I get to get away from my miserable cube and head to Myrtle Beach with my wife who has put on 50 pounds since marriage and my 3 semi-autistic kids. We bought the coke from the local Walmart if that helps\".\n\n\"Alright then. Well I'll tell you what, I'm gonna go ahead and send you a coupon for a free 12 pack of Coke Zero for your troubles, and I do hope  you continue to support our product despite our despicable mistake that we made that seriously inconvenienced you. Have a great day sir.\"\n\nBoom. We got the coupon. Now what? Great question, possible investor. You see, we can do two things once we've acquired the coupons. For one, we can sell them for half the value they are worth. Hey kid, you want a coupon for a 12 pack of coke (retail price of $5.49)? Gimme $2.50 and its yours. That's great and all, but it is not the real revenue potential. That comes from what we r words do best, and that is options. Yessssssss. We're gonna start spreading this bad publicity. Just think about the headlines:\n\n\" Pepsi Co down 20% after 30000 calls reporting lice in their 16 oz bottles\"\n\n\"Who keeps pissing in bags of Doritos?\"\n\n\"Is your kids Capri Sun drugged? These 24586 kids drinks were.\"\n\nShort. Short. Short. Tendies for dayyyyyysssss. I'll work out the logistical shit later, like where are we gonna get all these people to call (thinking pyramid scheme), won't they catch on, is this fraud, yadda yadda. But for now, the dream is real brother.\n\nWho's in?", "created_utc": 1576167040, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e9pjw1/next_wolf_of_wall_street_business_idea_looking/", "is_self": true}
