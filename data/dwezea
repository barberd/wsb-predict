Down from ATH because they changed their pricing model and it fucked with their cash flow - long term this isn\u2019t an issue. Earnings are coming up. \n\n$SLNO - Home run pick. Working on a treatment for PWS, on stage 3 of trials. 90% of patients who did the trials were highly satisfied and are continuing treatment. The drug they are testing(DCCR) is already FDA approved for other conditions, just not for PWS yet. $SLNO is only valued at $70 mil but could be $500 million(at least) once approved. \n\n$SDC killed earnings, revenue growth is 50%, but pissed off orthodontists are making them have to pay quite a bit in legal fees.", "created_utc": 1573761882, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dwezea/stock_picks/", "is_self": true}
