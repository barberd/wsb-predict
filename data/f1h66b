Just pick your gunner class, and there\u2019s a customizable Nerf armament for you. \n\nIs your kid more of an \u201cidealist\u201d?...Nerf AK-47 with extendo banana clip...Kinda more autistic, likes play by himself in the field? They have a fucking .50 cal Nerf Barrett sniper rifle. Throw in some binoculars and a copy of \u201cThings They Carried\u201d with that and Jr. will forget all about the time you gambled away his Space Camp money on SPCE call options. \n\nAnyways, this is one of those toys where if you lose the ammo, you\u2019re fucked and have to buy a new one. Most were under $20-30 bucks, so I don\u2019t think they can come down in price much. \n\nWill be watching Hasbro as a potential coronavirus dip play, and am thinking of other potentially lucrative millennial/zoomer investment opportunities for you all as well...Maybe vape pen penny stocks for when that ban gets lifted.", "created_utc": 1581290829, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f1h66b/calls_on_tgt_has_legit_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
