{"id": "gkc4oy", "title": "State government budget crashes incoming.", "selftext": "MARK YOUR CALENDAR BOYS AND GIRLS OF WSB!!! Most state governments are going to be slashing their budgets across the board at least 15%. So, contract with companies like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon for cloud hosting is probably gonna tank like crazy when all these Universities and State Governments move all of their shit from the cloud to shitty little desktops under their desk. State fiscal years are typically July 1st, so unless a giant bailout for the states are going to happen, I fully expect all the big contracting companies for state governments to see massive reduction from government sources. Earnings reports on the week starting July 13th will reflect this as other companies start to ask banks for lending to mitigate budget shortfalls.
