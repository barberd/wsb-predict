I've been following Scion Asset Management for a while and recently saw that Michael Burry has been averaging down on his now 2.6M share position in the company.  I think its wise to watch successful managers as they usually have a different type of thinking that allows them to choose trades that have positive EV. After doing some basic arithmetic, I deduced that Scion has a basis of around 7.75/share on their 2.6M share position.  Unlike a lot of you guys who go YOLO on 1 week SPY options, I'm more of a 1-5 year investor/swing trader.   \n\n\nAnyways, TLRD has very steady revenue, and not only that, has an improving balance sheet and lastly, the management has guided up around 3 weeks ago, saying that they will have earnings of .78-80 cents per share when they announce earnings on the 11th after market close.  \n\n [https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-Sale-of-corporate-apparel-business-and-higher-Q2-EPS--PR\\_407787](https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-Sale-of-corporate-apparel-business-and-higher-Q2-EPS--PR_407787) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you study their financial statements you'll notice that the revenue per square foot is within 4% of what it was in 2015 when the stock printed 60. The stock is now 6. They pay a dividend of .18 per quarter, and the next ex dividend date is 9/16/19.   \n\n\nInstitutions own 111% of the company due mainly to the fact that over 40% of the shares have been borrowed and sold short. This has the potential for an epic short squeeze.   \n\n\nOver the last week, I've built a pretty sizable position 49,500 shares with an average purchase price of 5.40.  \n\nMy thoughts are that I won't sell unless this triples at least, or is bought out (very possible here as this is so incredibly cheap), or goes bankrupt. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCouple of things to head off the naysayers:   \n\n\n\\#1) the risk that Amazon or another online seller is going to crush Tailored Brand's is extremely small. The issue is that Amazon can't sell tailored suits. It can sell ill-fitting suits just fine, but not properly fitting ones. Guys don't know crap about measuring so competition from a site like [IndoChino.com](https://IndoChino.com) is limited.  I personally have bought maybe 40 shirts and 3 suits from indochino, but it took me quite a while to get my measurements dialed in. Wasn't easy.  Yes I know that MensWearhouse stuff isn't the highest quality, but they walk you through it and you look pretty good when they are done. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#2 The risk of the movement towards business casual (non suits) at work. We have not seen a significant decrease in per square foot sales at all, at most 4%, which is way way less than the 90% stock punishment since 2015. Lastly TLRD provides insurance against a recession. In a recessions, people lose their jobs, and then people dust off their resume, go get a new suit so they look good for the interview and shop themselves out until they find a new job.   \n\n\nLastly people may say: who will buy this at 15-20 a share? Well TLRD has a trailing 12 month earnings of 1.51 per morningstar and is going to make .78-.80 per share for the most recent quarter. I'd propose that there are plenty of people willing to pay 10x and a .72 cent dividend. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm ready to get flamed, so flame on!", "created_utc": 1568073898, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d1ziyw/tlrd_i_purchased_01_stake_in_the_company/", "is_self": true}
