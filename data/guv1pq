{"id": "guv1pq", "title": "ORCL Earnings Play", "selftext": "Intro:\n\nOracle makes enterprise software (database management system) for UNIX, LINUX and Windows Operating Systems. They have acquired Acme Packet (produces and markets session border controllers, multiservice security gateways and session routing proxies), BEA Systems (specializes in enterprise infrastructure software products), Hyperion Corp. (Financial Management System that provides financial consolidation and reporting that enables you to rapidly consolidate and report financial results), MICRO Systems (designs and engineers processor-based control systems, unmanned vehicle control stations, and flight terminal systems), NetSuite (cloud ERP enterprise that provides SaaS to manage to manage business finances, operations and customer relations), PeopleSoft (ERP that provides human resource management systems, financial management solutions, supply chain management solutions and enterprise performance solutions), Siebel Systems (CRM engaged in design, development, marketing, and support) and Sun MicroSystems (sells computers, computer components, and IT services - also the creator of Java). Essentially, they are one of the biggest leaders of Cloud.\n\nCOVID has further increased the demand and need of Cloud and has accelerated the integration of Cloud-based companies. As such, ORCL is expected to achieve higher levels of growth.\n\nKey Highlights:\n\n\\- ORCL's next quarterly ER: **June 17, 2020**\n\n\\- ORCL stock has recovered from the crash relatively quickly and has shown a pretty strong support of $51 and resistance of \\~$54. Current stock price $53.06 (with a moderate down-trend).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1t1qaasigd251.png?width=1213&format=png&auto=webp&s=f60e1d579092fd1cf1c9208a44e5e63c12b1b0eb\n\n\\- The highest EPS forecast recorded in ORCL's history for the upcoming ER (1.2 vs 0.96 of last quarter - pre-covid)\n\n\\- Multiple revenue streams while showing steady growth\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u66dsrdumd251.png?width=831&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9d6a0e957db2322fdfb45c4b6d0331d70768f9f\n\n\\- Many fear the next S&P500 slide is soon coming as we're nearing its pre-covid number, but SPY vs ORCL correlation index is 0.44 so rest assured, ORCL will not be impacted as much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p5asbgoymd251.png?width=1337&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca88c90da438a9dafc667e4b010820e84d8d4414\n\n\\- Low IV  (soon to increase) and the recent drop signals a great entry point.\n\nPotential:\n\nMost cloud companies' stock price surged pre and post ER breaking its ATH. Comparatively, ORCL will be at least $58 leading up to ER.\n\nORCL 55c 06/26", "created_utc": 1591051991.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/guv1pq/orcl_earnings_play/", "is_self": true}
