{"id": "fdo2cc", "title": "I JUST WENT ALL IN ON WEED STOCKS!!!", "selftext": "Context: 19 y/o turned 5k-9.3k CAD on $CGC holding a postition from 2017-2019. When the position was worth 39k CAD (CGC Hit $59 USD) it was in my moms RRSP (Canadian IRA) and she didnt want a 17 y/o at the time having 40k so she said i couldnt sell it. In october she gave me my investment which was worth $10k CAD. I spent the last 4-5 months tryna dollar cost avg my way down on aurora and canopy. I just sold my Canopy $CGC position and went balls deep in $ACB. Call me fucking retarded or autistic but i think a reverse stock split followed by a equity partnership for cash will give aurora the rally it needs until the cannabis 2.0 revenue and 20+ store openings in Ontario (Canada's most populous province) which currently has just over 25 stores compared to the nearly 600 Colorado has. I beleive these Step's will be enough to save the company and rally the stock to some new 52 week if not ath's within the next 1-4 years. Aka a whole lotta tendies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCheers,\n\nWSB\\_Autist420\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6msv6yijkrk41.png?width=989&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bb3838499b52e05fbdb07ecdeb82ceb40891dec", "created_utc": 1583374120.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fdo2cc/i_just_went_all_in_on_weed_stocks/", "is_self": true}
