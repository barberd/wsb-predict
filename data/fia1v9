Hey, I got fucked during the crash too....we have every right to be upset.\n\nDo they have all the features and bells and whistles of platforms like TOS?  No, but their interface is clean, straightforward, easy to use, and significantly faster than any other mobile app.  And honestly, it just runs smoother ans loads faster going in and out of equities, etc.  After the crash I tried em all....Webull, TOS (settled here now), TDA, Etrade, and Fidelity.  May have tried Schwab too, not sure.\n\nI honestly miss the UI as a retarded millenial pleb, but in all honesty what I miss most....is the instant transfer.  Yes, other platforms have it if u wanna be \ud83c\udf08 and buy stonks, but RH was the king for options....you could instantly throw away as much money as you wanted (up to the limit) by initiating a deposit.\n\nNo fucking FOMO waiting 4-5 business days waiting on funds to settle for options trading.  No missing out on gambling your last paycheck when someone makes a shallow and thoughtless DD post an hour before the market opens.  You can lose as much as you like, whenever you like, so long as you can trick RH into believing that the deposit is gonna clear.  \n\nINSTANT.  FUCKING.  2D TENDIE PRINTING.\n\nKnawmean?", "created_utc": 1584146326.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fia1v9/probably_gonna_catch_downvotes_for_this_but_i/", "is_self": true}
