Etsy is a niche market with a strong brand. This makes them a very attractive target for acquisition. Etsy has also been consistently profitable, though there were some margin and revenue contractions in the past. Q4 typically has always been good to Etsy. \n\n**Technical**: Priced above 50D MA, below 20 and 200D MA.  MACD shows bullish convergence. RSI shows around 50, coming up from neutral. Options sentiments are bearish in volume and bullish open interest, with 45P and 60C being the 2 most traded strikes. Implied movement of 14.7% or 7.50$.\n\n**Sentimental**: Given the online niche marketplace that Etsy resides in, seasonal gains are normal. EPS improvements are none, but revenue is slated to grow 30%+ YoY, which is a benchmark for growth companies in general. Guidance was sandbagged and this quarter may see a repeat performance in both top and bottom line beats.  **The new 12% fee will also give management a means to spike guidance, which is the primary bull case for this earnings. While there have been backlash and talks of leaving the platform, the niche market Etsy operates  in will be a great moat to force compliance.** \n\n**ROI : 23%**\n\n**Risk Level - 4 of 5, Very Risky**\n\n**Iron Condor should be 45$ and 60$ with a 2$ width. \\*\\* This is more advanced and will require management.** \n\n[Robinhood SS](https://imgur.com/a/SS8AkcM)", "created_utc": 1582745151, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9ym7u/etsy_etsy_2262020_amc_capitalism_soul/", "is_self": true}
