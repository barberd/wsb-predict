After listening to u/Variation-Separate and others on the Twitch stream yesterday, I was inspired to break out my crayon box and see if I could summon the powers of Ms Cleo by drawing some straight lines on a chart.  \n\nAs a basis for my artwork I thumbed through my dusty old copy of \u2018Elliott Wave Principal\u2019 by Frost and Prechter (2005 version) to see if there was any insights on pull backs (ups?) during a bear run. I came across this graph of a correction during the crash of \u201973 and thought it looked vaguely familiar to the correction occurring now. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s6bpdhuwefp41.jpg?width=1911&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6f411ead5639ddcd8ab891c882945ee874da50a7\n\nI decided to cross reference the percent moves against what\u2019s happening now to see if I could draw any parallels and I was actually a bit surprised at the results. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/es865891ffp41.png?width=918&format=png&auto=webp&s=67d360b3444d626cadaee5d67d4433ddab5fa1ce\n\nThis matrix compares the corrective movement in the DJIA to the corrective movement occurring now in SPY. While 1973 didn\u2019t have as deep of an initial drop, I\u2019m only interested in the corrective movement ratios which so far has been aligning pretty fuckin close (yellow text is projected as it hasn\u2019t been confirmed yet). \n\nIf we are expecting similar price action to the 1973 corrective movement, I\u2019d say we are in the zone right before the peak labeled \u201cC\u201d on the 1973 chart with sideways movement before a pop and drop. I\u2019d say another test of 264 is possible on Monday or Tuesday, otherwise this bitch takes a dump over some days/weeks to 202. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nero7dy8ffp41.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=01cbc49a82968b5440e1091d8f59fc0e53953531\n\n  \n\nNow don\u2019t take this as gospel, I\u2019m just some idiot with access to a box of crayons and knowledge of the percent change formula. Its just another thing you might consider when refining your positions for the next leg down that so many have predicted.\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with Elliott Wave theory, in a nutshell, it\u2019s a principal developed by a partnership between Nostradamus, Ms Cleo, and some dude named Elliot in the 1930s that says the stock market moves in repeatable and identifiable patterns that align with Fibonacci ratios and some hocus pocus counting shit. People have been using it in TA ever since, but problem is 5 different people could come up with 5 different counts as its easy to get lost in the noise. This seems like a bit more obvious of a setup tho, but then again I\u2019m just an idiot with a crayon.   Yeah were not in 1973, yeah the market dynamics and time frame are different, but Elliott wave is about the ratios and movements being repeatable and identifiable, not fundamentals so dont @ me with that shit.\n\nSPY 4/17 238p\n\nSPY 5/15 201p\n\nVIX 4/15 65C (I have no idea how tf to play VIX, this seems conservative for a short term hold to vega hedge or whatever, honestly tho I got in my positions at what I think is a decent volatility so this is just to double fuck myself if I\u2019m wrong)\n\nDont ask me about inflation, gold prices, oil, dark pool, gama hedging or any of the other big brain shit other people have been including in their DD, im too stupid for that.", "created_utc": 1585407877.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqlt2w/parallels_between_this_weeks_corrective_price/", "is_self": true}
