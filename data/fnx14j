{"id": "fnx14j", "title": "Quad Witching Part 2", "selftext": "So many of you incels keep bringing up how awful the unemployment numbers are going to be Thursday because you all bought puts at the bottom right before a brief rally, as is tradition here at WSB.  EVERYONE KNOWS THAT THE NUMBERS WILL BE REALLY BAD RETARDS.  Its fucking priced in.  Every god damn business is closed, and no one knows when they can open back up.  Barely anyone has a fucking job right now.  The report is not going to crash SPY so you can unload the stupid position you took.  And the senate is not trying to delay the stimulus for Thursday to offset the report.  They're just fucking politicians that always put themselves first and like to put on a big production. \n\nThe SPY RSI is at fucking 20 on the weekly.  It is WAY oversold.  We still have further down to go, but its not going to be all in one freefall.  A face ripper is coming this week or next, then back down we go.  But this fucking unemployment report is going to dick so many of you down, just like Friday did, so put your rouge on and spread them cheeks for Daddy Powell.", "created_utc": 1585016167.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnx14j/quad_witching_part_2/", "is_self": true}
