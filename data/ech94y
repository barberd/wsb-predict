I don't want the wiretaps so have been dumping them.  Last year, was able to sell just below MSRP via college classifieds without too much difficulty.  This year: NO BITES AT ALL.  May end up giving away to a friend.\n\nMy highly-tuned theory is that everyone either:\n\n1. Bought them early-ish\n2. Doesn't want one (too creepy probably?)\n3. Got them FOR FREE from Papa Jeff or the Goog\n\nI assume these products don't wear out very easily, since they're just sitting there inertly without moving parts.  Is this market almost saturated?\n\nPlease take my anecdote and lose some money with it, idk", "created_utc": 1576697235, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ech94y/smart_speaker_market_collapse_incoming/", "is_self": true}
