{"id": "fcmvfq", "title": "Willful Negligence.", "selftext": "Christine Hall:\u00a0The main benefits that we see in going self-clearing is taking clearing, settlement and custody in-house. There will be three major impacts that our customers see.\n\nThe first is in fees. Although we\u2019re already zero-commission, we are removing or lowering fees even more. There were about seven fees passed on from our old clearing broker-dealer. Even though those fees only affected a minority of the customers on our platform, they were painful when users did experience them.\n\nAn example\u2014if you had a recurring ACH setup and put a few dollars into your Robinhood account every week, and one week your bank account is short, and you overdraft and have to go through an ACH reversal process, we previously charged $30 for that. It\u2019s an industry standard, but when we integrated directly with a bank and started doing the ACH processing ourselves, we read the fine print and the bank was only billing us nine dollars for ACH reversals, which is significantly lower than what users get charged. So we cut the fee to nine dollars.\n\nThe second is that now that we have more direct insight into customers\u2019 accounts from the street side, we can offer more support and troubleshooting with a unified picture of the customer\u2019s account. \u2713\n\nThe last way that this impacts customers is that it\u2019ll over a better overall experience. Previously, things like proxy voting notices weren\u2019t written in plain language and were delivered at suboptimal times. They didn\u2019t look like they were coming from Robinhood. These critical customer notices have been brought in-house and are written well in advance of events like tax day.", "created_utc": 1583198951, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcmvfq/willful_negligence/", "is_self": true}
