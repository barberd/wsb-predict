They're pushing their opening back by two more weeks because apparently people will forget that CV-19 was even here and fill the theaters the day they open.\n\nBy the way...why are studios pushing movie releases back, ONLY to release them to streaming services two weeks later? Restaurants still aren't back 100%, states are rolling back reopenings...but somehow AMC will magically live?\n\nCan they just let it go so my p00ts print?\n\nTLDR; AMC is dead and fighting harder than my dog that got hit by a car in 5th grade. Time to go girl.\n\n$AMC 2.50P 7/10", "created_utc": 1593521069.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/himnkt/how_is_amc_still_alive/", "is_self": true}
