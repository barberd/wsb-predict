PTON looks good and I bet their orders are through the roof! Who can pay for it, who could pay for a Tesla, rich white people thats who. I would know, all my dumbass friends own one and will not shut the fuck up about it.\n\nPTON calls on the selloff this evening, MRNA calls anytime here. I'm also biting into CRWD BA and SNAP cause they look good, and flipped my MSFT 182.5 C into a 185 C and cash. Roll out ya shit boyssss\n\nalso ROKU can go crazy but I'd buy spreads, that shit is EXPENSIVE.\n\nedit: hey look, it started selling off. Might be more profit taking before close.", "created_utc": 1588785787.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/geob61/mrna_and_pton_earnings_before_market_open_tomorrow/", "is_self": true}
