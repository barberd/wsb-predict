Inventory Numbers", "selftext": "Alright autists heres my DD I made up during my 2am adderoll fueled, drunken stumble home from the bar this weekend. \n\nSo I did a quick search in Google, and am now a recession expert. I know for fact that the most important metrics in predicting a recession is unemployment, inflation and (here's the kicker) **manufacturing numbers.** \n\nManufacturing numbers have been trash in the latter half of 2019, but legit this means nothing as these companies can legit just make whatever the fuck they want. Plus like who gives a shit about economic numbers anyway, clearly not the market. \n\nThats why the key to this whole operation is, you guessed it **INVENTORY**. As reporting season is upon us, take a look at the balance sheet and take a look at year over year inventory. If I see this number propped up you can bet your ass I plan on losing another 20k on UVXY calls and SPY puts. \n\nInventory too high, manufacturing goes down further. Manufacturing goes down, unemployment goes up.  Fuck inflation I dont even know what that means.", "created_utc": 1579555011, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/erju2n/the_key_to_timing_the_top_of_the_market_inventory/", "is_self": true}
