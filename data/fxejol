This run-up is totally NORMAL in a bull market and since our \"recession-savior\" JPOW injected shit ton of cash, market is doing just that. Lower volume, steady increase.

Relax, stop FD'ing and pick up some VXX (volatility play) for end of April.", "created_utc": 1586378887.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxejol/psa_pre_earnings_run_up/", "is_self": true}
