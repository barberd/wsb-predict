Additionally, the central banks across the world are announcing their support in \"calming the markets\" IE, we'll inject some money and prevent an all out crash in the future. \n\nSo in my view, short of an all out insane pandemic in the US, the central banks will prevent extreme swings, gradually nearer to the .1-1% normal days, reducing volatility, increasing the value of an INVERSE VIX ETF. And thats my plan. Long the fuck out of an inverse VIX ETF.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFree money or am I an idiot?
