Those are the same tech savvy pool of people that will get prime. Prime yr is about 120.00. If we estimate 5 mil sign up for prime (low figure) that is 1.25 per share earning. \n\nIBM reported 18% rev growth on cloud. I most often forget IBM has cloud services. \n\nSHOP is having crazy e-commerce success. Amazon already had to hire shit load of people. \n\nSo...
