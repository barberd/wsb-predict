{"id": "f957zd", "title": "&lt;Insert Company Name Here&gt; will announce an acquisition of Crowdstrike $CRWD", "selftext": "After this sub peaking with the DD on $LL I figured I would do my part.  Yes it's a throw away account if you can't figure out why then you didn't read to the end and you can't be helped.\n\nAs the title says it is my believe that the purchase of Crowdstrike is imminent for a few reason. \n\nFirst RSA Con is this week. With all of the major players and competitors, and customers, paying attention it is the perfect time to make this announcement.  CrowdStrike's investor briefing is at 8:45 PT.  Although this probably isn't where the fireworks are.  There is an interesting Keynote at 11:55 PT.  \n\nNext Dmitri Alperovitch, CTO and co-founder, has left the company \"to launch a nonprofit\".  That's one way of looking at it.  Another is that he knows he's getting ready to cash out.\n\nAnd lastly and most importantly in my mind.  If a large player in the sector was testing software and features that were consistent with seamless integration of Crowdstrike's products into an existing platform, that player would make the testers sign NDA's.  On a completely unrelated note there is this weird thing with NDA's where sometimes you can't say you're under an NDA or who it's with. \n\nIf I were a betting man, I'd be acquiring more CRWD stock than I already have and leveraging capital for calls.  Oh wait, I'm on WSB so yea, I'm a betting man.", "created_utc": 1582607867, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f957zd/insert_company_name_here_will_announce_an/", "is_self": true}
