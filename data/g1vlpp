ESports betting is exploding in popularity and people are even gambling on (and watching) [Madden simulations](https://www.oddsshark.com/esports/sim-sports/madden-20-odds).  I thought I had seen peak degeneracy playing in underground NYC poker rooms and reading what you dirtbags post on this sub but betting on computer sport simulations takes the cake (then again, it's not that much more fake than this market). No one knows when live sports will come back now that Disney put their mouse cock on the table and forced Dana White to [cancel UFC 249](https://www.kxl.com/disney-steps-in-forces-dana-white-to-cancel-ufc-249/). And despite what Daddy Trump may tell you in his thus far incredibly successful attempts at feeding his leftover viagra to the stock market, it's looking like the only sweaty grunting dudes you're going to be seeing for the time being are in your bedroom.\n\nThrough the fog of godawful Big Bang Theory reruns and exciting free Pornhub premium, a hero emerges.  As u/killlthenoise posted [earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0zfh0/wwe_was_deemed_an_essential_business_by_florida/), another fine demonstration of how this country functions took place Monday the WWE was granted essential business status in the state of Florida while, rather coincidentally, [Linda McMahon spearheads](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/19/linda-mcmahon-2020-america-first-trump-super-pac-1368075) one of the largest Trump super-PACs out there. I\u2019m not here to bitch about the transparent shadiness here (tons of subreddits out there for that), I\u2019m just trying to make some money so my cat isn\u2019t seized by ETrade during a margin call. The WWE isn\u2019t sports per se but it will scratch an itch that many people have as long as that itch isn't related to chlamydia.  Fans, even the casual ones, will watch because barely anyone's releasing new content even tangentially related to live sports unless you're a fan of Nicuraguan soccer or Russian ping pong (these are legit the last two live sports my book has listed).  Degens will watch because while mine doesn't, some sportsbooks are starting to take bets on WWE matches, especially since spoilers will be tough to come by with just a skeleton crew working these events. People are starved for some kind of live-ish entertainment and with no competition, it\u2019s a once in a lifetime opportunity for them to attract some new eyeballs.\n\nThe WWE Network hasn't been the runaway success they expected when they launched it a few years ago but they're making 265 million dollars a year from NBC for airing Raw, 205 million per year from Fox for Smackdown and, incredibly, 50 million per year from Saudi Arabia for hosting a few shows there.  Revenues are pretty much locked in besides gate which isn't a major part of their business model,  competition is as low as it'll ever be and costs are plummeting.  [From today](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2886744-wwe-announces-future-roster-cuts-executive-pay-cuts-amid-covid-19-pandemic): \"The Company's reductions of employee compensation and headcount result in an estimated monthly savings of $4 million along with cash flow improvement of $140 million primarily from the deferral in spending on the Company's new headquarters.\"\n\nLet's touch on a few possible downsides.  [The XFL folded last week](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/xfl-shuts-down-no-plans-return-2021-1289777) which is a shame because they were actually making some good strides this year and made gambling on games easier than ever (RIP  NY Renegades, we hardly knew ya).  The XFL is run by a separate company than WWE so it shouldn't affect the company.  The overlap is just the founder and apparently Vinny Mac was prepared to take a [375 million dollar loss](https://fanbuzz.com/xfl/vince-mcmahon-xfl-investment/) in the first three years of the league.  Losses will still be painful for year one, possibly even worse than the ones you're experiencing on your John Holmes-esque portfolio of SPY puts, but not as bad as they would have been had the league been planning for year two right now, and that's not even considering the possibility they had insurance to the tits [like Wimbledon did](https://www.liveinsurancenews.com/wimbledons-pandemic-insurance-will-pay-141-million-for-cancellation/8549427/) (they basically bought puts on themselves; wish there was a way for me to do that).  Vinny offloading 15% of his stock a month ago initially concerned me but on closer inspection he did the [same in 2018](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2809196-vince-mcmahon-sells-around-23m-in-wwe-stock-around-1-of-stake-in-company) when they were opening the XFL to free up some cash for his other venture; odds are he was doing the same here after they closed up shop.  I have heard the possibility raised that they filed for bankruptcy so they could get some of that sweet freshly printed government money.  Also doesn't hurt that Vince got a [sweetheart deal](https://deadline.com/2020/03/vince-mcmahon-sell-15-wwe-stock-1202892214/) to sell his stock, because of course he did, but he kinda still owns it now.\n\nWhile most stocks have rebounded huge during this latest face-ripping rally, WWE stock is still trading around 1/3 of it's price a year ago when it was $99.25, and much of that drop was due to a [January shakeup](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-30/wwe-plunges-after-earnings-slump-and-company-sacks-management) that saw them replace some of their top execs.  I could go into technicals on the company and the stock but I know most of you are just skipping down to the bottom for a strike anyways so fuck it, let's make some cash...just make sure you declare it all so [Irwyn R. Schyster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNCy9_DU8I4) doesn't come looking for you.\n\nTL;DR - WWE 5/15 40c\n\nAnd to our heroes at the SEC, if you're reading this - I have no idea what the hell I'm doing.", "created_utc": 1586969055.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1vlpp/if_you_smellllllll_what_vince_is_cooking_wwe_calls/", "is_self": true}
