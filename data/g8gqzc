Don\u2019t plan on holding either for more than a couple days. I feel like MSFT is the safer bet, but I think AAPL has some really good news up their sleeve. They\u2019re reportedly increasing stock buyback\u2014 investors love that shit. Last earnings showed significant growth in services (Apple Pay/Apple Card, Apple TV+, Apple Music, App Store, Apple Arcade). No doubt will this segment grow more. New release of a $399 iPhone that\u2019s faster than a lot of flagship Androids is surely to be a huge hit. Obviously, I\u2019m more biased towards Apple.
