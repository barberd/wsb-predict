Buy before it\u2019s too late.", "selftext": "I\u2019m not great at DDs but ima give this a shot. \n\nHoneywell is a massive All-American, high margin, government contract loving cash cow. \n\nThey took a huge dip for beervirus and the correction is looming. They dont just do air conditioners. See aerospace, massive solar farms, high efficiency refineries, safety PPE, manufacturing plants, chemicals provider, build buildings, and cater to retail. \n\nThey have massive government contracts, even more massive private contracts, and a general trust with the public when it comes to retail products. \n\n10.41 BILLION cash on hand\n\n36.7B in profits in 2019, admittedly a decline, but with a 17% profit margin they are doing fine if you check out their income chart they are actually in an upswing and I\u2019m expecting a 20% YoY increase in net profits for April earnings. \n\nSolid PE of 19.84\n&amp; a decent dividend to keep the stock stable. \n\nThis company is American made and should not have been this affected by coronavirus. \n\n\nThe call premium is also extremely cheap and you can pick up $200 calls for Apr17 for 0.16 a piece right now, tho I\u2019d go closer to the money to avoid leap break but I honestly see this company above $200 by April. \n\nTo be fair:\nI have long $HON options positions.", "created_utc": 1583346061, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fdh7yl/the_case_for_honeywell_hon_buy_before_its_too_late/", "is_self": true}
