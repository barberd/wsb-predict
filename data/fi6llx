Grab your nuts my autistic friends cuz we're going down the hole.\n\nHello, fellow members of this illustrious community, I've been lurking in the shadows for some time til I thought it proper to come to the light. Look, when it comes to finance I am nearly as retarded as your average /all visitor, but I follow politics and stuff, and I think this will be a useful bit of insight for you US rednecks.\n\nI live in Spain. Among paellas, siestas and fiestas, my country usually scores absurdly well in healthcare rankings. The state's got your back for pretty much everything, usually for free. Public hospitals everywhere. Very good doctors. And even so the coronavirus is spreading like a rabid dog trying to eat that burger chunk that fell out of your picnic table.\n\nAs of today, all nonesential commercial activity has been shut down in major cities. We have state emergency declared and orders have been issued to forbid free movement unless justified. And so far, it has not been enough to avoid it from spreading. In only the last 24 hours, the number of cases have increased in 50%. That's fucking nuts, let me tell you. My friends working in hospitals, from doctor to nurse to administrator, have all said that they are preparing like this was WWIII. It is expected that our system will be massively flooded, if it doesn't downright collapse that is.\n\nWhen the first measures started to be taken, we had very few cases. Some tourists in an island resort, a couple of weirdos in the capital. Now it is everywhere. And it is expected, even at the institutional level, that it will get way worse in the coming days.\n\nAnyways, haven't come here to cry, but to warn. The actions taken by the US government to fight it are, in my view, a hot pile of smelly garbage. The test system that he proposed is going to take days to yield results if you use that google page. And that grocery shopping and coronavirus testing sounds very weird to my European baby ass. Work and economic activity continue almost as usual. For fuck's sake, we are talking about \"hundreths of thousands of tests\" for a population of 330.000.000 people.\n\nThis is it, take your own conclussions and do what you want, I personally putting my minimal wage money on those sweet SP500 puts, that baby is gonna take the direct route to index hell in the coming weeks.\n\nPeace bros.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1584132683.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fi6llx/my_country_ranks_highly_in_healthcare_systems/", "is_self": true}
