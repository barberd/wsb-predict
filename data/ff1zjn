Anything that is oil field service related (Think NOV, HAL, schlumberger, baker hughes etc) is going to get absolutely eviscerated and here is why.\n\n2006-2014 oil and natty gas was high all these companies had sloppy high capex. 2015/2016 commodity crash. Revenues tanked but operating expenditures collapsed as well. Larger players took out debt and cut operating costs to survived. 2nd half 2017 through all 2018 there was a boom and major capex came back online gearing up for the moon. \n\nTarriffs and shit kicked in, commodity prices fell, revenues dropped but this time operational costs did not fall this time. This placed tremendous pressure on the servicing companies.\n\nLate 2019-2020. Complete collapsing of commodity prices, operational costs haven\u2019t fallen to compensate, and the debt markets aren\u2019t willing to come in like in 2016 for the larger players.\n\nI usually post retarded meme shit but this is gospel I\u2019m laying out today. If it is oil field servicing you will absolutely see the most bankruptcies you\u2019ve ever seen this year. \n\nTLDR: Short any and all oil field servicing companies to your hearts desire they are going to bleed all year long.", "created_utc": 1583616993, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ff1zjn/heres_some_actual_dd_for_you_idiots/", "is_self": true}
