{"id": "cyhfhu", "title": "I track YOLOs so you don't have to - August 2019 (+ new fundamental analysis added to the site)", "selftext": "For those of you that aren't familiar with the site I created, it's at:\n\n[SwaggyStonks](https://www.swaggystocks.com)\n\nIt contains a WSB 'Sentiment' analyzer, Due Diligence tracker, and a YOLO tracker.\n\n# Quick \"How it works\"\n\nI log positions of posts flagged as \"YOLO/Gains/Losses\" and post them to my site. For actual options YOLO plays it will automatically keep track the current value of the play and the win/loss percent. Every position on the site links back to it's appropriate thread on WallStreetBets so you can take a look and read the comments/juicy details as well! All other gains, losses, and expired YOLOs are placed in the \"Expired YOLOs\" section.\n\nNew Section! I've added a new section of \"Top YOLOs\". Here you can go through the TOP YOLOs of All Time (TYOAT) and view the YOLOs by: most upvotes, biggest gains, biggest losses.\n\nPlease note I do my best to keep track of them all and sometimes the OP of the YOLO disappears in which case I let the YOLO ride until expiry. It's fun to see what they could be worth!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Recent additions to the site:**\n\n\\* As per last month's post. I've finally pushed the updates that include viewing some nice stock financial charts and fundamental analysis. Here's a short breakdown of the new features I've added. If you want a full summary on them, I made a post in r/StockMarket that has a lot more info! The post can be found here\n\n[Fundamental Analysis Post - Reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/cvtrpc/i_created_a_stock_market_site_that_visually/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**New Features**\n\n**1)** A new \"Stocks\" section where you can search stocks outside of the WallStreetBets sentiment. In this section you can search for tickers to do your own fundamental analysis. The stock page contains the following data:\n\n**1-A)** Short-term stock chart, fundamental data, key stats, and recent news.\n\n**1-B)** Stock Financials: For you fake autists you can finally view your favorite stock financials data in nicely organized charts (w/ pretty colors). Here you can quickly scan fundamental financial data to get a quick understanding of how your stock is operating. Personally, I find the charts on the \"Fundamental Data\" section the most helpful, but if you want to dive into all the financial statements that's cool too. For you REAL autists who love crunching numbers switch between \"Chart-Mode\" and \"Textify\" to read those beautiful numbers.\n\n**1-C)** Historical Earnings: Wanting to do an EARNINGS YOLO? View how your stock has reacted in the past to previous earnings report and take a gamble where the next one will go. A good example of this is AAPL who's stock price has declined on earnings only 1 time! (literal WOW).\n\n**2)** Earnings Calendar: MY earnings calendar isn't as pretty as \"Earnings Whisperer's\" calendar, but I feel it provides a bit more data to see who is reporting that day. Scroll below the calendar and you'll be able to see all recent earnings reports and stock price reactions to those reports. The calendar only displays stocks greater than 45-50B in MARKET CAP, but there is a button at the top to display ALL upcoming earnings in list-view.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Future Updates** (Here's what I am currently working on for the site and should be ready in the next week or two):\n\nI am currently working on adding an \"Options Analyzer\" tool. The tool will work by scanning day-old options data (maybe 3-4 days old for smaller cap stocks less than 5B) and log it to my database. It will be similar to Barchart's \"Option\" analyzer tool (mine is also FREE), but I wanted to focus on less of an options screener/filter and more on improving how you can compare the prices on purchasing/selling an option. For example, the tool can be used mainly in the following ways:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1)** View the historical yield for an option of a specific expiration date throughout the entire life of the option. (IE: You view the call option chains for AAPL on September 6, 2019. You will be able to view an estimation of what the options were yielding (say, at 5% OTM) from inception to current date and see how the option price changed with reporting earnings or other market fluctuations/news.\n\n**2)** Filter through a list options of highest premiums and lowest premiums. Use this tool to see where you might want to sell a covered call or a spread and collect premium vs outright buying the option instead. This tool will be great as a guideline rather than an indicator (IE: you see JNUG is at the top of the list providing 10% premium on 2-week options doesn't necessarily mean it's the best option to collect premium on. However, if you've been following AAPL and you see it's reached a high of $220 you can then see how much premium you might be able to collect by selling a call spread or covered call.)\n\n**3)** Option Yields Comparisons: Say you've been following 3 stocks: DIS, AAPL, AMZN. You think all 3 stocks have been hit very hard in the short term due to some Trump tweets, so you think it could be a great time to collect some premium by selling PUTS on the stock. The Yields-Comparison tool will be able to show you what each of the 3 stocks are currently offering in terms of yields and help you with your decision.\n\n\\*The options tool will also tell you specifically which options include an upcoming earnings, which would become more of a gamble at that point, so you can avoid accidentally purchasing options that are more expensive due to earnings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Here are some notable YOLOs/Gains/Losses from the month of August\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**HONORABLE MENTIONS**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AnalyFarmer2's Journey**\n\n1) [$180k play with ALGN](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ckapu5/algn_play_180k_profit_in_5_minutes/)\n\n2) [$277k in one minute with SPY Puts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cksrsf/spy_puts_277k_profit_in_1_minute/)\n\n3) [$600k SPY YOLO ($500k LOSS)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ckycr2/600k_yolo_in_fds_expiring_tmrw_if_i_die_remember/)\n\n4) [Final YOLO into CGC calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/co31pq/my_final_yolo_40k_into_cgc_calls_expiring_next/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe **individual stocks** that provided WSB members with the **biggest GainZ** this month were:\n\nTarget -TGT\n\nActivision - ATVI\n\nFastly - FSLY\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Most Insane Active YOLOs:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n$170k in CRWD calls - u/IAmABlubFish\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Biggest Gains:**\n\n$782k - [u/jimbeam145](https://www.reddit.com/user/jimbeam145/) (SHOP)\n\n$277k - [u/analfarmer2](https://www.reddit.com/user/analfarmer2/) (SPY)\n\n$180k - [u/analfarmer2](https://www.reddit.com/user/analfarmer2/) (ALGN)\n\n$170k - [u/Yocz23](https://www.reddit.com/user/Yocz23/) (ULTA PUTS)\n\n$160k - [u/Fuyuki\\_Wataru](https://www.reddit.com/user/Fuyuki_Wataru/) (BYND)\n\n$137k - [u/Warbring3r](https://www.reddit.com/user/Warbring3r/) (PINS)\n\n$125k - [u/MoveGEtoWallSt](https://www.reddit.com/user/MoveGEtoWallSt/) (AMZN)\n\n$95k - [u/MBA2016](https://www.reddit.com/user/MBA2016/) (NUGT)\n\n$77k - [u/one\\_roll](https://www.reddit.com/user/one_roll/) (NUGT)\n\n$70k - [u/hskdbaldbeiam](https://www.reddit.com/user/hskdbaldbeiam/) (SPY PUTS)\n\n$61k - [u/BlueberryShakes](https://www.reddit.com/user/BlueberryShakes/) (AMZN)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Biggest Losses:**\n\n\\-$500k - [u/analfarmer2](https://www.reddit.com/user/analfarmer2/) (SPY)\n\n-$46k - [u/oversold1234](https://www.reddit.com/user/oversold1234/) (TEVA)\n\n\\-$45k - [u/EngHH](https://www.reddit.com/user/EngHH/)\n\n-$39k - [u/jxzheng951](https://www.reddit.com/user/jxzheng951/)\n\n-$36k - [u/bluffff](https://www.reddit.com/user/bluffff/) (AMD)\n\n-$32k - [u/hnnnnggggggg](https://www.reddit.com/user/hnnnnggggggg/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone has any feature recommendations, comments, or concerns post here!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGodspeed bois", "created_utc": 1567381774, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cyhfhu/i_track_yolos_so_you_dont_have_to_august_2019_new/", "is_self": true}
