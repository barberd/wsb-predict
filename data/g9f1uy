Not really looking into the DD.\n\nAlso most will assume because American is in the name that they are an American shipping company. They are not a Jones act shipper.\n\nNAT is still a solid play and will bring the tendiez. Just sharing these links and info. \n\nJones act ships: KMI, OSG, ASCJF\n\nAlready seeing some after hours movement on OSG. Shares are sitting at $2.62. \n\n$2.5 calls are pretty much free right now.  Back in 2016 (last contango) shares were around $10-11\n\n*I\u2019m holding NAT, TNK, STNG and EURN. Just wanted to share these links an info for consideration too. Will probably load up on some 5/15 and 6/19 OSG $2.5C tomorrow because why not. *", "created_utc": 1588041782.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9f1uy/tankers_jones_act_ships_next/", "is_self": true}
