And why didn't they put in more money to become even richer or is OP just that poor?\n\nTo answer all those questions, first, you must look into WSB's past. Many of you know the legends of the $NVDA puts guy, the $ROKU puts guy, or u/__Fog. All of them had one thing in common, weapons grade autism and making small fortunes using FDs. I sought to recreate their success over the last few months by undergoing similar conditions, i.e. very little money and a terrible brokerage like Robinhood. \n\nNow why did I subject myself to this?\n\nAs u/ipa-warrior much more eloquently puts an observation I made several months ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fa08kj/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_27_2020/fiwgmow/\n\n&gt;I cracked the code on something over the past few months. I noticed that whenever I throw say, 25%+ of my account into one dumb trade, I tend to lose my ass. Comparatively, when I make a relatively small trade, 5%-10% of my portfolio, I'll often close up 50-300%. I would then scream at the monitor as to why I didn't make a \"big play\" when I win.  \n\nAnd they are absolutely right. Hypothetically, I could have YOLO'd everything and be a multi-millionaire right now, but realistically and truthfully, there is no way I could have done the same thing with everything I have. My emotions would become a very restricting factor. I might panic sell seeing my account lose tens of thousands of dollars in minutes, I might sell too early, or I might just straight up ruin my life clinging to a position. With much smaller amounts that really are nothing to me, I could rid myself of these negative factors and potentially achieve peak WSB autism. \n\nThus leads to my current theory and why I achieved such bigly % gains: \n\nThe more inconsequential your deposit amount is, the more restrictive your positions are, and the shittier the brokerage you're using (Robinhood violated Regulation T, got fined for front running customers, and can't even get a 1099 right), the more likely you can FD your way to some bigly gains. \n\nExhibit A- My 1-year graph RH graph to display my observation period losing money to FDs attempting to recreate that success: https://imgur.com/Ruf45UU\n\nFirst spike: Tesla puts April to May 2019 (Didn't go far enough OTM)\n\nSecond spike: Roku puts, September 2019 (Didn't reinvest my bigly gains into more ROKU puts, which would have outdone the legendary ROKU puts guy). \n\nDecline between second spike and now: FDs on a multiple stocks. Not hits. Kept deposing less and less money trying to mirror positions in TD (apparently didn't work with the less money I had, classic gambler's fallacy)\n\nThird spike (now): Looking for the frothiest stock valuations to buy OTM puts on for quick profits, especially valuation bubbles which will be the biggest winners for sure. \n\nThank you for coming to my TED Talks. \n\nTLDR; Autism + FD = More Tendies", "created_utc": 1582866232, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fapj52/i_turned_9690_into_187k_in_the_last_6_trading/", "is_self": true}
