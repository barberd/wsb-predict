Hey, it's me again, I still don't know how to do TA or FA, the last post I made here was shorting a company that went up after I made my post. But a broken clock's right twice a day, so without further ado, EA calls look good. They get a lot of their revenue from games-as-a-service(read shitty MTX) but they recently released SW: The Fallen Order. It's pretty sweet, it did well on MetaCritic, and the numbers they got for PC sales were good, and the NPD Video Games Sales rankings come out Thursday night that should be a positive catalyst. This game doing well also means $DIS will probably get them to develop more SW games, which print money. Could get fucked by orange man, a lower-ranking than expected on NPD, the lack of baby Yoda in SW: TFO or other stuff, but I don't think they will.", "created_utc": 1575923443, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e8fjf5/jedi_mind_trick/", "is_self": true}
