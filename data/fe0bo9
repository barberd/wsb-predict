I read everything in the universe on spanish flu and the disease ur mom gave me. restaurants and events go down... double digit losses. \n\n2.) have you been to a Wingstop or Shake Shack? they are dressed up shitty food. how are they going to justify trading at 80x earnings when no one is eating there\n\n3.) restaurant workers don\u2019t have healthcare  and need to work. all it will take is someone getting corona at a shake shack whatever just like the cruise ship off the coast of SF now\n\n4.) these are in nice areas (malls or downtown biz) with richer people. And guess what the rich people aren\u2019t going to work and the rich people can afford to buy nice food and shit from Costco and Whole Foods or whatever and wait this thing out at home. Poor people like you guys can\u2019t and will keep going to Taco Bell.", "created_utc": 1583435665, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fe0bo9/fake_fancy_restaurants_are_going_to_die_shak_wing/", "is_self": true}
