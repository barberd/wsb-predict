Sorry so late I'm sure you'll find something to put calls on. \n(CHFS), continues to pay off well.\n(IEP), tho more expensive at $65.72 It shows up on my radar.\n(SMSI), $6.18 I'll be filled with tendies.\n\nPouring Glenlevit on ice....\n\n(SPCE), who doesn't have battlestar galactica.\n(SAND), This one popped up the other day did not here about it here.\n(LK), looks good, pouring another glass...\n(UXIN), there were tendies laying on the floor so I picked em up. Wait that might have been me on the floor.\n(IBN), yes it's a bank I think. I forgot.\n(NVTA), @ $22.99 there might be tendies left in this one. \nAnd the last three are solid. Literally can't go tits up. V, MA, and WM, that's my list do with it what you want. \n\nFor safety reasons I will tell you don't take financial advice from a guy laying on the floor drinking no matter how old the label says it is.\n\nSee you tomorrow.", "created_utc": 1581300711, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f1jcdm/weekend_stock_picks/", "is_self": true}
