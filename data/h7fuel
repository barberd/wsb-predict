{"id": "h7fuel", "title": "How To Play Responsibly", "selftext": "There's a lot of idiots running around here, watching a 5 minute video on options and then immediately downloading the RH app. \n\nWe're living in unprecedented times right now.. Things might get real ugly soon. I wanted to offer a few tips to some of you who might not have the stomach for the losses or gains that may occur. \n\nDo whatever you want, do not take this as official advice in any capacity, and I am not responsible for any decisions you make based off this information.\n\n*ANYWAY*\n\nHere's my Guide To ~~Gambling~~ Investing:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **Practice good bankroll management.** \n\nHow much are you willing to lose? If you speak to someone who has their shit together, this can also be phrased: **understand your risk tolerance.** I don't know a lot about options, but in poker you should typically have between 10-20 \"buyins\" at the stakes you're playing. Simply put, this means investing *no more than 10% of your stimulus check into the stonks.* Unless you're following a strategy you've explicitly set (see: (3)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. **Do Things Besides Gambling**\n\nThe markets are open a lot. Are you hyper-focused on the market? Reading news 24-7? Browsing Reddit for more astrology to convince you what strike to buy puts at for your wife's boyfriend?\n\nGet a hobby. When you have positions cleaned up- and you're all cash- look away from the market. Go outside, exercise. Do something else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  3. **Follow a strategy**\n\nWhen you enter a trade or gamble, you should have an exit strategy. **If you continually bet on red/black, you will be wrong eventually.** Is it +100%? -50%? Will you roll your calls over to a later date? Figure this out *BEFORE* you're leveraged to the tits and sinking. If your plan is to have \"diamond hands\", figure that out before you're in. There aren't many weird outcomes here. Stonk goes up, down, or sideways. Figure out your strategy and stick to it. because if your mind is in the wrong place, you could end up doing something particularly stupid. So,...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. **Play for the right reasons**\n\nWhy are you doing this? Are you hedging a larger portfolio? Are you trying to win a scratch-off lottery-ticket 10-bagger scenario and buy a lambo? Do you hate money and want to stimulate the economy  by dumping your entire retirement account into some PE firms deposit box? Are you trying to get unstuck from a previous loss?\n\nIf you feel bad about the reason why you're doing this, again- go to (2) and probably do something else. It's one thing to laugh at some reddit posts and click the up arrow, but losing lots of money could potentially have consequences. Make sure you're happy with why you're playing. And finally,...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n 5. **Know when to walk away**\n\nIf you're consistently losing, you should consider the fact that additional gambling may make things worse and not better. Just because you've read stories of people tripling up and restoring their account balances, doesn't mean it will happen to you.\n\nFor every idiot who posts an enormous win, there are hundreds who cry themselves to sleep over their blood-red accounts. Two rules here:\n\n\\- Don't chase a loss. *(i.e doubling down on a bet to get unstuck)*\n\n\\- Remember why you're playing *(see: (4)). If your reasons have changed, maybe stop.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n6. **Have fun + Keep Perspective.**\n\nI can't believe this shit is legal for individual investors with absolutely no knowledge of markets. For some reason, I can't play poker online for $100, but I'm allowed to put $100k into a Robinhood account and start speculating on the direction of the market without having taken any kind of test to show my competence. Have fun out there and score some tendies.\n\nBut remember: money is money. Don't do anything you'll regret over a loss. There are people who care about you. Folks are around to talk if you're upset. There's a whole community of idiots here available for chatting. For more official help,...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n7. **Know your resources.**\n\nGambling Help Line:  [https://www.ncpgambling.org/help-treatment/national-helpline-1-800-522-4700/](https://www.ncpgambling.org/help-treatment/national-helpline-1-800-522-4700/) \n\nNational Suicide Prevention Hotline:  1-800-273-8255 \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*tl;dr: SPY $280p 7/1*", "created_utc": 1591945190.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h7fuel/how_to_play_responsibly/", "is_self": true}
