Im aware this is ambitious but still plausible.  Its a scalp not neccesarily a buy and hold.  My SPY Calls doubled but my AMD calls went down 5% im quite confused as to why this happend.  Would the server garbage have something to do with this?  Like theyre on RH and since im guessing not as much got traded or something?  \n\nI dont know why it would be decay since theres literally a full month before expiration, but AMD went up almost 5% and theyre down 5% am I missing something or will they go up on open tommorrow?
