How much more can the stock be pumped?\n\n**OPPORTUNITIES for this stock to go to the moon this year.**\n\n* Re-opening ticket sales.  Thousands have expressed an interest in buying a 250k ticket.  If they re-open sales and many thousands pay then this will give them solid income over the next few years to invest in  space point-to-point travel.\n* Richard Branson flies on the first full spaceflight and steps out alive.  Watching this live-streamed all over the internet will have potentially millions watching. Just like the Red Bull guy that jumped out of an air balloon.\n* Full commercial space tourist flights start to become routine.  After Branson on the first flight we could then see routine flights go up with a full compliment of paying passengers. \n\n**RISKS for this stock to crash all over the desert.**\n\n* Earnings report in Feb is worse than markets expect and they don't re-open ticket sales.\n* Richard Branson dies on the first flight. \n* Richard Branson dies at anytime in the next 12 months.\n* Routine space flights don't happen. Branson has for the last 10 years said that flights were \"only 6 months away\"\n\nIf all the opportunities are met then this stock could break the ozone layer and go to Mars.\n\nIf one of the risks happen then the Bear Gang will win.", "created_utc": 1579712545, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eset1m/opportunities_and_risks_for_spce_over_the_next_12/", "is_self": true}
