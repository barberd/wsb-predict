{"id": "gm48ln", "title": "Large Mall Stocks are skyrocketing today with no event impact and zero news. Jump in before the big \"V\" shaped recovery swing in the next couple weeks. DD", "selftext": "**UPDATE:** Went to a $MAC mall \"tysons corner\" and there are lines for the shoe stores that seem to have 15-30 people in them, as well as a small line at the 711. \n\n\\------\n\nI had made a thread about the top major mall stocks before, and people decided that despite them being among the first shopping outlet/strips to open as states recover, and having important property deals, including government contracts, that they would have slow growth, if any, and that people would be to \"scurred\"  to go to major malls.\n\nMultiple images and videos of lines at malls later, as well as pent up demand, we now see today malls not only surprising opening high at pre-market but souring throughout the day, even now.\n\n***Current rate as of this post:***\n\n**$MAC:** Up 12% and climbing.\n\n**$REG**: up 12% and climbing\n\n**$KIM:** Up 12% and counting\n\n**$SPG:** Up 10% and climbing.\n\n**$PEI:** Up 9% and climbing.\n\n**$SKT**: up 7% and climbing.\n\nThese are the big boys jumping up right now setting up for the big recovery.\n\nAs i predicted, the set-up for the big swing is coming and there is now a short window to jump in or you'll be forced to jump through the FOMO gates. **Here are some upcoming events that will be happening within the next few days to couple weeks and why you should jump on malls now:**\n\n1. SPG's taubman buyout still happening.\n2. MAC and REG are on the way to have more government tenants move in.\n3. Part of PEI's loans will be forgiven\n4. Tanger helped several of it's clients get forgivable and SBA loans and have now gotten more of their rent paid as well as some rent ahead of time.\n5. PEi, and Tanger are in the middle of acquisitions and partnerships on new projects that will be funded.\n6. MAC and SPG lawsuit against city that cancelled contract project is pretty much a victory just waiting for the gavel.\n7. (rumor) Pent up demand has sales reaching holiday levels in consumerism for SPG, MAC, and Tanger, **scattered press announcements from all 3 about mall performance (numbers and sales) expected from all 3 across the next couple weeks, which will correlate with rising stock prices.**\n8. Mac and Pei have managed to operate effectively with reduced overhead that they realized they didn't need until the virus struck, which has greatly reduced operating expenses that used to bleed money for both (more so mac).\n9. Rumored whole foods partnership and Amazon store partnerships to open new WF/Amazon retail in malls owned by MAC and REG, including delivery and distribution centers.\n\nSPG is still a wild card, it'll swing back, but I don't know if it will be consistent until we hit June because it swings all over the place, while the other malls are stable. So if you bet on exp before June you may end up in a good or bad position so I'd just take that in June, the others seem to be following similar consistent patterns so a may exp will likely be safer with them.\n\nI expect most of these to Swing back to at or close to their pre-sars2 highs by the first week of June, and possibly higher after that as the news of mall performance trickles out.\n\nNow how long the recovery will last is the only question. I think that up until September is guarantee, and only with any return of Sars2/corona after late sept do I think the malls may be screwed again. IF not, than I expect the malls to hold up for the rest of the year until after the holiday season, where in January they will correct back to their pre-covid stay at home declines again.\n\nSo the malls will be making money for several months so this is the time to jump in, DD.", "created_utc": 1589817847.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gm48ln/large_mall_stocks_are_skyrocketing_today_with_no/", "is_self": true}
