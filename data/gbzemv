I have seen this for a over 2 years already, people psot their gains in equivalents of the car model they are going to buy.\n Musk is on here and he knows this, so anytime he wants to increase sales he simply gives Tendies for WSB'ers holding TSLA puts which they then use to buy cybertrucks.\n\nWhen the stock goes back up WSB Call holders buy tesla cars. \n\n#all musk has to do is keep the volatility going. It is like a VIX straddle that never expires and pays him dividends.\n\nDaddy Elon didn't invent electric cars, he invented a perpetual motion machine of money.", "created_utc": 1588389377.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gbzemv/the_one_weird_42069_iq_trick_elon_knows_so_he/", "is_self": true}
