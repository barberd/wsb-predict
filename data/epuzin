{"id": "epuzin", "title": "Alibaba ($BABA) will keep dropping! Till it doesnt anymore...", "selftext": "Alibabas price drop will continue until next Wednesday due to a spike in sell side trade volume.\n\n[Altaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altaba) is the company left over when Yahoo! was bought out by Verizon. It was made up of various assets that in time we're sold off, with only 5 million shares of Alibaba stock left as the remaining part of its planned dissolution.\n\nOn Monday it [announced plans to liquidate 5 million shares](https://www.barrons.com/articles/altaba-begins-sale-of-remaining-alibaba-stake-51579020598) in the \"days to come\" with 1 million shares sold that day. Daily movement of BABA is ~13 million shares, having 5 million shares unloaded over the course of the week has certainly impacted the price. \n\nCurrently [Altaba.com](https://www.altaba.com/) has an updated tally on shares sold, ~3.4million as of today. Assuming they sold 1 million shares the day of the announcement then they have averaged ~800 million shares a day every day after (but likely not as linear as that).  That leaves 1.6 million shares to be sold on Friday (and possibly bleeding into Monday based on this assumed average).\n\nDue to the dual listing nature of Alibaba we will see continued drops in prices on the US side that will in turn negatively impact the HK listing. Just as increased buying on one side has seen the recent driving up in price this rush of selling will see a spiraling effect in the short term.\n\nMy belief is the pricing decline will continue to $215-$219 until Altaba announces completion of the indicated sale (again likely early next week) plus a short period for the information to be disseminated (my hope is the close of next week) before we a rise of price.\n\nWith all that said this is a **buying opportunity in Calls.** Looking to buy 1/31 strikes on the cheap in anticipation of a slow rise in price and huge increase in interest for the first earnings call (Jan 28) since the dual listing went live.\n\nAlso targeting June calls as that will have put the HK listing at over the 6 months mark, which while not rule, will likely make it eligible for the \"Shanghai Hong Kong stock connect\". This will make Alibaba eligible for investment by mainland Chinese investors (many mistakenly believe the HK listing did that) which may materially affect pricing.\n\nAlso TSLA will hit $420 again....", "created_utc": 1579233145, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/epuzin/alibaba_baba_will_keep_dropping_till_it_doesnt/", "is_self": true}
