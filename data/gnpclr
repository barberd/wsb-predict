After the reverse split Now it says I can\u2019t buy more but can only sell, but who can I sell them too if  nobody can buy them now? I\u2019m confused about this, can people only not buy on Robinhood or is this option no longer available on any platform? I thought I was only partly autistic but now realize I am full on retarded. I need help.\nEdit- they were the 7 dollar calls", "created_utc": 1590031611.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gnpclr/i_held_calls_through_a_reverse_split_for_acb/", "is_self": true}
