{"id": "b039c5", "title": "$BA issues 737 MAX software enhancement press release - offers condolences to families of both crashes. A little sleuthy DD inside.", "selftext": "[Press Release](https://boeing.mediaroom.com/news-releases-statements?item=130402)\n\nOnly a few hours ago the FAA and $BA both said these jets are deemed \"airworthy\" and there's nothing to fear. Both also stated that it's too early come to any conclusions. Oddly enough though, they've been working closely together to patch the MCAS software for months. This is the software many believe led to the Lion Air crash last year.\n\nI've seen the arguments from the bulls here about the smoke and sputtering noises before the crash, leading some to believe that this is an isolated incident. The eerie similarity is in how the Ethiopian flight just decided to nose dive directly into the ground after [experiencing unstable vertical speed after takeoff](https://twitter.com/flightradar24/status/1104671024581357568).  It's not crazy to think some kind of mechanical failure happened, the pilots attempted to compensate, and this piece of software decided it knew best and sent the jet crashing towards earth.\n\nYou'd have to be both retarded and blind not to recognize that both of these organizations understood the dangers of these jets, and continued to let them fly. 2 out of the (350) 737 MAX 8's in commercial use have violently nose dived mere minutes after take off. Killing every passenger and crew member in both instances. ROUGHLY .6% OF THESE FUCKING DEATH TRAPS HAVE EXPLODED WITH LESS THAN 2 YEARS OF USE UNDER THEIR BELT. That is insane.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what's my point here? *Culpability.*  Both the FAA and $BA have stated that these planes are just fine, yet they're actively working to solve the safety issues. They've got nearly 400 fatalities on their hand at this point, have essentially admitted guilt with their condolences and software development, yet rather than admitting they fucked up the first time around, they're doubling down.\n\nTo make matters worse, take a look at the [insider trading records from the last few months](https://i.imgur.com/7OXK6B6.png). I suppose an argument could be made that these execs were just cashing in on historically high prices. What's really fucking odd though is the EVP and General Counsel to $BA gifted half of his shares to an undisclosed party, and the other half of his shares to his wife, who then transferred to a trust on October 29th 2018. Yes, that's the [date of the first 737 MAX 8 crash](https://i.imgur.com/yNaTwXK.png). What a coincidence. Then, a few weeks after the black box was dug out of the ocean, [he and his wife sell 8,500 shares, or 69% of their disclosed shares](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/12927/000122520819002329/xslF345X03/doc4.xml), on the open market. [It's worth noting that officials claimed it could take a few weeks to recover the data.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-crash/no-public-details-on-crashed-lion-air-voice-recorder-until-final-report-indonesian-official-idUSKCN1PG08R)\n\nThis is just one example. Go look up the other execs. Equally suspect shit going on with quite a few of the officers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWho cares though, right? You should if you hold a bullish position on this stock. Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore, head of the House Transportation Committee, stated that  [\"heads will roll at the FAA if they're not confident in their data and the safety of this plane\"](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/feinstein-blumenthal-lead-dem-pressure-on-boeing-after-deadly-ethiopian-airlines-crash).  \n\nIf that happens, let's be real here, heads are gonna to roll at GM as well. Once the investigations start, shit is gonna hit the fan. Remember what happened to Ford with the whole [exploding pinto scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Pinto#Legal_cases)? Around 1979  the corporation was *charged with murder,* paid a disclosed $128M ($450M today), and who knows how much they settled for out of court. Oh, and more importantly for you bulls, their [stock price plummeted by 66%](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/F/ford-motor/stock-price-history) and didn't recover for 3 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# SHORT $BA\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Disclaimer: This isn't actual investment advice. I seriously don't know wtf I'm doing. I'm just bearish on this stock and looking for ways to confirm my bias.* ", "created_utc": 1552363330, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b039c5/ba_issues_737_max_software_enhancement_press/", "is_self": true}
