The enrollment has been completed and majority of patients have also completed the dosing phase. The results are expected in August/early September time frame.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven though the share price has had a nice run already, the market cap is still only about 100 million, which is way below what it should be considering the peer group and the current clinical results they already have (see the original post for details). But I suspect the market cap continues to approach more appropriate level especially when institutional investors start to take positions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd in case you missed it, Biogen just reported that their phase 3 failed. Over 20 billion in market cap was instantly lost by them and Eisai.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "created_utc": 1554281066, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b8vewz/ntrp_alzheimers_disease_co_is_starting_to_have/", "is_self": true}
