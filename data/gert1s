I have already executed selling the 310C 5/29 and I would feel comfortable telling people to do credit spreads even more ITM. I am considering doubling down.\n\nMy current positions - Selling:  \n\n5/8 315/320C - 1.20 Premium \n\n5/29 310C - 8.44 premium. \n\nI have no idea how low this will go, so I am not buying puts. I will consider it though.\n\nI feel incredibly confident that I will win on both.\n\nAs I predicted, we had a negative month over month sales data for the entire company. April Sales are a calamity due to lower foot count. I love how they over hype the e-commerce portion especially to show the grim reality that people are fucking poor now.\n\n\\-4.7% in April. Best of luck out there gentleman. This is not bullish when grocery stores are starting to see negative sales.\n\nStock is down 1% AH.\n\nMy post -  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gbjine/costco\\_guy\\_update\\_to\\_cost\\_play/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gbjine/costco_guy_update_to_cost_play/)\n\nAs we reflect on one of the comments. Costco's sales data is not up at all. It's down Charlie Murphy.\n\nEdit - Date of record on the dividend is May 8th as well. So I may buy puts tomorrow at close.", "created_utc": 1588796743.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gert1s/costco_guy_april_sales_data_dd_earnings_play/", "is_self": true}
