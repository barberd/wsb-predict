{"id": "goukgu", "title": "PDT and minimizing losses", "selftext": "Since this is WSB and over half of you have locked your account for 90 days from day trading to secure $3 off a call you bought 1 minute prior to selling. Here is some help on Minimizing your loss on a losing play by converting it into a spread. \n\nYou decided today was the day to purchase Disney calls at open. You spent $150 bucks on a DIS 123c that expires next Friday. You are down and you want to sell your position but you cant. Sell a Disney put at a lower strike price. DIS 122c that expires the same day at the moment you realize you suck at options is worth $120 bucks. You just now minimized your losses. You are down $30. If Disney goes to 0, you didnt lose all of your premium. \n\nNow Monday Disney opens at 110, Your 123c loses value, and your 122c that you sold loses value. Rumor mill is saying Disney is announcing that it is going to open on Thursday. You can buy back your call that you sold, because its worth less, and hold your call that you bought and hope it goes up. Otherwise if you think disney is going to keep going down, you can let both contracts expire worthless,  and boom. You only lost 30 dollars. \n\nNow lets say you held both positions and on Thursday Disney ROCKETED to 150 bucks a share. Your an idiot for holding a position that long that you were trying to minimize your losses on, shoulda exited on Monday. BUT if your call that you sold gets exercised your loss is now $130. The original 30 that you lost plus the 1.00 between the strike prices of your spread. Which is still less than the 150 that you thought you were going to lose on your Disney call. \n\nThere have been a few times that I have personally tried to cover my loss by legging into a spread, and then purchased back my insurance and the shares moved in my direction. So I made money on the drop because of the call I sold, and then it rebounded in time for the call I bought to profit too. \n\nMoral of the story, research spreads. Learn how to leg into them. They can be VERY useful.", "created_utc": 1590191114.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/goukgu/pdt_and_minimizing_losses/", "is_self": true}
