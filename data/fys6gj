Shut up.  These people were almost fucking dead already.  Out of those that were so fucking roasted they were allowed to inject some completely unknown substance into their body, *only 13% died.*  This is compared to a study in UK with 98 patients where 80% of those that sick died.  **13% versus 80%.  Do the fucking math.**\n\n2) Yeah okay liver enzymes went up mildly to moderately and organ failure was seen in the people given remdesivir.  Who fucking cares?  They have a body being ravaged by some sister of tequilabacterum.  There's already organ failure.\n\n3) This will ONLY BE BETTER if given earlier.  Its even been shown in monkeys that *remdesivir given prophylactically (before they were sick retards) prevented lung damage 100%.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is the treatment (for now).  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLONG 5/1 $GILD $100C", "created_utc": 1586563282.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fys6gj/first_study_shows_13_given_remdesivir_died_vs_80/", "is_self": true}
