Everyone has been waiting for it to crash for 10 fucking years.\n2. Lose monetary policy. QE.\n3. Lose monetary policy. Not QE.\n4. Lose monetary policy. Leverage.\n5. Lose monetary policy. Buybacks.\n6. Lose monetary policy. Cheap fucking debt.\n7. Lose monetary policy. Everything fucking bubble.\n8. Systemic risks. Too many to list.\n9. ETFs and shit. Welcome to the everything sell off.\n\nWhats gonna happen:\n\n1. Pullback, Fed steps in... blah blah blah Its not over, we got ways to go. Buckle up for a volatile ride, retards.\n2. Return of stock pickers, demise of retards. No more investing in sectors, ETFs,  and pipe dreams for a while. Better have cash flow or your stock is shit. There will be great buying opportunities in a few months. You need to understand why a company or anyone else would care about equity price in the first place before buying in. Otherwise play cash settled products and bonds.\n3. Dollar moons for all of the Forex babas, its the best fish in the shitpond. Pays to be the world reserve currency. \n4. Treatment and management of the virus will be out well before the vaccine. Enjoy the spikes in biotechs for now.\n5. Decentralization of the supply chain. China's real problems are just staring. Their real estate is next.\n6. Deflationary period due to a lack of people's savings, layoffs, and bankruptcies. Followed by and inflationary period lagging MMT and more expensive goods. BTFD buy the fucking dip when it gets here wspecially when real estate gets cheap. Long inflation and short the dollar with a 30yr mortgage at a low rate.", "created_utc": 1583116956, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fc5b08/the_crash_isnt_about_corona_virus/", "is_self": true}
