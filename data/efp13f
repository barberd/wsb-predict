{"id": "efp13f", "title": "90 day trade restriction from Robinhood, Time to leave.", "selftext": "On the day of Christmas Eve my Robinhood gave to me. A 90 day restriction on buying. And a partridge in a pear \ud83c\udf32\nI was down and didn't want to lose even more. Had already taken my 90 day - day trading restriction a week earlier. This 90 day restriction is now , no buying any stocks. So it's obviously time to leave, at least for now.\nBeen trading for 2 years. Only on RH, mainly because it was easy GUI and how I started\n\nAnyways, I want to find a different app/brokerage to use stock options with. Low or minimal fees, what's WSB's broker of choice. Outside ofcourse the infamous RH.\n\nAlso, are the requirements, including to obtain options trading, and margin work different I'm sure. I can read entire websites but if anyone has a good suggestion or I could sign up under someone? Sure. \ud83c\udf84 \n\nMerry Christmas Autists", "created_utc": 1577324734, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/efp13f/90_day_trade_restriction_from_robinhood_time_to/", "is_self": true}
