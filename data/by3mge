And when it came time early this AM to take a position, I put in a limit order for 16, knowing the ipo range was 16-18. I really like this company, increasing sales, already profitable, margins are growing, owners know business, large portfolio keeps them nimble, capturing that high end niche with close to $300 avg tickets, working on own brands which will only add to bottom line, great marketing strategy (right now).  \n\nBUT I just didnt think the market would be on it out of the gate. Thought it would pop but not like it did and not immediately. \n\nThat being said, theres a ton of life ahead. Would you just pass on this stock altogether knowing you missed big or would you get in, at a much worse position? But still a position I feel has a large margin of safety? \n\nThoughts?", "created_utc": 1559965212, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/by3mge/new_trader_made_mistake_should_i_put_the_rvlver/", "is_self": true}
