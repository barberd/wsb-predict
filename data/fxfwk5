{"id": "fxfwk5", "title": "Disney + jump is a tremendous opportunity to short, people are smoking crack if they think 3.6 billion in revenue from the streamer is enough to offset the plunge in revenue from theme parks, cruises, etc.", "selftext": "Disney's 2019 FY revenue was 70 billion. Roughly 55% of that came from theme parks. Theme parks are effectively going to be closed until a vaccine is released, which is March of next year at record-breaking earliest. Then you have their merchandise, which isn't being bought. Then you have film releases, that are either being delayed or released directly onto the platform (thus being a huge loss compared to a theatrical release). Then you have their cruise industry, that is effectively shut down. Then you have their channels like ABC, ESPN, which are going to see tremendous drops in ad revenue from no live sports, and fewer people watching broadcast as they focus on more streamers. Then you have all films and TV in production halted, thus pushing next year's slate further. Their cost of acquiring Fox for something like 52.4 billion isn't going to see any returns on investment for another year down the road.\n\nFuck the Mouse. August puts at  a 95 strike. Throw your remind mes in the comments. Mickey gonna be a lot like Minnie when reality cuts his balls off, and holds them until the vaccine.", "created_utc": 1586383360.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxfwk5/disney_jump_is_a_tremendous_opportunity_to_short/", "is_self": true}
