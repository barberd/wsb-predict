{"id": "hhkpmr", "title": "General Mills Calls???", "selftext": "I'm thinking about buying up a lot of OTM calls for GIS with their earnings report this upcoming week. Looking for the run up play to make some quick tendies, regardless of the outcome of the report. However, the news surrounding the company looks to support a good earnings report which might be worth holding the calls through. They are really low priced at the moment and would be a perfect dip buy right now for the reversal. Anyone else have any info on whether this is looking like a good play and the possible profit potential.", "created_utc": 1593372616.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hhkpmr/general_mills_calls/", "is_self": true}
