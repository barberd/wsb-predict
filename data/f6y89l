They went to court on Tuesday and the news about the decision to resume clearing the forest is expected today or tomorrow (but be aware it might be delayed till the weekend). Here is a quote from an article posted earlier this afternoon.\n\n\"Now the Berlin court has to decide. \"The judges have been providing intensive advice on the case since Tuesday,\" said OVG spokesman Ulrich Marenbach. \u201cThe decision could be made on Thursday evening, at the latest on Friday. So that if Tesla makes a positive decision, it can clear before the breeding period. \"\n\nLink to article, you have to translate it, but it is a few paragraphs down.

Not sure if it will be before the bell tomorrow, but signs point to that.  (Article was from 02/19/2020  [https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-giga-berlin-resume-work-next-week-economic-minister/](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-giga-berlin-resume-work-next-week-economic-minister/)) \n\nLoad up on calls cause TSLA is cheap right now. It will surely pop after this news get released (if the court decision is good, which it should be). A lot of people shorting TSLA so any catalyst will send it flying again. \n\nDecision might come tonight or tomorrow during trading. But there is also a risk it won't come until the weekend. So 2/21 calls look good, cheaper but more risk. Or 2/28 is a little safer but more expensive.\n\nPSA: This is not market advice, only information. I am not saying this is guaranteed.
