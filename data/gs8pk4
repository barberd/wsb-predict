Well, here is a company that is \"outright fraud\", according to Muddy Waters (a.k.a. the same analysts who shorted Luckin Coffee).  \n\nI have put a lot of money into this position. **The evidence of fraud is so overwhelming that I expect the company to crater over the next few months.**  \n\nThe basic gist is that:  \n- Muddy Waters estimates ~70% of GSX's users are fake  \n- While GSX is audited by Deloitte, a legit firm, it appears that the specific engagement partner \"had a suspicious and limited engagement history that read like a who\u2019s-who of disgraced Chinese education firms.\"  \n- GSX commissions bot operators to sign-up for its classes, proceeding to book that fake revenue to pump its numbers up. (a fact verified by a former bot network manager)  \n- GSX greatly understates its expenses.  \n- GSX's verified engineer job listings seem to match those of a bot network operator, rather than an ed-tech service. For example, they ask for people with experience with bot-network frameworks + phone rooting experience.  \n  \n    \n**Moreover, I expect GSX to go bust by the fall, due to two factors:**  \n- Luckin' Coffee's implosion means Chinese investigators will be more aggressive in shutting down fraudulent companies  \n- Congress has taken an aggressive stance against Chinese companies that don't disclose their internal books to the SEC. The Senate recently passed the [Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/945/text), and individual Senators have been nudging the SEC to investigate the Chinese companies listed on American exchanges (as it happens, GSX is an easy target for regulators, compared to JD or BABA)\n  \n  \n\n**Report links**:\n\n[Initial Report](https://www.muddywatersresearch.com/research/gsx/mw-is-short-gsx/)\n\n[Follow-on Report](https://www.muddywatersresearch.com/research/gsx/small-classes-big-lies/)\n\nOther short-sellers of GSX: Citron, Scorpio VC, Grizzly", "created_utc": 1590680961.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gs8pk4/short_gsx_the_outright_fraudulent_company/", "is_self": true}
