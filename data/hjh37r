We are looking at multiple years of 100% revenue growth and the stock is trading at a significant discount to peers. A short squeeze has recently been triggered which should accelerate the near term upside. The best part is this is better than COVID-proof, the company is actually seeing business increase because of the current pandemic. DD is below (very long)\n\nI recommend reading the company's presentation (a lot of my info comes direct from here):  [https://catasys.com/pdf/Catasys-Presentation.pdf](https://catasys.com/pdf/Catasys-Presentation.pdf)\n\n**Company Overview**\n\nCatasys (NASDAQ: CATS) is a AI-powered, teleheath-enabled virtualized outpatient treatment company serving the behavioral health market in the US. Now what exactly does that mean? In short, CATS contracts with health insurers and uses their proprietary data model to:\n\n1. Identify problem patients that are costing the health insurers tons of money a year. Think the drug addict that also has diabetes... These people cost the insurers money well in excess of the average patient on the plan because they end up in ambulances or overdoses, or other costly treatments. The company refers to this population of eligible patients as the eligible pool. As of 1Q20, the pool stood at 145,000 (up from 47,000 in 1Q19).\n2. Get these patients into their treatment plan by contacting them through the phone, email, snail mail, you name it. The company estimates they can get 25% of the eligible patients into the program after about a year. The company changes $8,500 per year per patient. It is important to note the company is constantly refining its marketing program to fit each population and uses data to improve the enrollment rate. Also important to note that some amount of patients drop out of the program and so the company does not receive full revenue for them (estimates net revenue is $6,500 a year per patient). Since COVID, the company has stated that not only has enrollment rate improved, but the dropout rate has also declined. More on this later. The company refers to the patients currently in the treatment program as enrolled members. In 1Q20, the number of enrolled members was 8,600 (up from 3,120). As of the press release yesterday, the number of enrolled members is now at 12,000.\n3. Treat the patients. Now CATS is tasked with treating the patients. They do this by assigning a nurse to each patient that will be with them from beginning to end. The nurse keeps in constant contact with the patient through telephone, video conference, etc. The nurse sets up appointments with doctors, psychiatrists, etc. to help the patient treat their underlying health issues. The company states the program typically runs for 10-12 months and then the patient \"graduates\" if they their behavioral health issues are curtailed.\n\n**Value Proposition**\n\n* So why does CATS provide value to the insurers? The company has done extensive research into this point and basically what the data proves out is that if you can treat the behavioral health issues, the overall cost of the patient can be drastically improved.\n* It is important to note that the company is only targeting high costs patients that have 2 or more issues (so diabetes and drug abuse, or hypertension and depression/anxiety, etc.) The idea is that the behavioral health issues actually increases the cost to the insurer caused by the diabetes or other health issue.\n* From the company's presentation they say the cost savings after a patient is graduated from the program is roughly 5:1 ROI for the insurers. This cost savings is further vetted by continued expansions from health insurers. Case in point is Aetna which expanded into 4 additional states in April 2020 after being seeing the results from the program in its other locations.

CATS has been expanding rapidly. Health plans that have been using the program in one state have been expanding to others and increasing the potential revenue opportunity for CATS.\n* With the current enrolled members of 12,000 (up 40%! from 1Q) the company would run-rate revenue $72mn ($6,500 x 12,000). However, the company is planning on expanding a lot more in the next 12 months. Case in point, yesterday it was announced the company has signed a national plan with Cigna that would expand to all states Cigna currently provides healthcare in. [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200630005145/en/National-Health-Plan-Expands-Catasys%E2%80%99-OnTrak-CI-Program](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200630005145/en/National-Health-Plan-Expands-Catasys%E2%80%99-OnTrak-CI-Program)\n* The company has stated this plan should add \\~$100mn. So now we are looking at run-rate revenue of $172mn just based on where the company is today (not factoring in the growth that will undoubtedly happen in the second half of this year).\n* To put this all into context, the company did $35mn in 2019. The company has guided to $90mn in revenue in 2019 (definitely looking at upside over this number - my estimate is $100mn for the year). But 2021 is where the bacon is going to get cooked with revenue $200mn-$300mn IMO.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The chart is also beautiful here and provides a great setup for technical traders to take this to new highs in the near term](https://preview.redd.it/vjdmcm5jqa851.png?width=948&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c7eed52c52ee665ddba57da3c167954fe458bad)\n\n**COVID Impacts**\n\n* The company saw enrollment accelerate in March and has stated that this effect has continued into April, May and even June. This is because people are staying at home more and therefore are more easily enrolled into the program (and probably more open to telehealth solutions in general). Its peers LVGO and TDOC have also seen these positive effects on their businesses\n* COVID is also increasing the amount of behavioral health patients and the severity of these patient's symptoms as the stress from the pandemic exacerbates these health effects. This is all upside that will hit the company's financials **this year.**\n\n**Valuing the Stock**\n\n* Peers in this space typically trade on multiples of revenue. You can look at companies like LVGO and TDOC for examples. 7-12x current year revenues look to be about standard.\n* CATS is currently trading at 4.7x the $90mn guided revenue ($425mn market cap / $90mn revenues) so its well below peers. The company has stated the $90mn figure does not factor into it any additional expansions, only the planned rollouts it has announced.\n* I think I am being conservative when I say revenue next year will be $225mn. If we take a 7x multiple to that figure we are looking at a market cap of $1.575bn. That is \\~4x upside from the price today and the stock should trade that way by December 2020 (to be forecasting 1 year ahead).\n* The Stock is currently at \\~$25 a share. It would be $100 a share with this market cap. If this starts trading inline with peers we are looking at $200 a share.\n* Anyway you cut it the company is poised for rapid growth over the next few years and the stock will trade accordingly. We all know the market loves companies with a good growth story and here we have an excellent one which is still flying below the radar.\n\n**Further Upside**\n\n* All of this analysis does not taking into account new products the company is developing. One thing that caught my eye was the company upgraded its management team earlier this year and late last year. The CFO, Brandon LaVerne came from a $2.2bn Tech company PCM where he helped the company to acquire 14 companies in his 12 years there. I think CATS has similar upside in being able to grow through acquisition.\n* Using their strong data analysis and proprietary models, they should be able to start addressing other areas of healthcare spend and drive additional growth. The company already is close to launching its second product, Ontrak-lite which is a pared down version of their current offering that addresses lighter versions of behavioral health using the same principals outlined above.\n\n**How to Print Tendies**\n\n* The company has an extremely low float and high short interest. Currently only 17mn shares are outstanding, of which 56% is owned by the CEO. So the float is around 7mn. Of this, over 50% is sold short. Of the remaining only 25% is held by institutions.\n* So what does this mean? It means shares are hard to accumulate. Because the company has such great long term prospects (and is not currently marginable), the best way to provide upside is buying far dated OTM call options. I like the November $35 and $40 calls\n* It looks like a short squeeze has been started based on national rollout plan. Another way to capture some sweet juicy tendies is to buy the near dated calls. I myself own July $25s and Aug $30s\n\nTL;DR\n\n* Stock is a high-growth name trading at significant discounts to peers with a foolproof business plan it is doing an excellent job of executing on\n* CATS has seen more growth due to COVID and anticipates these positive effects to continue\n* Recent national plan announcement has started a short squeeze which should continue due to the low float and low liquidity on the stock that should push it over $30 in the near term\n* Tendies", "created_utc": 1593631381.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hjh37r/cats_an_under_the_radar_telehealth_play_with_10x/", "is_self": true}
