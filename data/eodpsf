I made 50% alone on the premium spike alone today, so this is looking like a massive short squeeze incoming.  \n\nHere is my theory:\n\nCitron is currently saying this is going to 5$.  I think this is 1 firm setting up for a massive short squeeze by telling everyone its going to 5$, and thus people short it. This is the only firm in the news so I think its like a reverse pump so people leverage thinking its going down before rug pull.  With firms still opening large positions in this, I do not see this going down much to 5$ anytime too soon.\n\nWhat I foresee, is massive short squeeze, with meme stock potential.  \n\nRuns all of February, trades at stupid heights that aren't justifiable in the slightest, but because analysts keep pumping it after a good ER, they literally bankrupt all the common people bag holding these shorts, making a killing.  So, ER Kills, short squeeze.  Calms down, a few upgrades later, bam we hit like 18-20B market cap around Early march.  Then, thats when the lockup expires, and people gonna dump shares like a MF. \n\nCurrently, Im literally just gonna put a few thousand in this (most of my gambling money) and ride it out through ER.  \n\nNOW IF I am right on my short squeeze theory, which fingers crossed, I am gonna ride it out near my calls expiration date, and either sell and roll forward, or if I feel its peaked I will sell them and so forth.   Then, hopefully at this point I have a decent amount of money, and then I will just buy puts going into the Lockup and ride it on the way down.  At that point, I will either 1.  Post loss porn for this journey \n\nor 2\n\nPost some nice gain porn, withdraw most of it, hire an accountant to figure out my tax situation, get that squared away, and go from there.  Who knows.  \n\nWish me luck, and godspeed fellow autists.", "created_utc": 1578964097, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eodpsf/update_150k_spent_on_pton_calls_for_35_and_50/", "is_self": true}
