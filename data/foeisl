Dew in their face.\n\nNow calls on those two staples might be a good idea. But, lets think further out and at a bigger cash grab; a year from now, when everyone is over it. People are going to look at their fat ass in the mirror, realize their short short skits no longer fit, and cutoffs look gay, and be disgusted. What will they do, the gym? At first, then fail, and then go for all the other easier products.\n\nSo I say Leap calls on \n\ngyms: PLNT, LTM, BC, NLS, and weight loss programs: NTRI, MED, WTW and fitness products: FIT, DXCM, BEAT and selling them right before everyone fails their new years resolution a few months in 2021.\n\nThen round two, when people realize gyms are for meat heads, and not the average person, and go looking towards another easy solution of supplements and vitamins: GNC, VSI, HLF, NUS, USNA along with their organic food: HAIN, UNFI.\n\nAnd as someone pointed out BYND, because corona will definitely mutate across more species and more people will become vegan.", "created_utc": 1585088431.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/foeisl/during_lockdown_everyone_is_going_to_get_fat/", "is_self": true}
