{"id": "git8jz", "title": "$ZUO DD- The next TWLO? (Actually spent time and braincells on this)", "selftext": "DISCLAIMER: (This was written on 70 mg adderall and I started trading shit about 3 weeks ago so don't think im some kind of genius, I did make a chegg DD a few days before CHGG earnings and I was correct though ALSO LOW VOLUME SINCE 1 YEAR OLD COMPANY SO IF IM WRONG THEN UR FUCKED OR IM RIGHT AND VOLUME WILL BE NO ISSUE WHEN EARNINGS COME)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**$Zuo**, is a company in which COVID magnified. We've all seen how cloud companies are skyrocketing because many businesses are using them for integration etc. Think of it like shopify, except Zuora is only a year old company and shopify went up over 120% since march... Zuo only up 50%. THIS IS A YEAR OLD COMPANY SO LOTS OF POTENTIAL. It's competettiors are like shopify and shit I think.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Zuora is an enterprise software company that creates and provides software for businesses to launch and manage their subscription-based services. Zuora\u2019s applications are designed to automate recurring billing, collections, quoting, revenue recognition, and subscription metrics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese are the applications that $Zuo offers,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qtvf7ybrxgy41.png?width=557&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e17e180c42180ecb089c3d5497bd23401c04036\n\nThis company has earnings that will be reported on June 3rd and its current trading price is 12$ This company is also only a year old with it being well below its all time high which is $33.88.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3bpp6725xgy41.png?width=630&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fb483e8c8a4a3c03c2816b5665ab42ef6ffcd00\n\nI'm not going to give you my FULL research on this because I know nobody will read it and or care so I will just give one very interesting thing that I thought about. I thought about was what companies use ZUO? Now I found many companies that use it but the one that stood out was ZOOM. I went to their payments page and looked at their source code to confirm,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xmidkpxyxgy41.png?width=352&format=png&auto=webp&s=76da19079225de9903db575ec2697e5bb79b8bdb\n\nNow, if we look at Zooms pricing plans, they offer many different packages\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kfvnph22ygy41.png?width=1059&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3b2566136591d2bfcdb613af5935f1debc29780\n\nNot only this but also many 'add ons'\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2nf8spn3ygy41.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a468accd6b5207d21de0f8bfd9ac4a4838fc45e\n\nAll of these packages/add ons look very reasonable for big companies and schools to buy because of their utilities.  Now looking at Zoom's financials, their buisness model is based on subscriptions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qngrl9hdygy41.png?width=524&format=png&auto=webp&s=26e07a319cf244d4300bd70bf67f6975e6ec8e61\n\nSo with the populaurity of zoom and seeing how much it went up Im assuming this only benefits $Zuo\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe more interesting part is that ZOOM will report earnings a few days before ZUO which is very good because im expecting huge growth from zoom which in part will make ZUO skyrocket. Keep in mind ZUO has MANY companies that use it im just using Zoom as an example.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow for Zuora, I looked at their transcript from their last earnings call (March 13th)  guidance was reported as,\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vqfs5xue1hy41.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bd339b88cd82d27d918f5eea9f6ba268b27d419\n\nThis led to,\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q96qumdi1hy41.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=89ace421568c01219d8637af5d9fc308316e9a82\n\nNow from what i'm thinking, this will lead investors to estimate a bigger loss than usual for $Zuo, I think that this earnings call , happening in early march was a blessing because coronavirus impact was just starting to really ramp up and they didn't see the positive effects yet. Using this based off other stocks such as ZOOM who went up over 60% since March 13th. Keep in mind SHOPIFY, the competitor went up over 120% since march..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFuthermore, Zuo appointed a chief revenue officer who has a good track record.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3g38hu3q2hy41.png?width=778&format=png&auto=webp&s=312f9579197a4e5a24a2077eb872b441f290465e\n\nIm hoping that his connections helped him make big deals with companies,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ybnbb9z53hy41.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c286d3ddf3783053f8a21d125edadfdb813def1\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would add more but I'm sure nobody read all of this so I will just stop now. Theres much more I can add but I advise you all to do your own research since im a idiot.  I have a really good feeling about $ZUO... but DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH. I did not look at their financials from past quarters etc as I don't think the market gives a fuck and only cares about the past few months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope mods don't delete my dd post again and keep for themselves smh... I posted about this last week and it went up 15% since then btw. I didn't do actual research on it like this though.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/blgoezvmdhy41.png?width=742&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ab48bbfc47713b429d318ae4c7e8a3dd2937ad2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3xk2i0xr3hy41.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0c86e6f90918ac29fdf0355b60377559069b3cc\n\nI made this post because I know how many new people there are here who play earnings the day or week before so with this post you have a few weeks till ZUO reports their earnings. I also mentioned this stock in one of my other posts 5 days ago and it went up 15% since then..\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfjdab/cloud\\_service\\_tech\\_talks\\_with\\_upcoming\\_earnings/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfjdab/cloud_service_tech_talks_with_upcoming_earnings/)\n\nI don't know how much money they make off subscription or the payment plans or if its a one time thing so PLEASE do your own research lol. \n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1589350066.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/git8jz/zuo_dd_the_next_twlo_actually_spent_time_and/", "is_self": true}
