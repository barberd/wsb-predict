Like our late hero I also am absolving myself of responsibility by not personally recommending any of the following positions.\n\nu/kingkrool57 and u/LMAY75 both posted individual DDs on Dollar Tree. The crux of the case seems to be Dollar Tree\u2019s strong positioning in the event of a recession as well as it\u2019s competitor, Dollar General being up 14% to a new All time High while Dollar Tree remains 17% below its all time highs. As well dollar tree holds $1.9 billion in cash on hand giving it ample reserves the weather the recently imposed lock downs.

This user is an engineer of 7 years in the world of cyber security and brings the case that the world has been moving towards two factor authentication and multi factor authentication for years now and the effect of COVID on the work at home demographic looks only to accelerate this trend. Cisco owns a competing product to Okta known as DUO but word on the r/street is that it sucks. Okta is set to report earnings on May 28th and looks to continue its strong upward trajectory. Okta trades under the ticker OKTA. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gl1p50/okta_earnings_528/\n\nIn an unexciting but likely correct call appropriately named user DrTendies recommends McDonalds corporation as a strong investment citing its 2.85% dividend annual yield and its strong position in the recession resistant fast food market.

Citing a paper from Wolfpack Research Qwertyrayz posits that IQiyi has likely been inflating their user numbers through methods such as click farming. Wolfpacks research implies that Iqiyis actual user numbers may be 60% lower than their claimed 175 million. This would also lead to IQiyi being able to inflate their revenue numbers. However Qwertyrayz cautions that Baidu has a large stake in Iqiyi and China has a large stake in Baidu, as well as cuationing that their upcoming earnings report may not move Iqiyis price significantly as they are suspected of being fraudulent and likely will not be choosing to turn a new leaf this earnings report. Qwertyrayz is personally \ninvested in the September 18th put option at a strike price of $15. IQiyi trades under the ticker IQ and is trading at $17.60 at the time of this writing down from a 52 week high of $27.50. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gm37gk/short_the_literal_fuck_out_of_iq/\n\nu/AveenoFresh is very bullish on HP inc and recommends to play their likely run up until their after market earnings report on May 27 2020. Aveeno cites the recoveries that other tech companies have had since the March crash and points out HP has yet to experience this to the same extent and they likely will in the days leading up to their quarterly earnings report.  Users in the comments have also pointed out that many items on the HP website are currently out of stock and this is likely due to a large increase in demand.  HP inc trades under the ticker HPQ and is currently at a market value of $16.73 down from a 52 week high of 23.93.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gmrv3j/why_hpq_is_on_my_watchlist_for_next_weeks_earnings/\n\nAdditionally we have a few posts from members of tanker gang continuing their bullish outlook on tankers. As a previous member of said tanker gang I agree with the thesis however oil futures seem to be running contrary to the case, still climbing higher even in the face of futures expiry.", "created_utc": 1589998518.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gngm9f/dd_compilation_518_522/", "is_self": true}
