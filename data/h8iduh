{"id": "h8iduh", "title": "AZN", "selftext": "AstraZeneca looks like it has locked up more deals. Now it will supply 400 million doses to Europe in addition to 320 million for the US. \n\nhttps://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/astrazeneca-agrees-to-make-covid-19-vaccine-for-europe\n\n\nThey also have the most funding from BARDA and most pipeline lines locked up to deliver. The other alternatives so far are MRNA, which has never made a single product, using a vaccine technology never successfully used in any vaccine and if you read there phase 1 results you can see there vaccine wasn't as effective. Plus what pipelines or delivery deals have they actually inked. JNJ is too big 5 times the market cap of AZN.\n\nNow they say they won't profit from it now but Fauci has said antibody levels for coronaviruses don't last long. This is going to be a yearly, mixed in with the flu shot, deal. That and the patents. They are \"drug dealers\" first fix is free after that you got to pay. \n\nIf you're going to be a bull don't be bullish on bullshit. I know that goes against the Ethos of WSB. Drop the Hertz calls and buy AZN it has low IV and a nice market cap compared to JNJ. \n\nPosition: 57.5 C July 17", "created_utc": 1592090753.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h8iduh/azn/", "is_self": true}
