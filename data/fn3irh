Doesn't really matter either way. Just wanted to give some of my perspective on the recent PR involving Amazon. \n\nYou've probably heard that Amazon is aiming to hire 100,000 new employees. As of this week my company has had more routes to drive, but every route is about 60% of a normal sized one. So the idea that there's more work/volume seems like a myth to me. They're just reducing everyone's work and spreading it out to more people. \n\nWhen Amazon does these mass hirings (like around Christmas), it's pretty much guaranteed they won't keep more than 20% of the new hires, and to offset the ones they keep, they'll let go of poor performers who have been there a while. My manager literally told me of the 7 people they just hired, they'll only keep 1-2 of them in the next 90 days. \n\nThey're just taking advantage of this influx of desperate unemployed bastards hoping that 1 in 10 of em isn't a total fucking retard. \n\nAlso worth knowing that it doesn't seem like Amazon gives a single fuck about spreading this virus to the whole damn country. There have been practically zero precautions set in place for drivers. We don't have to wear gloves, masks, anything. They're not screening drivers for illness, so I bet there are plenty of Amazon drivers infected throughout the US right now that are delivering this virus to 500-600 people weekly. Amazon is tiptoeing a giant fucking cliff and so far dominating the PR of the whole situation. But I see through it. \n\nI'm also typing this on the clock. With all the money you make with this info you'll probably be able to afford Amazon Prime, and some retard will deliver the tenders straight to your fucken door. \n\nAMZN 1/1/21 1000p", "created_utc": 1584898679.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fn3irh/im_an_amazon_delivery_driver_definitely_no/", "is_self": true}
