From sales transparency to its customer-focused business model, everything about Costco screams wholesome goodness. The market has rewarded this rare type of business with a monster 36 PE. (TGT - 17.5, WMT 22.23, BBY 13.8) This is really really expensive for a retail sector company. Costco pays a dividend of 2.60$. It has a relatively high institutional ownership of 70%.\n\n**Technical**: Priced above 20, 50, 200 day moving average. MACD shows bearish convergence. RSI shows around 50, coming up from oversold. Options sentiments are very bullish in volume and neutral open interest. Implied movement is 4.8% or about 15.26$ Short interest is at 1.1%, with 2.1 days to cover. Support at 306$, with all time high being 325.26$\n\n**Sentimental**: Costco suffered a steep selloff like the rest of the market. However, it has recovered 75% of the drop this week. One macro sentiment fueling Costco is the stockpile phenomenon. With coronavirus breaking out, many are going to Costco and purchasing out sized bulk goods in preparation. This should lead to an uptick in sales that will help Costco beat Revenue estimates. EPS may be affected due to sickness and preventive measures. Guidance might be affected as well, though I believe that has already been priced in. The main bearish move would be a lackluster guidance or missing EPS. \n\n**Robinhood (3/4/2020) Less Fucky. Not using. Moving to Schwab this weekend.** \n\n**Put Credit Spread 3/13**\n\n**Buy 295 Put**\n\n**Sell 300 Put**\n\n**Everyone loves Costco and the stockpiling will definitely help with sales. The real question is how Costco frames the future given the coronavirus risk.**", "created_utc": 1583434486.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fe00l7/costco_cost_352020_amc_quality_is_expensive/", "is_self": true}
