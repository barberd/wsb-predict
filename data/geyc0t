{"id": "geyc0t", "title": "Oil will rebound this year", "selftext": "Bears have this view of doomsday. Unemployment means no traveling, means imprisonment forever, means black mirror type of life in 2020, and we are so gonna work from home and wear VR headset to communicate with friends and family. Oil is doomed, airlines are doomed, no one would drive. \n\nI've bought puts on hotels before. I just want to point out there won't be permanent change in behaviors with people. People have inertia. Think about how hard it is for people to admit the Earth revolves around the sun. Literally take centuries. While I admit changes come faster with the age of information. But people are warm blooded social creatures that enjoy company. Majority anyway. People are gathering out in the open in NYC right in the start of this month. Google them pics. \n\nFor Pete's sake, people took almost 20 years to accept mass produced electric car. To this day a supersonic corncode plane had been designed but never accepted. \n\nThe first thing that bounce back super hard is going to be travelling. People are going to fly to see their relatives in no time; and yes if you don't have autism, the majority would not even be opened to the idea of holographic projection of their friends let alone we doesn't even have that technology yet. With a supply cut overreaction compounded with a sudden surge in demand, oil price would hit ATH violently. \n\nYour view on forever giving up social life is simply impractical because we don't run on 0 and 1s. \n\nThat said, I want to have a civil discussion with people who hold oil calls. How do you set this up? Like 2021 calls, or 1 short leg and 1 long leg at 6/19, 2021, or calls with selling weekly puts to recoup theta decay from flat days.\n\nhttps://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Egyptian-Billionaire-Buffett-Is-Wrong-Oil-Will-Hit-100-Within-18-Months.html", "created_utc": 1588819374.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/geyc0t/oil_will_rebound_this_year/", "is_self": true}
