{"id": "fogdkx", "title": "China's Plan to Take Over the US (And It's Working So Far)", "selftext": "Before you read it, note this is just a theory. I'm probably wrong. TLDR at the bottom.\n\nBefore Corona Became Known:\n\n1. China devised COVID-19 in a lab and knew it would create chaos as there was no vaccine for it.\n2. In the mean time they were creating the virus, Chinese officials were also drafting plans on how they were going to create makeshift hospitals, get all the masks & respirators that would be needed, and produce the thousands of test kits that would also be needed.\n3. Once the government was prepared, the virus \"accidentally\" escaped a lab somewhere in Wuhan and World War III officially began.\n\nShot Heard Round the World:\n\n1. After the first patient reported was found ill on December 1st, hundreds more cases of Chinese being ill followed. On January 10th, the first death was reported. On January 23rd, the Hubei province was put on lockdown. \n2. Yet, the Chinese were extremely well prepared. A couple of days after Hubei was put on lockdown, 12000 bed hospitals were being built and they were completed in less than 2 weeks. China had all the respirators, gas masks, and other necessary equipment for 2 reasons: 1) the government prepared its stockpiles before they released the virus, and 2) the Chinese are the major producers of such equipment so they can continue to churn out more of it when they are in short supply.\n3. A couple days ago (March 22-23), the Chinese were seen in videos celebrating and even announced they had a potential vaccine. How could they have done it so quickly? Dr. Tony Fauci said it would take *at least 12 to 18 months* for the US to develop a vaccine.\n\nMy Theory\n\n1. After the virus arrived to the US and it started to get more media attention, stocks have collapsed massively relative to their all-time highs in February. Right now, the US is financially defeated and on the verge of falling into what some people think is the Great Recession.\n2. This plot is exactly what the Chinese hoped for. The Chinese have probably bought millions of shares of US companies in hopes of controlling them since they are very cheap at the moment. Further, China is now the largest foreign holder of US Treasury Securities, passing Japan a couple of days ago.\n3. After this virus dies out eventually, the US companies that are controlled by the Chinese will have their capital pass into the hands of China.\n4. China will be able to take over the US this way because it knows it cannot defeat the US militarily as the US is currently the most powerful country. \n\nFurther Thoughts\n\n1. At the peak of the virus epidemic, China's President Xi Jinping wore a face mask to visit Wuhan, the deadliest of the cities hit by covid-19. As a president, he should have been covered from head to toe. However, he knew the virus couldn't harm him because the Chinese have most likely found a cure to the virus, long before it was even released. \n2. Now, China is buying up stocks from countries on the brink of economic collapse because its goal is to control the entire world. Once they are done buying up, the Chinese will publicly announce they have a cure and the world economy will start back up again, with China being the majority shareholder of all stocks. \n\nTLDR: China released COVID-19 and knew the entire time the devastation it would have on the world economy. Before its release, the Chinese government was fully prepared and most likely had a vaccine ready as well. Now, as the US economy begins to collapse, the Chinese are buying up shares of major US companies at discounted prices. Right after the US economy collapses, China will announce it has a vaccine and the world economy will rebound, with China controlling the majority of US companies.", "created_utc": 1585094995.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fogdkx/chinas_plan_to_take_over_the_us_and_its_working/", "is_self": true}
