{"id": "gm402p", "title": "Novavax (NVAX) DD", "selftext": "A brief summary of my NVAX DD, feel free to PM for more details:\n\nNVAX has exploded recently on news of receiving up to 384M in funding from CEPI for its COVID-19 vaccine development program. Shares are up 1000% since the COVID pandemic started. While the details of the funding are unclear, NVAX executives stated during their earnings conference call that a significant portion of the money would be used for manufacturing, with a goal of 100M doses by year end, and 1 billion doses by end of 2021. Doses of a vaccine that they haven\u2019t even started phase 1 trials on.\n\nNVAX portfolio and history:\n\nNovavax is a 33 year old company that has never produced a vaccine. They have never sold a single product.\n\nFinancials in the last 6 years, starting in 2014: loss of 82M, loss of 156M, loss of 279M, loss of 183M, loss of 184M, loss of 132M. \n\nSome other notes:\n\n2015 \u2013 1.5M shares common stock sales for $204M\n\n2016 \u2013 Issued $325M convertible senior unsecured notes for proceeds of $315M\n\n2017 \u2013 2.5M shares common stock sales for $63M\n\n2018 \u2013 2.9M shares common stock sales for $100M\n\n2019 \u2013 13M shares common stock for $98M\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring the 2009 swine flu scare, NVAX received grant funding on prospects of developing an H1N1 vaccine, this bolstered stock prices by more than 500%: [https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/novavax-shares-soar-on-nih-swine-flu-agreement](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/novavax-shares-soar-on-nih-swine-flu-agreement)\n\nThey jumped on the ebola scare in 2014, with share prices nearly tripling [https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/blog/2015/02/gaithersburgs-novavax-begins-phase-1-ebola-vaccine.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/blog/2015/02/gaithersburgs-novavax-begins-phase-1-ebola-vaccine.html)\n\nIn 2015 the Gates foundation gave them $89M for their RSV candidate which failed spectacularly twice.\n\nJust a quick insight into their RSV which failed clinical trials twice. If you had looked into their initial phase 2 result, it had a narrowly significant p-value (0.047) and unusually high attack rate, the phase 3 was destined to fail and was an incredible short opportunity. This was the closest they ever got to a novel vaccine, and it was a vaccine that ultimately should not have even moved into phase 3 if you look into the science. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring this time period of their RSV failure, NVAX again pivoted to try to capitalize on Zika virus: [https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2016/11/11/how-the-zika-virus-could-be-a-major-bright-spot.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2016/11/11/how-the-zika-virus-could-be-a-major-bright-spot.html)\n\n(For a good laugh, read some of the claims and statements from the execs in those links. They are great salesmen I can give them that)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe 8th largest drug company in the world is committing to making 30M doses of vaccine, do you really believe a company that has never sold a single vaccine will make 1 billion doses in 18 months? For a vaccine candidate that hasn\u2019t even started human trials?\n\n\u201cUp to\u201d $384M CEPI funding. No details on structure has been released, with only execs commenting that a significant portion will be for manufacturing. It would not be shocking if a majority (if not all) of that $384M will not be disbursed until they meet clinical milestones. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do they have? A recently successful phase 3 trial for Nanoflu, yet to file for BLA, a flu vaccine for 65yr+ population, intended to be a competitor to Sanofi\u2019s Fluzone high dose, a market that contributed to less than 14% of Sanofi\u2019s $2b flu vaccine sales in 2018-2019. \n\nOf note, many vaccines take multiple phase 3 trials for approval. 69% of infectious disease BLAs receive 1st round approval, 86% 2nd round, and 92% ultimately get approved, with an average time of 1.4yrs from BLA filing date to approval. The Nanoflu phase 3 succeeded on March 24th 2020, resulting in a share price jump from $10 to $12. Clearly this is not entirely derisked. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTldr: If you have the risk tolerance, NVAX is an incredible short opportunity. In the COVID climate, governments and foundations are spewing money blindly, but if you look into the science and data, there is a zero percent chance NVAX develops a vaccine. MRNA reported positive news already, with NVAX not having even started their phase 1. \n\nBefore COVID-19, NVAX was trading as low as $3.70 at the end of 2019, it is now above $50. This is a company that has never sold a single dose of vaccine ever, and yet they\u2019ve suggested they\u2019ll produce 1 billion doses of a covid-19 vaccine by end of 2021. \n\nNVAX jumped 400% on the bird flu scare, 500% on swine flu, 300% on ebola, in addition to receiving millions of grant money, but at the end of the day they were on their last legs just 6 months ago.", "created_utc": 1589817115.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gm402p/novavax_nvax_dd/", "is_self": true}
