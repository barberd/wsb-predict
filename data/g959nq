{"id": "g959nq", "title": "ATVI to ATH (DD Inside)", "selftext": "TLDR and position at bottom. \n\nActivision Blizzard has been on a run since relative low at $52 in March, having peaked at $81 in 2018. Any gamer knows COD:MW has been immensely popular since its release and even more popular with the release of Warzone in March. It was second to only League in twitch viewership in March as seen [here](https://www.statista.com/statistics/509814/leading-games-twitch-by-number-hours-viewed/) (even beating Fortnite). I don't think boomers have accounted for just how popular this game is. And it definitely hasn't thought about what ATVI is doing with its Blizzard segment working on WoW Classic.\n\nLooking at the most recent filing we see that \"Bookings\" fell from 2018 to 2019. This metric includes an important focus of ATVI: shifting revenue into a more recurring model. How are they doing this? Microtransactions - that's right, the same shit that made Fortnite rich. And as of now, Warzone is blowing Fortnite out of the water, so guess who's selling more skins? The drop from 2018 to 2019, even with games like Sekiro and COD:MW (no Warzone yet) helping the business, shows how important bookings is, not just AAA titles crushing the market. What games drove previous bookings? Destiny and BLOPS4. Today we have Warzone and WoW Classic is back (WoW is moving through Blizzards old expansions - Burning Crusade was the most popular expansion ever and its coming soon to WoW Classic) which I think are going to blow the 2018 bookings numbers out of the water along with some other titles. Other things to consider are that in 2018, King segment was banking on boomers playing Candy Crush, I bet they are back for more these days. But also, COD Mobile [blew up](https://www.businessinsider.com/call-of-duty-mobile-downloads-revenue-first-week-2019-10) and has more opportunity to support revenue growth as well with Warzone out now. And even if things with the beervirus improve and venues continue to open, things won't just be back to normal - we are looking at a new trend of spending more time at home and online.\n\nAnother interesting point comes with the release of MW2 campaign remastered. Probably not going to be as huge as Warzone and the bookings argument, but this is a AAA title considered to be the best of COD in many people's hearts and it did not receive much if any media attention because it was a surprise drop. \n\nDevil's Advocate: Release of Valorant (Owned by Tencent) has blown up [recently](https://www.twitchmetrics.net/games/viewership). April numbers show Wow and Hearthstone are still beating Animal Crossing though, which is Nintendo's biggest release. And COD:MW is still high up, slightly lower than Fortnite, perhaps implying Warzone players are more suggestible to what's trending, while Fortnite kids provide a more stable viewership. \n\nTLDR: I think ATVI is successfully shifting its business model to capture more recurring revenue (microtransactions, subscriptions) in all 3 of its business segments and stabilize more of its revenue stream against cyclically releasing AAA titles. New normal will provide further growth opportunity, hopefully Valorant and other titles don't cuck our tendies, but I think numbers and guidance will be positive.\n\nPositions: $70c 5/8 (Earnings is 5/5)", "created_utc": 1588008757.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g959nq/atvi_to_ath_dd_inside/", "is_self": true}
