But I am more bullish on the order.  Yeah - the economy is down yada yada yada- but listen, most TSLA buyers are tech savvy. IBM killed cloud services last week so did intel in data services. That means that commission check needs to be spent y\u2019all. \n\nBA - is the largest exporter of US dollar wise. Good news/bad news I think it will go up  JPowell- somehow they will find a way to bump this shit up. It\u2019s American symbol of success.  \n\nAMZN . Yeah they are hiring left right for warehouse and stuff but that is expected maybe even priced in- NFLX 15 mil news subs cause they stuck at home. Most also would like to get their product shipped quicker so sign for prime membership. If 1/3 of NFLX sign prime yearly (5 mil) that alone is about 1.7$ per share gain. \n\nBut the money is in the cloud services- Zoom and NFLX use amazon cloud. And from why TSLA will explode you saw how intel and ibm did on the AWS core business. So yeah I am very bullish. \n\nWhat are your thoughts", "created_utc": 1587925995.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g8jn2q/divorce_lawyer_etf/", "is_self": true}
