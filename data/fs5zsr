WTI Crude is at $21.56 per barrel as of now. \n\nThat being said, American oil companies are fuk. It\u2019s just simply not profitable for them to produce oil at these prices and there is not much they can do about it. \n\nwww.cnbc.com/amp/2020/03/30/coronavirus-oil-crash-the-us-is-set-to-lose-top-oil-producer-title-yergin-says.html\n\nNow, I feel like it won\u2019t stay that low for too too long for political reasons (also because of Saudi\u2019s and Russian financial stability.) That being said, I thought it\u2019ll be beneficial to have a discussion on what plays can be done in the oil industry? \n\nTL:DR open discussion on what plays can be done in the oil industry. Short, long, options, stocks, whatever it is. If you have anything in mind I want to hear it ! \n\nPositions: SPY 4/17 $230p and SPY 5/15 $235p.", "created_utc": 1585627247.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fs5zsr/oil_at_an_18_years_low_opportunity_of_a_life_time/", "is_self": true}
