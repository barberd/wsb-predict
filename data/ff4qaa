{"id": "ff4qaa", "title": "My thoughts on India (ETF : INDA)", "selftext": "  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Quick Background**: \n\nIndia has a population of 1.4 billion. It has a growth rate of 1.1% in 2017. It has a mainly young age demographic is 28.1 (2018 est. ). Because of this young population which has been rapidly increasing, its GDP has been rapidly increasing, alongside its influence worldwide and building deeper and more intricate trade relations with other countries, however its growth has been limited by extensive govt corruption from local to national level, high level of inflation, massive amounts of protectionism for its poor farmers \u2013 instead of spending to education the farmers instead. \n\nThe urban growth rate of India has been slowing down in recent years but is still above the global average. India : 2.3% compared to World\u2019s 1.936%.\n\nNow the actual numbers and where options come into play:  \n \n\nThere\u2019s 2 ETF\u2019s for India. INDA and SMIN. I will be doing INDA. Easier to do so as its larger caps. The INDA ETF is made up of:\n\n1. RELIANCE - .  is an Indian conglomerate in all sectors ( like the Indian version of Samsung without the phones, DRAM and other electronics).\n\n2.HDFC is the largest bank by market cap in India and is the largest lender too.\n\n3.INFY -  Infosys Limited is an Indian multinational corporation that provides business consulting, information technology and outsourcing services.\n\n4.ICICIBANK  is the second largest bank in India in terms of assets and market capitalisation.\n\n5.TCS is an Indian multinational information technology service and consulting company \n\n6.HINDUNILVR is the Indian subsidiary of Unilever\n\n7.AXISBANK  is the fifth-largest Indian bank offering a wide assortment of financial products.\n\n8.BHARTIARTL is the third largest mobile network operator in India and the second largest mobile network operator in the world with over 411.42 million subscribers \n\n9.INR, is the Indian Rupee. \n\n10. BAJFINANCE - a subsidiary of [Bajaj Finserv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bajaj_Finserv), is an Indian Non-Banking Financial Company ([NBFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBFC)). The company deals in [Consumer Finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Finance), SME (Small and Medium-sized Enterprises) and Commercial Lending, and [Wealth Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_Management).\n\nAll these are consumer-based companies and all are quite strong from the little DD I have done on each individually but that can be done later or not at all depending on my mood. Im here to talk about the whole thing instead. \n\nNow India is suffering from social, biological and economic problems and I will break them down one by one:\n\n**Biological**: (namely the Beer Flu): \n\nThere are currently 31 cases of Covid- 19 in India across the country, looking at numbers from countries that are cleaner and have better healthcare systems \u2013 that number should be around 500 and the testing is not being done fast enough or the cases are about to come out very  soon assuming the Indian govt is ahead of the virus and testing kits. India is very dense in the cities, polluted and many areas are proper shitholes (come at me, but it\u2019s true). This is prime infection areas for the virus. Indians lack the idea of personal space \u2013 this is seen by the overcrowded trains with people everywhere on them, the pictures of the roads and other transportation systems. (Don\u2019t call me racist \u2013 its true. Ask a civilised Indian like moi).\n\nThe Healthcare system in India is 6/10 as many doctors leave for the West in hopes of a better quality of life. The healthcare system in India is the most privatised healthcare system and is relatively cheap for Americans. The public system is much more corrupt than the private sector which is quite ironic for the commies reading this.\n\nHealthcare and drugs in India have a large component of their raw materials coming from China \u2013 and the imports from there have decreased. This is going to affect India YUGELY. [https://www.voanews.com/science-health/coronavirus-outbreak/coronavirus-spotlights-india-drug-industrys-reliance-china](https://www.voanews.com/science-health/coronavirus-outbreak/coronavirus-spotlights-india-drug-industrys-reliance-china)\n\nAccording to the [United Nations](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/un.html), in India, about 48 out of every 1,000 newborns die before reaching the age of five. It is one of the [highest ](https://www.unicef.org/publications/files/UNICEF_SOWC_2016.pdf)under-five child mortality rates in South Asia (behind [Afghanistan](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/afghanistan.html) at 91 and Pakistan at 81). In terms of numbers, [India](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/india.html) has the largest share of global under-five deaths at 1.3 million annually.\n\nHowever, India has been able to stand up to the Polio and eradicating it, the swine flu pandemic in 2009 and the later Nipah virus (which ironically came from bats as well.) India has been able to handle these viruses by detecting them early and doing whatever is necessary such as the killing of a million pigs. India has been able to coordinate testing and has tested over 600,000 people at major airports and is currently monitoring 27,000 people near the border of Nepal. \n\nOn the other hand, Indians can be retarded \u2013 homeopathic remedies are going viral over Whatsapp across the country. A couple of weeks ago, the Indian authorities actually recommended homeopathy as a measure. [https://www.sciencealert.com/india-s-government-is-recommending-homeopathy-to-ward-off-the-coronavirus](https://www.sciencealert.com/india-s-government-is-recommending-homeopathy-to-ward-off-the-coronavirus). \n\n( I\u2019m not going to carry on but here\u2019s a link ([https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-51747932](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-51747932)).\n\n**Macro-economic** \u2013 \n\nIndia\u2019s inflation rate is high, currently the 2020 level is 7.59%. ([https://tradingeconomics.com/india/inflation-cpi](https://tradingeconomics.com/india/inflation-cpi))\n\nMuch of it led by food inflation which has been destroying lower middle class and working -class citizen\u2019s buying power. It has reached double digits before and is currently at a rate of 13.63%. ([https://tradingeconomics.com/india/food-inflation](https://tradingeconomics.com/india/food-inflation)).\n\nIt\u2019s CPI is currently 50% higher than it was in 2012 ([https://tradingeconomics.com/india/consumer-price-index-cpi](https://tradingeconomics.com/india/consumer-price-index-cpi)) and has been generally increasing at a rate of 7.6% YoY.\n\nIndia is corrupt from the bottom to the top as I said before and this is the main reason why China was able to advance at a much quicker pace than India was in the last 40 years even though both countries started off in similar positions after wars during the 1940s. India has many laws and regulations in place that have stopped the Indian economy from actively building momentum using FDI and domestic investment. It has relied on a cheap rupee, its education that teaches Indians English at an early age and the large ass population that can be exploited by TNCs and domestic users. The middle class in India is expanding and getting richer \u2013 however this doesn\u2019t help the country when people are highly regulated by both culture and the government \u2013 with high barriers of costs to start a business up in India \u2013 which funnily enough doesn\u2019t apply to larger international players i.e. Coca Cola in Rajasthan. \n\nNow looking at the Indian stock market in general: \n\nThe SENSEX has risen by 114% since Mar 2010 while the SP500 has risen by 152%. Seems reasonable, right? NOO! Look at the fucking inflation. If you put in $1000 in the SENSEX, and after inflation, pulled it out \u2013 you would currently have $1350. If you put it in SPY, you would have $1574. That is a difference by about 17% which is a year\u2019s earnings for the long term investor and is 2 years of SPY growth at 8% YoY. \n\nNow India has had a growth of nearly 200% in GDP since 2010 but its stock market has risen by only 114%. While the US GDP has increased by around 50% and 152%. That shows a difference in both countries\u2019 ideas on the stock market and the difference between a silent administration expanding the stock market through QE and rate cuts, compared to a country that does neither frequently if at all.\n\nCurrently, 10 Year Indian Bonds have a yield of 6.185% which may look inviting but looking at the inflation rates, it might as well be a negative yield compared to the USD. ([https://tradingeconomics.com/india/government-bond-yield](https://tradingeconomics.com/india/government-bond-yield))\n\nIll break down the INDA constituents with their exposure to China as that is going to lead to the most losses in revenue first before hitting the Indian economy and then them lowering guidance with a decrease in revenue and profit for these companies.\n\nReliance \u2013 Reliance was affected during the Sino \u2013 US trade war, it had a decrease of 4.5% in its petrochemical sector exports. That\u2019s not a lot. Like a percent maybe. However, that number will explode as the numbers come in and people start to see the effects of a slowdown worldwide in economic activity \u2013 including India.\n\nReliance is involved in energy, petrochemicals, textiles, natural resources, retail, and telecommunications. All of these except for maybe telecommunications will be massively affected by the corona virus and impending bear market coming to kill all perma-bulls. \n\nTl;dr : all of these companies are going to be hit. I haven\u2019t done the necessary DD but if there is enough demand for DD on all of these companies then I shall answer the people in a 2nd part in due course. \n\nHowever, all these 9 companies make a profit and profit-making companies can use the money (especially finance companies) to start the economy back up again. Loss making companies (more likely in the small cap ETF) will be massively affected by this upcoming shakedown maybe even recession. \n\nSocial:\n\nOoh the big one affecting the economy more than the ETF but wider reading is always better and makes you sound better. Currently the Prime Minister of India is a man named Narenda Modi. (read more: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra\\_Modi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi)).\n\nA BJP politician and supposed Hindu Nationalist according to r/india and muslims on social media. ( don\u2019t attack me because I call him supposed, I don\u2019t really care what you call him \u2013 this is about the Citizen Amendment Bill). The CAB is a new bill that has been passed which removes the chance for Muslim refugees/asylum seekers and immigrants to get citizenship easily while still allowing all other religions. Now this bill fucked shit up across India- riots across the country in Muslim states in the East, fights between Hindu nationalists and Muslim Nationalists across the capital and the police doing nothing. Indians already didn\u2019t care about personal space but this changes it because people are dying, there\u2019s much more contact between people that is very good for the virus as it gets to spread but its not good for the Indians who get it but then again \u2013 kinda deserve it for beating the shit out of their fellow men for no reason except tribalism and religion.\n\nSocial problems also include the caste system: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste\\_system\\_in\\_India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste_system_in_India)\n\nAnd corruption. Now if this was a macroeconomics/politics, I would go in more depth and if you would like me to then comment below telling me to do so and I will post a much more in depth post about the social issues of India along with the DD of those 9 companies. \n\nINDA is currently trading at $30.67 and is currently down 15.71% from market highs.\n\nMy actual thoughts on INDA: I believe it will go down further but it requires puts a few months out for the CV to hit the market. I think the ETF will hit at least a price of $27 in the next few months ( around June to September) unless a vaccine comes out in the next 2 months ( highly unlikely) and I doubt the vaccine can save this market from hitting -20% to -30% ( for all countries not just India).\n\n{Disclaimer: I will be buying puts this week. I was unsure of where India was actually heading until my DD was completed. There are 3 parts I haven\u2019t put in properly: social issues, DD of these companies and the actual extent of the corruption across the country}", "created_utc": 1583628824.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ff4qaa/my_thoughts_on_india_etf_inda/", "is_self": true}
