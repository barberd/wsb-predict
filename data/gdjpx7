Like maybe ever?\n\nTesla is up just shy of 3x where they were last year. They've risen from the mid $300s at the bottom in March to $760 now. They are \"worth\" more than every other auto company combined, yada yada yada. Their CEO is clearly as much of a dip shit as he is a genius. He literally told investors to short his stock, and his cult follower numbnuts pumped the stock up today to a higher level than it was when he sent the tweet. SEC could be breathing down their neck. China tensions clearly hurt them. A lot of people think they have cash issues coming, which may be why Elon sent his tweet. But because in 100 years the electric car market could be 10x the size it is today and if they just maintained their market share they'd be making so much money that makes them worth $150B today. Using any valuation method that is grounded in logic yields them being amongst the most over-valued companies in the world. Most holders of the stock have probably made a shitload of money, and I would think that if it starts to fall, it could tank in a similar fashion as it did in March from $900 to $300\n\nTldr: fuck tesla, how TF can \"meme\" stocks even be a thing when the economy is pretty much in the worst state it's ever been and won't recover for year(s)", "created_utc": 1588624956.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gdjpx7/is_there_a_better_short_out_there_than_tesla_from/", "is_self": true}
