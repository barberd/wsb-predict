Virgin have 3/5 of the float still and aren't disposing of any more of their shares while PE is simultaneously trying to grab a stake in it. They're driving the market cap based on the perceived value of Virgin Galactic's tech not the fundamentals. \n\nIt's not going down because close to nobody is fucking selling the thing. You can't even short the underlying because it's flat out impossible to borrow it. There's probably more rally to come as each PE tries to take as much of a stake in it as they can. So fucking quit it with SPCE being memes. PE guys think its worth something and they're putting their money where their mouths are.", "created_utc": 1581733794, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f432pu/why_isnt_spce_going_down_aka_why_get_out_of_spce/", "is_self": true}
