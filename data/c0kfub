{"id": "c0kfub", "title": "Congressional activity: week of 6/17 to 6/21", "selftext": "Good Friday, and welcome to this installment of Congressional activity and financial markets. The general idea is that the statements and actions of federal legislators can have an effect on broader markets. I try to provide interesting happenings as well as participants. I don't suggest any specific positions: I'd like those to come from consensus in the discussion.\n\nA few things to keep in mind:\n\n- All of this is subject to change at any time (i.e. votes can be delayed, hearings can be canceled, witnesses can be struck). The House and Senate operate under their own rules, and those rules are entirely enforced by the chambers themselves.\n- The House is controlled by Democrats, and the Senate is controlled by Republicans. So if a hearing is happening in the House, it is somewhat safe to assume that it reflect a relatively liberal position. However, the committees have representation by both parties, so the discussion won't be entirely one-sided.\n- In general, recorded votes on the ``floor'' of either chamber are taken the most seriously, followed by votes (or hearings) taken by the full committee, followed by votes (or hearings) by a subcommittee.\n- The Senate is generally taken more seriously than the House, since it moves slower and is less likely to produce legislation. Thus, the legislation it does produce is exceptionally important. A corollary, though, is that the Senate has much less activity in any given week (only 100 members, but the same workload [plus appointments] as the 435-member House).\n- The floor schedule of either chamber is notoriously hard to predict more than a day or two in advance, as it is structured almost entirely by party leadership and can change on the whims of that leadership. Hearings, however, are relatively more stable and scheduled. (In other words, the hearings are much more certain to happen, while the votes can be added or subtracted with much less certainty.)\n- This is not all activity, just activity most likely to be relevant to financial markets. There is also no guarantee this activity has an effect on any individual stock or market. I'm not an expert, and this is not advice. It is the beginning of a discussion.\n\n***\n\nResults from last week:\n\n- NAVI lost 0.50 on Wednesday during student loan hearings\n- TRU and EFX both lost 1.00 on Tuesday during hearings on financial privacy\n\n***\n\nShared activity (across both chambers):\n\nIf you were hungry for the G20 pump in advance of the G20, wait no longer. USTR Lighthizer is the sole witness scheduled for hearings in the Senate (on 6/18, https://www.finance.senate.gov/hearings/the-presidents-2019-trade-policy-agenda-and-the-united-states-mexico-canada-agreement) and the House (on 6/19, https://waysandmeans.house.gov/legislation/hearings/2019-trade-policy-agenda-negotiations-china-japan-eu-and-uk-new-naftausmca-us) on 2019 US trade policy. The USMCA is explicitly mentioned in the title of both hearings; only the House hearings mention China. His sentiment during testimony will probably go a long way towards trying to figure out where we are broadly in discussions. Economic advisor Larry Kudlow recently claimed the US was trying to ``kick some butt'' (actual quote: https://wamu.org/story/19/06/13/trump-turns-trade-talks-into-spectator-sport/). This is coupled with subcommittee hearings in the House on 6/19 on the impact of trade and tax policies in the US (https://financialservices.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=403832). Spoiler alert: that hearing will not be nice, either to trade policy, tax policy, or their projected effects on economic growth, as the subcommittee is run by Democrats.\n\n***\n\nOnly one piece of legislation likely to come up for a vote (with a lot of amendments). The House is likely to take a vote on HR 3055, appropriations for a wide cut of subcommittees (Commerce, Justice, Science, Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, Interior, Environment, Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development). The bill is massive (https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-116hr3055rh/pdf/BILLS-116hr3055rh.pdf), and the accompanying report is even more massive (https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20190617/BILLS-116HR3055-RCP116-18.pdf). If you get bored, you can look through and see if anything sounds actionable.\n\nThe House will hold subcommittee hearings on 6/19 on the state of the 737 MAX: Stakeholder Perspectives (https://transportation.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/the-subcommittee-on-aviation-hearing-on_--status-of-the-boeing-737-max-stakeholder-perspectives). This one is really interesting. Pilots have &lt;not&gt; been kind to the MAX. The Allied Pilots Association recently posted audio recordings of pilots for AAL grilling BA executives on the design of the MAX (https://www.star-telegram.com/news/business/aviation/american-airlines/article230522799.html). And if you were wondering, Allied Pilots Association (the same group), along with Airlines for America, a representative from the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, and Captain Sully are on the witness list. I'd pay careful attention for language that hints at lawsuits, fines, or both. \n\nA potential pairing of interesting hearings on cannabis. The first is subcommittee hearings on the federal approach to opioids on 6/19 (https://oversight.house.gov/legislation/hearings/medical-experts-inadequate-federal-approach-to-opioid-treatment-and-the-need-to). Odds are the committee will blast drug companies, but the hearing also mentions ``the need to expand care,'' which I think might mean talking alternative approaches to pain management. On that same day (6/19), the House will hold full committee hearings on small businesses in the cannabis industry (https://smallbusiness.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=2664). The witness list includes a representative from \"specialty banking\" at First Federal Bank. Remember: this panel is run by Democrats. If they even hint at allowing cannabis companies the ability to bank traditionally (https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2019/jun/02/editorial-let-cannabis-businesses-open-bank-accoun/), it could be a huge one-day boon to cannabis stocks with cheap weeklies.\n\n***\n\nThe Senate will hold full committee hearings on 6/19 on prescription drug prices (https://www.aging.senate.gov/hearings/the-complex-web-of-prescription-drug-prices-part-iii-examining-agency-efforts-to-further-competition-and-increase-affordability). Witnesses include representatives for the FDA and Medicare. One of the witnesses has said in the past that transparent drug pricing is a ``priority'' (https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/cms-kouzoukas-transparency-a-priority-at-agency-takes-as-it-aim-at-drug-prices-other-agenda), and my off-the-cuff take is that it would not do well for drug companies.\n\nThe Senate will hold full committee hearings on 6/19 on FAST reauthorization (https://www.commerce.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/hearings?ID=E3C72252-9733-4C86-A87B-761C5AC0061E). FAST is an infrastructure bill, and spending money on construction is usually thought of as a good thing.\n\nThe Senate will hold subcommittee hearings on 6/20 on the collection of beneficial ownership information (https://www.banking.senate.gov/hearings/outside-perspectives-on-the-collection-of-beneficial-ownership-information). There's the off chance that this will put more regulations and disclosures on the stock ownership of different companies, so we might generally keep an eye out. \n\nThe Senate will hold full committee hearings on 6/20 on geothermal energy development (https://www.energy.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/hearings-and-business-meetings?ID=0D0AF494-18B8-4C0D-A907-14F927B529A0). The witness list is very friendly to renewable energy sources, and it includes the CEO of Fervo energy (which recently got an influx of cash from Bill Gates; https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612200/bill-gates-has-added-a-geothermal-startup-to-his-clean-energy-funds-first-bets/) and a VP of Ormat Technologies (ORA). ORA has been trending up. \n\n***\n\nBonus: the Senate is beginning to schedule hearings about antitrust laws. The first one is scheduled (at least for now) for a month out: 7/23 (https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/07/23/2019/oversight-of-the-enforcement-of-the-antitrust-laws). I'll obviously keep in the loop on a weekly basis, but I wanted to give the heads up that the anti-trust anchor was going to weigh here for a while.", "created_utc": 1560520927, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c0kfub/congressional_activity_week_of_617_to_621/", "is_self": true}
