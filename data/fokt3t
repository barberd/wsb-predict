It takes the biggest shitstorms to close their doors. \n\nAs soon as they open back their doors, boomers will be buying the dip if they haven\u2019t wasted away by then. It will be the first place to open back up in areas and everyone will still be so depressed from getting smothered by \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bs for weeks so the market won\u2019t hit green until a few days after. \n\nThen, Boom we\u2019ll see an oil rally when everyone starts to commute again and they can go anywhere that\u2019s not Waffle House. \n\nFollow the Waffle. The Waffle is the way. \nLoading up on USO calls the day 99% of their stores open back up. \n\nSpy 200p 4/8, USO 11c 7/17 SIRI 4p 4/3, SHO 2.5p 4/17\n\nAlso I tried to learn to use think or swim and couldn\u2019t figure that shit out so I\u2019m going back to RH and trading exclusively on the toilet.
