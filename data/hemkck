I cant remember how many times I've set a stop, deep in the green and it ended up saving my ass from losing everything.\n\nI can't tell you how good it feels to take a nap during market hours knowing that I'll be able to wake up with profit no matter what happens\n\nI went long on ACB this morning and my stop triggered at around +8%, minutes before a big pullback. From there ACB spent the rest of the day slipping all the way down to -1%. Had I pulled some \ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\udd90 retard shit and not set a stop i would've lost all 150% of my gains and ended the day negative.\n\nWatching people in this sub go from up 300% to balls deep in red is making me lose my sanity", "created_utc": 1592944837.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hemkck/the_importance_of_setting_stops/", "is_self": true}
