Here's an excellent [Vanity Fair article](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/06/andrew-caspersen-fraud) on Caspersen's crime, which also has quite a bit of information on his background. \n\n*As a sidenote, I will say that Caspersen lived a life of marked by tragedy: His young fiance was killed in the 9/11 attacks, and his father committed suicide 8 years later in 2009.*\n\nI'm not going to discuss the fraud much here, because we are degenerate options gamblers, after all. But Caspersen was a Harvard-educated lawyer, and a very smart one, who created fake documents to sell to his friends, family, and network about some fake private equity financing deals that would give them quarterly interest payments amounting to 15% per annum. \n\nThe court documents that are publicly available paint some details that most news articles on the case did not explain fully. Specifically, I would like to point you all to [Exhibit D](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.458915.29.5.pdf) in Caspersen's case, which includes testimony from a finance expert who was hired to examine Caspersen's trades on Interactive Brokers and Fidelity. \n\nBy late 2015, Caspersen had about $9 million to trade with. In January 2016, he spent all of this money on ATM SPY options expiring in about a week. He would sell his proceeds on Friday and roll them into more put options expiring the following week. This worked extremely well all throughout January and February. By the end of the trading day on February 11th, his account was worth $112 million, more than enough to repay his friends and family and walk away with tens of millions of dollars for himself. But he refused. He kept going \"all-in\" on SPY puts. By the end of the first week of March, he had lost everything, and by this time, one of his old classmates was clamoring for the $25 million he had loaned to Caspersen from a family foundation he worked for. \n\nThe jig was up. \n\nCaspersen was arrested by the FBI in New York on March 28, 2016, in full view of his wife and family. They were all returning from a family vacation in Florida.", "created_utc": 1590427150.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gqf0ve/the_tale_of_andrew_caspersen_who_gained_and_lost/", "is_self": true}
