The first cases of the 2019-nCov virus might have been as early as November. The headlines didn't start bursting out until late January. The incubation period could be anywhere from 14-30 days according to several scientific journals. In addition to this, it seems like it can go multiple weeks after the incubation period before people start showing serious/critical symptoms. Based on this, I think the 2019-nCov will have been declared a global pandemic some time before March/April. Even if it doesn't spread as much as I expect globally, the cases will probably explode in Asia, especially as workers have to return to work. Now, look at the 70 year historical chart of oil. We are currently at an upper middle price of a pretty volatile graph. I feel like there is no way the oil price is not going further down with the current world situation. I think we will probably see $30-$40, which would be optimistic considering the lows of $10 during the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997. OPEC+ also seems to underestimate the potential consequences of the virus, and they seem very unlikely to make any further cuts. On top of this, the Libyan oil production could potentially resume at some point in the close future. I am personally short AF on oil right now, with a 100% return so far. I am monitoring the market closely, and planning to keep my position till we see the $30s if no surprises occur. Asia in trouble means big trouble for oil. History repeats itself, folks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Also, we have increased our life expectancy tremendously the last 100 years. Humans have been on the planet for over 200,000 years. So, how long have humans been able to stagnate the grim reaper? iish 0.05% of our time on the planet. There will eventually be an epidemic outplaying us, finding a way around all our medicines.", "created_utc": 1581365009, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f1vxwm/change_my_mind_coronavirus_is_a_black_swan_event/", "is_self": true}
