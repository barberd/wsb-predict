{"id": "f1xgdc", "title": "Actual free tendies with $XBIT", "selftext": "Apparently the idiots over at XBIT are doing Dutch oven offer of $30-$33 per share and it\u2019s currently trading at $22, for you fuckwads who can\u2019t do math it\u2019s 36%-50% gains LITERALLY guaranteed based on the final price they determine for the tender offer, cutoff date to take the tender offer is 2/12 and in fidelity you have to purchase by 2/11 to take advantage of the deal, Schwab has a cutoff of today, sorry I got to our internal teams late today and just found out about this, I actually work in investments and currently am in contact with both of our custodian\u2019s internal service teams to make sure I\u2019m not completely retarded, you have a better chance of getting filled if you own 99 shares or less but considering as this is a voluntary action a lot of people will probably forget to do this and a lot of people will most likely get 100% filled, if every single shareholder takes advantage of this offer then you are still guaranteed about 50% of your shares getting bought based on the current market price, for those who don\u2019t know how a Dutch auction works, remember to submit for tender without bid to guarantee some level of filling because if you bid at $33 and the final price is $32 you are fucked out of luck\n\nSauce - https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1626878/000138713120000238/xbit-sctoi_011420.htm\n\nSTEPS FOR HOW TO DO THIS INSTEAD OF RESPONDING TO EVERY COMMENT -\n\n1. Contact your broker to determine when their cutoff date is for the transaction.\n2. Buy as many shares as you want (more likely to get 100% bought back at 30-33 if you have 99 since they will fill the odd lots first if literally every share holder takes advantage of this as XBIT set their limit to 420mill worth of shares bought back in this offer, with 40.9mill shares outstanding * 22 per share currently = total market cap ~900mill, )\n3. Submit for tender without bid to guarantee at least 46% (420mill/900mill) of your shares get bought back at 30-33\n4.
