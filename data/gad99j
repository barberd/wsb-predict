As we all know oil has been bent over the barrel and shown the 50 states multiple times, and everyone here and their wife's boyfriend is trying to play it. That being said we are due for a nice little reversal, and whether the tree huggers like it or not, oil will be here to stay even with the progression of EVs and such. It's used in many different materials in addition to being the main energy source for transportation, at least in the near term. USO/oil ETFs are a stupid way to play oil if you know anything about contango, etc. so the only relatively safe way to play it is using an ETF that tracks oil and energy companies, like XLE. If you check my magic crayons, this ETF has a nice gap to fill and is trending to the upside, just broke some major resistance at the 35-36 level, and is forming the bullish autistic W sign (also known as a cup and handle). \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x67m0uiggsv41.png?width=1616&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c60c0edc39d74622a29f3a2dc8c7f6aae3b093e\n\nWhen fundamentals and technicals come together, we make a tendie baby with some sweet sauce. The play is essentially a split strike synthetic long if you have the cash to cover the short puts, if not then the calls will likely print too. The short put side is because we don't mind owning an ETF with good companies yielding 6% if this gets crushed, since we can just hold until it rebounds again and sell for a profit. It also helps us cover the cost to buy the calls, by continuously rolling short puts around the major support/resistance line that will likely hold. The call at 38.21 (adjusted) puts it right in the sweet spot of the gap that hopefully will get blown through to the next point of around 42 where it gapped down.
