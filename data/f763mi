If modders need my proof of position, its right here: https://imgur.com/iXoPf8V\n\nI read all the submission guidelines and literally don't think im breaking any of them. \n\n------------\n\n\nAfter buying a subprime card lender, Ally dropped the most in over six years. The bullish signal here is due to the massive drop in stock price that is bound to correct itself, in both ST and LT.\n\nAlly Financial is the largest auto lender in the country. They make hella money on interest payments and have a healthy balance sheet. This acquisition and entry to the credit card business is not only to diversify, but it is highly risk-on for the lender. The consumer credit market is super healthy right now, everyone is lending and people are spending because for the present moment, the economy is healthy and people want to buy shit. Think about why all you autists are even on WSB. You have disposable income you can just yolo into RH\n\nCash rich credit card issuers raise capital at stupid cheap levels, and have been crushing it in terms of revenue. For comp sake look at synchrony financials 40% growth in the last year alone in stock. Also look at discover, amex, and visa.\n\nI'm not here saying Ally will moon, but it will definitely correct itself soon. Buy now for strong upside potential. seriously.", "created_utc": 1582260838, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f763mi/reposted_with_my_positions_dd_on_ally_for_all_you/", "is_self": true}
