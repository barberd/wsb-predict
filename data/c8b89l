{"id": "c8b89l", "title": "Short the VIX (no, really).", "selftext": "Hello my little Auties.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm going to explain a trade that you've all probably heard of since it's a giant finance meme.  The thing is, it's a great trade that actually works under the right circumstances.  I believe that right now the circumstances are right.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**sHoRt ThE vIx**.  Yes that's the trade.  In general I think we can all agree that the market has a bias to go up, and on the way up the market is slow and orderly... bulls take the stairs, bears take the window is the idea.  Anyways, when the market isn't losing it's shit, the VIX will remain chill.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thing about shorting the VIX is that depending on how you do it, you make money as long as the market doesn't sell-off, regardless of whether or not the VIX actually goes down.  See options below.  **The last one is the best one in my opinion**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese are your options to short.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.  **Options on VIX directly**.  Don't do this, it's for either hedge fund geniuses or autistic idiots - I'm going to guess you're the latter.\n2. **Options or spreads on volatility ETFs**.  Don't  ever be long these options.  They're priced to reflect the fact these products go down.  Maybe bear credit spreads, but I personally like the next option better.\n3. **Short shares of vol-ETFs**.  This is the winner, I'll explain why.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll explain how trade 3 works.  Your options are VXX, UVXY, TVIX.  Margin requirements from brokers I use are insane for UVXY and TVIX and borrowing costs are higher.  I just directly short VXX.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk so how do these things work?  Basically they buy month 2 volatility futures and sell month 1.  Well, the volatility curve is GENERALLY always in contango (like 90%+ of the time), which means is slopes up and to the right, which means the near term months are cheaper than the outer months.  So if the market isn't wigging out, VXX will constantly buy M2 and sell M1.  Which means it constantly loses money, again, as long as the market isn't freaking out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't even care all that much about macro news, I like to look at price action.  If the market is back in drift up mode there is a lot of premium left to be pulled out of vols.  Just check  [http://vixcentral.com/](http://vixcentral.com/)  \\- M1-M2 contango is almost 9% right now.  That means VXX is going down unless the market sells off.  Even if the market is down (like today), VXX is still going to go down in general.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWatch your positions and cover your short if M1 ever goes above M2, or take profit when you want.  Don't get greedy, this one can blow up.  The longer you're in the trade though, the better it is - if you can build up a 40% gain over time (2017 lolz), spikes do less to you, borrowing costs are lower, and margin use is smaller and smaller because it's all based on the short market value of your position.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:  stop losing money and make the ultimate theta trade - short VXX.  Check**  [**http://vixcentral.com/**](http://vixcentral.com/)  **and if the line goes up and to the right, sell some VXX short.  Cover if the first dot on the line goes above the second, or whenever you want to take profit.**", "created_utc": 1562084465, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c8b89l/short_the_vix_no_really/", "is_self": true}
