{"id": "fhef6o", "title": "TAXES: Underpayment Penalties", "selftext": "My [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fgfr97/taxes_how_to_treat_those_sweet_tendie_gains/) was a simple summation of how gains/losses are treated from a tax perspective. This post will dive deeper into one of the more important aspects, underpayment penalties and how to avoid them.\n\n*This is intended to help clarify some things and ultimately help everyone make more informed decisions to prevent any tax time surprises. You should seek out a local CPA for further guidance. Look for a real CPA and avoid places like H&R Block or Jackson Hewitt, those people took a few week course and don't posses the knowledge and years of training needed to handle your absolute biggest annual expense. Again, every situation is different and there are tons of exceptions but the examples below are overly simplistic and will work for most. The information below is just federal guidance, each state handles differently.*\n\n**What is an underpayment?**\n\nAt the end of the year, when you go to file, you realize that not enough was taken out of your paycheck to cover the taxes owed on your gains. This is entirely preventable and at the very least, you should avoid the penalty associated.\n\n**HOW TO AVOID THE PENALTY**\n\n1. Owe less than $1,000. - This means the total check you have to cut to the IRS at tax time is <$1,000.\n2. Throughout the year, pay either 90% of the tax for the current year or 100% of the tax shown on the return for the prior year, whichever is smaller. - **This is most important and can save you** so let's take a look.\n\n* Example: You make $50k from your salary and had $95k in short term gains this year. Last year, you only had your $50k salary. Your total tax owed this year comes to $23,000 and the total  tax you owed last year was $8k. You didn't expect to make an additional $95k so your employer only withheld $9k from your salary.\n   * The two amounts used to figure out whether or not you will pay a penalty are $8k (100% of the tax shown on the return for the prior year) and $20,700 (90% X The total tax owed this current year. The $8k is smaller so that is used and you already paid $9k through your employer which means you are 100% clear from a penalty standpoint. Now, you just avoided the penalty; however, you have to cut a check for $14k ($23k - $9k.)\n   * Using the same example above, let's assume your employer only withheld $7k for taxes. The two numbers used to calculate if a penalty applies are unchanged, $8k and $20,700. Since $8k is less we use that. Remember, your employer only withheld $7k so now you are subject to penalty because you paid less than 100% of the tax shown on the prior year return. The penalty amount changes annually but for 2019 was 6%. In addition to the $16k ($23k - $7k) check you must cut, a penalty of $960 ($16k x 6%) would be assessed.\n\n**How to play it smart**\n\n* If you are having a breakout year, take a look at your total tax owed from last year and make certain you are paying 100% of that amount. Many employers allow you to contribute additional amounts to the IRS via your regular paycheck but if not, here is the link to [make estimated payments](https://www.irs.gov/payments).\n* Even if you make certain you have paid 100% of prior years' tax, that only clears you from a penalty standpoint. You still need to write a very large check for the additional taxes. Be smart, set aside a portion of gains in a separate account to use for tax time.\n* Now, the IRS does allow exceptions to penalties for 2 reasons but **DO NOT** rely on these:\n\n1. You didn't make a required payment because of a casualty event, disaster, or other unusual circumstance and it would be inequitable to impose the penalty. (should be interesting with beer flu)\n2. You retired (after reaching age 62) or became disabled during the tax year or in the preceding tax year for which you should have made estimated payments, and the underpayment was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect.\n\n**KEY TAKEAWAY:**\n\n**Plan ahead. You shouldn't just focus on avoiding the penalty but rather making certain you have the ability to pay your full tax burden.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo not think that you closed your account or since you took cash out that you are in the clear. Your brokerage reports your gains to the IRS. I recognize that there are some people on this sub that need to hear this.
