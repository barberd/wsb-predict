{"id": "g1d7ol", "title": "Dow Jones Diamond ETF", "selftext": "EDIT:  In the original post I said resistance for P and F is at 254.  I looked at it again and it is 256.  Point being 254 is the average between 252 on the Fibs and 256 on P and F.   TA is an inexact art so I'd say close out your trades if long when DIA approaches that range.\n\nWell the long awaited bank earnings week is here and JPM led the charge.  Despite horrific earnings losses the stock and market all went up in general.  The market only seems to care about credit and in this context the credit markets have the 99% backstop of the Federal Reserve.\n\nThis seems to set the tone for the near term - e.g. next 5-8 trading days as generally positive.\n\nThe DIA dow jones diamond Etf has closed above the 50% retracement level at 239 with additional resistance at 252.  Lower volume is a bit worrying for bulls but given that JPOW is pumping his favorite constituents - the financials - the trend seems to be up for now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0aqg8c1ncus41.png?width=1404&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7a5b5c075ed0cdb444f5af0af3b743285248958\n\nAs for the Point and figure daily chart the red line indicates resistance while the blue is support.  The way you read this is to see where the lines end and then look parallel to the price targets.  Here we can see that the P and F chart is calling for DIA resistance at 256 which aligns closely with the regular candlestick chart above.   In general the further you get away from the support and resistance line in P and F the less accurate they become.  This is why I am not paying attention to the support line which is ALLL the way down at 192.  On the other hand today's price action is close to the resistance line.  (the reason why there is an X above the 239.56 indicates there was an intraday high).\n\nThe 2x top breakout is a very commonly seen indicator in P and F and is akin to the inverse head and shoulders in the traditional bar or line graphs.  That is to say they are not very reliable by themselves and before long you will see them everywhere - this is why it is important to analyze things along with other things.  In order this would be volume and in the current scenario - just how fast is JPOW printing. As 2008-2009 proved, the financials are the Fed's top (some would say only) priority b/c of their duty to helping their Wall Street friends.\n\n[TLDR: DIA May 252c](https://preview.redd.it/y9245tuddus41.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=38ca988656f0163ec39f9c0d60e9d98dd324881a)", "created_utc": 1586896059.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1d7ol/dow_jones_diamond_etf/", "is_self": true}
