Especially the steep drop from IG to HY.  The past decade's buoyance is due to equity buybacks but now with those cancelled as well as dividends then the cliff is steeper.  The Fed is also prevented (for the moment) in buying non-IG bonds per its mandate.  That may change but requires a Congressional amendment.  \n\nCorporate office REITS like Vornado and SL Green which are otherwise good companies have been punished \n\nTLDR: Buy put spreads (b/c IV is high)  on companies with ratios >8 - the higher the better.
