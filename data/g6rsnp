{"id": "g6rsnp", "title": "DD for Y'all", "selftext": "Alrighty retards, growing complaints over a lack of DD in this sub has made me determined to make WSB good enough again. Buncha half senders over at r/Investing don't want it cuz they can't get their PP hard so you guys will benefit from my work instead of them. Y'all said you want investing ideas so I will list tickers and reasons to pursue.\n\nHere's the deal, while Covid-19 has laid absolute pipe to most of the market, there are a few industries that will benefit from it:\n\n**Retail/Wholesale:**\n\nTickers: BJ, WMT, KR, COST, HD, AMZN\n\nShopping has now become a weighing of risk for consumers. They want to make one stop to get their groceries, razors, and paint so they can pretend to be *White People Renovating Houses*. Foot traffic in these stores has either remained constant or slightly increased, however, their online traffic has significantly increased. For grocery, the margins for online are quite low, but it drives the sale of other items and keeps cash flow that generates value.\n\nKR: Consistently beats EPS estimates. [Here](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/kr/earnings). Likely to do it again.\n\nBJs is an aging retailer that will eventually eat shit but for now its going to do well, people will flock to companies that are beating on earnings so it is a safe(r) bet.\n\nWMT has seen a pretty significant price increase as of late, so if you are looking for those huge returns you are not going to find them there, but they are a safe growth bet in the long term and really showed their ability to handle crisis with the way they handled everything.\n\nHD is definitely one of the best stocks to buy right now IMO. They are down quite a bit from the beginning of the virus, but are likely to beat on earnings and have seen an increase in traffic. This is likely due to the DIY Karens of the world who have decided to put on their safety glasses and tool belts and redo their bathrooms, paint every room that has a color on its walls and tell their husbands to go out and make their lawn the best it can be this year because they can't stand to see their family sit around and not do something to benefit them in return for all their dish washing. We salute you Karen and that new $500 Kenmore from Home Depot will definitely not take just as much time for you to load and unload you gullible sloot.\n\nAMZN: Kinda a tricky one to be honest, while they are obviously doing well from the fact that when it comes to buying just about anything online and having your wife's boyfriend put it on your front doorstep, it was likely he drives a navy van with a weird smile on the side. But there are other aspects to look at too, the death of the USPS appears imminent, with Trump poised to do what appears to be nothing to protect them from ceasing to exist. There's a window of opportunity for them. But, IMO I would back off for now because their price has already mooned, outpacing their growth and making it overbought and overvalued. Set an alert at $1,900-2,000 and buy then. Just keep in the back of your mind that they are likely to face their biggest challenge of their existence in the next few years, which could either be that  a) they become too big and have a tough time getting any bigger. Or b) the government does what its supposed to and steps in, saying they've let the monopoly go on long enough and that AMZN needs to be broken up.\n\nOverall, consumers are still shopping for what they need, and these stores have it. Trade earnings swings, or find a good price and lock it for a few years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Food Service:**\n\nYou've probably seen this yourself if you've pulled up to Starbucks to get anally pounded by the skinny white hippy dude of choice, or if you went to McDonald's just to know what it feels like to not eat at home. Well, you're just one of many who have visited a fast food place and waited an insanely long time just to get a cup that you can pour out and put your booze in so no one knows you're getting hammered 30 minutes after waking up at 11:30. While business at some of these places hasn't necessarily increased, just moved to the drive through, some places that don't normally see a lot of window traffic have picked up. These companies are likely to do well over the next year or so.\n\nSBUX, MCD, CMG, WEN, DPZ, YUM, GRUB, UBER,\n\nSBUX: will run up and beat on earnings, then is likely to sell off a bit. Trade it how you want but they have a bright future ahead either way.\n\nMCD/WEN: have shown the ability to innovate and grow despite size, GrubHub delivery and packed drive thrus they are another that will be benefiting from all the unlucky husbands who have useless wives that can't cook for shit.\n\nDPZ: rallied hard the past few weeks, solid future potential, wait for the right price.\n\nYUM: For the families who have bumshit wives that can't cook or are of a certain race in which their dad might\n\nGRUB/UBER: both of these have seen tremendous popularity while everyone is stuck indoors, now that the anxiety has worn off and people are comfortable again, but still not able to go and eat out these have been the choice. Buy all you can at a comfortable price, these are here to stay.\n\nTo wrap up, I'll waste my time and try to tell you this: don't be an idiot. Take the 10% and move on. Don't YOLO AAL calls, don't try to buy a friggin oil tanker, don't buy AMZN puts. Just relax, stick to what you know will happen, and aim to get out of this with a profit of any size. Oh yeah, and buy $SPY 4/24 $300c because they gonna moon.", "created_utc": 1587665882.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6rsnp/dd_for_yall/", "is_self": true}
