MDT is proof of how retarded the market is right now being at 52 week lows while it's products are more and more in demand. They are also working with tesla on their ventilators so musk can transfer MDT his retard strength.\n\nWhile it's hard to fight the downward trend. MDT is completely undeserving of it's sell off. In case the possibility of a default is worrying in this climate below is why this won't happen for MDT.\n\n92 Billion dollar marker cap\n\nOnly 24B in debt\n\n11B in Cash\n\n30B in annual revenue\n\nNet yearly interest on debt: 844M\n\nNow let's get into why this company is deserving of a good pumping.  Ventilators, you've heard about them consistently every fucking day from the white house, Did you know a single ventilator costs 50k? you heard that right. Now lets break down the numbers, MDT is the number one global supplier of these ventilators, the best expertise, and the best production. Recently they doubled up on production of these ventilators and this is likely just the beginning as they are currently moving to 24/7 production..  From here on out all my numbers are essentially estimates, I will give play devils advocate with my estimates and give what I consider the to be the lower range of possible good outcomes for the company.\n\nThe most recent model, the puritan bennet 980 ventilator currently retails for 54k. Trying to find profit margins on the device is nightmare but we can do some extrapolation based on previous models. The puritan bennet 840 retailed around 10k and obviously a profit is made so the cost has to be less, but looking at the improvements made, I can't see the newer model objectively being worth more than double, coming with only a bigger screen, a battery, and a fail safe system. So that leads me to conclude it costs 20k or less to produce with 20k being an extreme estimate. So with a price of 50k the gross profit margins is, at the low end, 60%. \n\nOkay so that's some good info right off the bat, lets delve even deeper. Current estimates for worldwide ventilator demand is extreme with some US estimates being upwards of us being short on 800,000, with other countries falling in line as well. Seeing as how this seems to be a wake up call for governments about preparedness, I expect demand to continue after the virus as well so in terms of long term outlook, it shouldn't be a stretch to say the growth of this sector continues. If MDT is only producing 200,000 worldwide this year (a low ball considering Tesla is saying they can start with 1k a week (52k a year) starting in a week from a company with no in place infrastructure or experience, So 4x that amount is definitely not a stretch) would add nearly 6B to yearly gross profit a 30% increase. \n\nReasons why this is a lowball:\n\nLikely less than 20k to manufacture\n\ngovernments pay much higher than market value (ie spending $50 per hammer)\n\nassuming only 4x Tesla production, a company with no in place infrastructure or knowledge of the field.\n\nSo why MDT and not other companies in the field? Value proposition. I'm just going to paste a spreadsheet below with info on other companies in the field and you tell me what looks like the best buy, only JNJ looks anything close to the same value proposition.\n\n [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mApsQKE6eeaTaR6aKNHFslFQ\\_VSlGe5RgIcgKpoPyX8/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mApsQKE6eeaTaR6aKNHFslFQ_VSlGe5RgIcgKpoPyX8/edit#gid=0) \n\nNow on to entry/exit points and that good good TA. In this environment I feel daily charts are less insightful than 4 hour charts as the initial drop is essentially an outlier and fucks with a lot of TA that uses averages. On the chart below I'm using the ichimoku cloud and volume confirmations to decide my entrance. \n\n[https://imgur.com/UyBTVNF](https://imgur.com/UyBTVNF)\n\nMy entry point will be when the tenken crosses the kijun and the price breaks above both with large volume and closes above on two 4 hour candles or if the first break is just too convincing. If that sounds like gibberish it is, you wouldn't have a bad entry now if you believe in the DD, in fact it would be better I'd just prefer to trade off confirmations for the confidence in this market. My exit point is 500% profit no more no less. Keep in mind this is a play against the current momentum and the company is currently sitting at 2017 lows which relative to the market is still high. My numbers are all estimates which is why I tried to low ball how much profit they'll have but I could still be wrong on everything. Which is why I'm using TA for confirmation. if you want to know if I'm in the play yet just reply to this thread and ask again (please do, even though I've been researching a few hours I'll probably forget anyway).\n\nTldr; MDT 5/15 100c 0.40 each at close.\n\nEdit: put it on my alarm to check the play I'll edit this in the morning when I hop in good luck also positions gonna be slightly different. Buy half my positions in 5/15 calls tommroow then half in June calls once the jobs report hopefully makes them a little cheaper for the earnings play", "created_utc": 1585019936.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnxxpy/mdt_the_hidden_beer_virus_gem/", "is_self": true}
