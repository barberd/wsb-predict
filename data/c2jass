And I saw people talking about $KERN.\n\nI never heard of it, so I look it up on Robinhood and it was halted after jumping a few dollars around 12:30. I saw it was a brand new stock formed after the merger of MTech Corp and MJ Freeway.\n\nTrending on stocktwits? Check\nHalted 10 mins after open? Check\n\nSo I threw $250 in for a few quick tendies for lunch break.\n\nI\u2019m up a couple hundred bucks right now and I\u2019m wondering if I should sell or not.\n\nIt\u2019s not trending on stock twits anymore so idk what to do.", "created_utc": 1560962235, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c2jass/any_of_you_autists_know_anything_about_kern/", "is_self": true}
