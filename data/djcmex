{"id": "djcmex", "title": "Why understanding TVIX is unimportant", "selftext": "So apparently now TVIX is one of the most traded things or something.\n\nSome say that you need to understand what you are investing in before you invest. I say you need to make money off your investments.\n\nFor example, I can understand today's banks but if I only make 1% interest per year, I'm not going to \"invest\".\n\nETFs/ETNs such as TVIX, on the other hand, are simple. Green good, red bad. Put money in when chart go red, take money out when chart go green. Simple. Trading on the stock market is like a traffic light.\n\nHowever, it's not like I understand where I'm putting my money. But that strays from the point because it would take TIME to learn how that stuff actually works.\n\nYou see, in life you must learn how to balance your time. Why spend 15 minutes reading up on market data when you could be absorbing solid personal finance advice on supportive communities such as r/wallstreetbets? Exactly, you tell me.\n\nUnderstanding investments is a thing of the past. 1% and 2% gains is a thing of the past. It is time to take action on the future.\n\nWhat do I mean by this? Well, one way to start would be by restraining from diversifying your portfolio. That\u2019s what the ETFs and ETNs are supposed to do for you or something.\n\nThis way, if the one thing you have put your entire portfolio into goes up, it is easier to sell without getting a sore finger from closing out all of your positions. You may trade \u201ccommission-free\u201d but I bet your broker doesn\u2019t include free ice packs for sore fingers.\n\nAnother starting step would be to never hold a share for more than a few hours, if that. This way, you won\u2019t have to strenuously check it every two seconds and watch it bounce all over the walls in the pre market and after hours.\n\nI would also recommend something that I like to call the \u201cguaranteed win\u201d strategy for you option traders. I do calls in my real money account and puts in my paper-trading account, or vice-versa. This way, no matter which way the chart goes, I can say I had an account that made X amount of dollars at a percent gain of X percent.\n\nYou\u2019re welcome for the free advice/inspiration. I will check the comments when I get back from McDonald\u2019s.", "created_utc": 1571345860, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/djcmex/why_understanding_tvix_is_unimportant/", "is_self": true}
