{"id": "bp18e3", "title": "The trade war could cost households $800.", "selftext": "If tariffs are levied on all imports from China, it will cost GDP $100 billion, employment 360,000 jobs, and each household $800. \n\nThe stat that the trade war would cost households $800 reminds us of the Bankrate survey which asked Americans how they would deal with a $1,000 unexpected expense.\n\n40% stated they would pay the expense with savings. That means the rest of Americans don\u2019t have $1,000 in emergency savings. While tariffs aren\u2019t a new expense like a car repair or an emergency room visit, they will cost households money by making many goods more expensive. The $200 billion tranche of tariffs will have more consumer goods than the previous tranches. The final $325 billion tranche has the most consumer goods. Added expenses will cause consumers to take on more credit card debt, reduce spending, borrow from their friends and family, and take out personal loans.\n\n[Tariff Effect](https://i.imgur.com/awZ7n8d.jpg)\n\n[Can Tariffs Bankrupt Americans?](https://upfina.com/can-tariffs-bankrupt-americans/)", "created_utc": 1557943313, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bp18e3/the_trade_war_could_cost_households_800/", "is_self": true}
