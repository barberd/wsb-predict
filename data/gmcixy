{"id": "gmcixy", "title": "Pagerduty (PD)", "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nSome of you may already be playing pagerduty, however from my perspective, it has gone relatively unnoticed. \n\n**Description**\n\n\"PagerDuty is an American cloud computing company that produces a SaaS incident response platform for IT departments. As of 2018, the company has raised over $170 million in venture funding. It has been recognized by *Forbes* on its \"Cloud 100\" as well as the *USA Today* list for the top small and mid-sized companies for diversity in 2018. The software operates as a standalone service or can be integrated into existing IT systems. Notable customers include GE, Vodafone, Box.com, Clover Network, and American Eagle Outfitters. \"\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PagerDuty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PagerDuty)\n\n**Statistics**\n\nPagerduty currently trades at $24.82 a share and has a market cap of 1.95 billion. It is currently down roughly 58.5% from its all time high of $59.82 back in June of 2019. From its all time low of $12.33 during the Covid-19 crisis it has gone up roughly 101%. Pagerduty has been publicly traded for only a little over a year now. They report earnings on 6/4.\n\n**NEWS**\n\nIn my opinion, this is where things get interesting. On 5/14/20 there was an article published saying that Pagerduty has recently become a part of MITs portfolio. PD is now the third largest holding in MITs portfolio and they have 88,543 shares currently valued at roughly $2.2 mil.\n\n[https://www.gurufocus.com/news/1137065/massachusetts-institute-of-technology-buys-salesforcecom-inc-pagerduty-inc-apollo-global-management-inc-sells-jbg-smith-properties-viomi-technology-co](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/1137065/massachusetts-institute-of-technology-buys-salesforcecom-inc-pagerduty-inc-apollo-global-management-inc-sells-jbg-smith-properties-viomi-technology-co)\n\nIn addition to this, Yale has also made a recent investment in Pagerduty. On 5/13/20, an article was published on Yale\u2019s recent portfolio additions. It stated that Yale has bought 379,070 shares of the stock valued at close to $1 bil.  \n\n[https://www.gurufocus.com/news/1135524/yale-university-buys-spdr-sp-500-vanguard-ftse-developed-markets-slack-technologies-inc-sells-franklin-covey-co-veeva-systems-inc-jbg-smith-properties](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/1135524/yale-university-buys-spdr-sp-500-vanguard-ftse-developed-markets-slack-technologies-inc-sells-franklin-covey-co-veeva-systems-inc-jbg-smith-properties)\n\n**My Take**\n\nWhile I am not that good at technical analysis, I can recognize when a good buying opportunity arises. These recent purchases by MIT and Yale may be indicating that Pagerduty has bottomed out and will be rising more in the near future. Pagerduty has also likely benefitted from the Coronavirus panic as they are involved in the cloud/IT fields. With earnings coming up and the stock currently being down, this provides a big opportunity for those looking to either buy calls or shares. I see the price rising considerably in anticipation of earnings as the date comes closer. Currently, 6/19 call options are pretty cheap as well. I recently picked up 6/19 $30c FYI.\n\nPlease go easy on me, this is my first DD post.", "created_utc": 1589843261.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gmcixy/pagerduty_pd/", "is_self": true}
