Buy Pfizer calls. 7/17 38c is my position. \n\nIf you don't read the news you might not know that Trump has shortlisted Pfizer, JNJ, Merck, MRNA, AZN for operation warp speed (NYT article)\n\nPfizer is a great play, they will be releasing Phase 1/2 data by the end of the month and are collaborating with BNTX. \n\nThey are incidentally doing the largest vaccine trial involving 18-80 age group (looking at you INO) and across 3 different markets (Europe, the USA and China). \n\nPfizer are so confident in their vaccine they are outsourcing production of their patented drugs to increase manufacturing capacity for these vaccine candidates. Yes, candidates. They have 4 candidates in trial. \n\nWhile BNTX being the junior partner would potentially get a greater share of the gains, a quick glance at BNTX calls shows really really fucking high IV, whereas Pfizer calls are in the 20s% as I write this.  BNTX options are also manipulated to shit and I know this from personal experience. \n\nAnother reason why Pfizer? Because they are oversold following a Phase 3 drug trial fail at start of week. Irrelevant for our play.\n\nI think we all know by now that pharma pumps hard off good data and thats what we are hoping for. Given Pfizer had a few billion in their market cap wiped off recently I am sure they will use this oppurtunity to retrace back to 38 and potentially beyond (my personal price target is 40+)\n\nThis is a set and forget play. \n\nJune 19 have good liquidity if you are really bullish on them (risk they wont publish data before then?), July is also a good bet along with Septembers. \n\nRecommended: **38c/40c 7/17, or go long on 40c 18/9**\n\nPositions: https://imgur.com/a/uKTQ8B9\n\nAs always this isn't investment advice. Please do your own DD and assess the risks. I evaluated that this is a low risk play compared to other vaccine plays out there!", "created_utc": 1591207372.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gvyy0d/pfizer_pfe_calls_are_warp_speed_for_your_portfolio/", "is_self": true}
