Pretty pathetic. \n\nAmd debuts a server cpu for 4k that outperforms Intel's dual cpu server offering costing 20k by 30% and using 40% less electricity (those percanteges might be switched). \n\nAmd debuts a 15w 8c/16t laptop cpu at a super affordable price point (fastest mobile chip on the market). Comes with an incredible mobile GPU too\n\nDebuts the single best price to performance GPU of all time\n\nDell partnership\n\nApple using their gpu in new Mac pro.\n\nThis is going to the moon.", "created_utc": 1578354890, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/el2q5e/let_me_break_down_ces_for_you_retards/", "is_self": true}
