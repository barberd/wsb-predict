{"id": "bhcm5a", "title": "My Autism - A Personal Story", "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR - I took out a personal loan for 12k. Lost it all. I took out a second personal loan for 20k. Lost it all. I took out a 3rd personal loan for 35k and managed to make back all my money.  Moral of the story, keep borrowing until you get it right. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood afternoon my fellow Autists,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI decided to make a post about the perils of options and stocks. I started options trading last summer while watching MU gains and MU profit porn. I jumped in with about 2.5k (which came from a reimbursement check from work). So rather than pay off my credit cards with it, I'm like, \"Let's see if I can turn this into some big gains!\" Well, I turned it into 5k and was super excited. Queue \"Stormy Weather\" and a substantial loss. Well shit. Here comes another reimbursement check, let's see if I can double down. Queue a shitty earnings report. So I took my losses, transferred what I was supposed to pay my reimbursement checks towards to a 0% interest credit card for 18 months and am currently paying that shit down. I took a break from stocks in general for awhile, until the imfamous December 24th period.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy dad had just given me 300$ for Christmas, and I transferred that and 100$ into my Robinhood account. Decided to buy calls on SPY on the 26th and instantly got 400% gains and was realized it was super easy. I thought to myself, \"Only if I had more money, this could have been substantial!\" So, I was in calls for a bit, riding the trend upward, but was drinking the bear kool-aid, and kept losing money here and there on puts. And finally, I log into my American Express account and see I pre-qualify for a personal loan of up to 15k. Now, at first I'm like, \"That's a stupid idea.\" I've read your warnings, I've seen the loss porn, and all that jazz and thought, \"Nah.\" Well, it pops up a few times, and at this point, I'm making some good moves, but my account is still less than $5,000. I've been playing AMZN when it was swinging between 1600 and 1700, making a double amount here and there, but I wanted more. So finally, I dip my toes into it and sign up for 12k personal loan from AMEX. My goal here was to buy AMZN calls when it was around $1600. I did - and made a few thousand, but my total losses from all time was around 23k. I ended up losing the majority of that personal loan trying to time the top. So I did what any autist does, and kept doubling down on some stuff. I took out another personal loan through Lendingclub for about 20k+1600$ origination fee. After that, I did my riskiest play to date (other than gambling) was buying 25k worth of weekly NFLX 370$ calls and selling them for 31K. That was awesome. But that got me banned from Robinhood due to day trading and not finishing above 25k. (Just prior to this, I had 20k with of IWM puts when it was 158, expiring 2 weeks out. If would have held, they would have been worth 90k+ when it dropped to 151 the following week.) So I was mad at myself for that and wanted to make another big play.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI transfer my money into my etrade account, and while I wait for funds to settle, I'm watching AMZN rise from low 1600s. If I could trade in Robinhood or had my money been settled there, I would have all in'd some weekly AMZN calls. I had to watch it rise to the 1700s and miss out. I wanted revenge. Queue that Monday when SPY rose from 271 to 278 in a single day. I did the autismo thing and bought weekly puts near open when it was 274 and watched 20k turn into 10k in a single day. I wasn't worried - it has to go down eventually right? Nope. So, I sold my puts and my account value turned into about 2k. I now worked on a strategy to earn back my money. After calculating how much I could afford in monthly payments, bills, and what not, I calculated I could take on one more personal loan payment. I wouldn't be as retarded this time, though. I got rejected from a couple of places, but SoFi - bless their retarded souls, decided they would give me a 35k personal loan. Had I not been approved of this personal loan, I would have cut my losses and just accepted my fate of 3 years worth of personal loan payments. A few days later, 35k landed in my account. I paid off some of my other personal loans, through some money into savings, and transferred about 30k in Etrade. I swore off weeklies. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI purchased about 30k worth of $BB stock and JAN 2020 calls prior to their earnings and made about 20k. I sold some for profit on that day, and lost about 10k the next day when it decided to drop. I pulled out about 5k, made some payments, and then tried to play AMZN and NFLX again, and lost about 5k there, but I didn't gamble the whole farm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThree weeks ago, I stumbled on \"I pick stocks and options so you don't have to\", and read through it. I decided to follow u/SoRefreshing on his TWTR play and bought some $36 strike and $41 strike calls for June 21st for a total of 27k. The day before earnings, Monday of this week, my account value sat at 19k and I was down 8k from that play. Earnings came out and I hit a high that day of 52k that day, and ended up around 48k. I sold some for profit, withdrew some money, and let it sit a day. Next day rolled around, I said fuck it, sold  75% of the rest, rolled others out to September, and bought some $FB stock and 5k worth of calls. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, around 2 PM, I decided one more yolo, and through everything (except 15k worth of TWTR Sep calls) into $FB calls. Today, I consider myself lucky. Hope you enjoyed my retardation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis morning, I withdrew about 10k from my account, sold some stuff off, repositioned some things, and now I'm sitting at around 73k in my etrade account. \n\nHere is proof. \n\n[https://i.imgur.com/3qPCIfC.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/3qPCIfC.jpg)", "created_utc": 1556219704, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bhcm5a/my_autism_a_personal_story/", "is_self": true}
