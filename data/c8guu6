{"id": "c8guu6", "title": "[Discussion] First time trading options, noobie question regarding my earnings?", "selftext": "I bought 2 contracts of Tesla calls expiring on 7/5, with a strike price of $232.5, costing $3.15 per contract. My \"Break Even\" price is $235.65.\n\nThis costed me $630 (3.15*200).\n\nMy understanding is that for every dollar Tesla stock rises above $235.65, I profit $200 (because I have 2 contracts). Obviously, anything below $235.65 means I lose $$.\n\nTesla is currently trading at $240. Shouldn't my profit, if I chose to sell, be around $870 for the 2 contracts?\n\nWhen I go to RH, it says my profit so far is $36.\n\nIs this because they don't take into account after-hour changes?\n\nFurthermore, when attempting to sell my contracts, I get the regular \"SELL\" button, along with \"Other Options\", which leads me to a page with a bunch of price points of selling my calls, similar to when I bought them. Any explanation on how this shit works would be appreciated.\n\n\nSorry for the noob questions; first time doing options (hence only 2 contracts).
