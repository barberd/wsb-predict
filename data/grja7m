{"id": "grja7m", "title": "[DD] American Eagle Outfitters", "selftext": "Tl;dr: Profit off of retail reopening enthusiasm, loungewear sales, and summer by buying American Eagle Outfitters ($AEO) ahead of Q1 earnings on 6/3/20. \n\nExpectations are low for AEO, a casual comfort clothing retailer. While this is kind of a \u201cdid AEO lose less than it was expected to lose\u201d situation, AEO was prepared for the crisis. They\u2019ve had a [pandemic response plan](https://www.post-gazette.com/business/money/2020/05/22/retail-reopen-covid-19-coronavirus-regulations-pennsylvania-shoppers-consumer/stories/202005230023) since the SARS outbreak in 2002. It had about 50% of its stores open by the 21st and plans to have [60%](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/08/american-eagle-outfitters-reopens-43-stores-plans.aspx) open by May 31st. As of April, the company had $417 million in cash and cash equivalents, a 400 mil credit line, and zero debt.\n\nReopening is going well according to this WSJ article from [5/21/2020](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/05/21/pandemic-is-changing-every-aspect-shopping-store-layouts-how-jeans-are-folded/?arc404=true): \n\n> Data show a steady increase in foot traffic since malls began reopening this month. An analysis of eight shopping centers that opened May 1, including in Oklahoma, Tennessee and Georgia, shows that it went from a trickle \u2014 about one-fifth the number of shoppers a year earlier \u2014 to a quick acceleration that in some cases exceeded average daily rates a year earlier.\n\n> It\u2019s been a similar story at American Eagle, where shoppers returned cautiously at first, then with more gusto. Sales also are on the rise: Many reopened stores are selling as much merchandise as they were a year ago, according to Jay Schottenstein, the company\u2019s chairman and chief executive.\n\nAEO announced great Q4 earnings and raised guidance on March 3rd, which would have been great if coronavirus wasn\u2019t a thing. Some interesting notes from its Q4 earnings report: 2019 was its fifth straight year of positive comparable sales. It saw \u201cexceptional growth trends in newer markets like Dallas, Houston and Denver\u201d (all of which are fully open). AEO is the market leader in jeans with special interest in their \u201ccurvy\u201d line popular with women who have or want big butts. \n\nThey did not foresee any coronavirus supply chain issues and only 20% of their manufacturing is in China. Among [teens](http://www.pipersandler.com/private/pdf/TSWT_Survey_Fall_2019.pdf), AEO is 1st among girls, 3rd among guys, and 2nd only to Nike overall. \n\nAEO owns Aerie, a lingerie, loungewear and activewear brand that competes. Aerie is cheaper than competitors like Lululemon and Victoria\u2019s Secret, has delivered double-digit growth for [21 consecutive quarters](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/03/17/3-stocks-that-will-make-you-richer-if-you-buy-duri.aspx), and 50% of its sales were digital prior to coronavirus. Swim is a huge category for them and things are opening up just in time for summer. Another retailer, GAP, said among all of its brands they only saw growth in [Athleta](https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-analysis/exclusive-gap-inc-coronavirus-layoffs) in 2019. If you\u2019re into long term holds, lingerie competitors [Nordstrom](https://www.businessinsider.com/nordstrom-will-close-16-stores-list-2020-5) and [Victoria\u2019s Secret](https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/victorias-secret-to-close-a-quarter-of-its-stores/) are both closing shops so Aerie will benefit from increased market share. Aerie also has a genius marketing team and is constantly getting free publicity off of [places like r/pics](https://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/g9oen5/i_know_its_old_news_but_thank_you_to_aerie_for/).\n\nHere\u2019s the google search trends for [American Eagle and Aerie](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2018-04-26%202020-05-26&geo=US&q=%2Fm%2F034zyt,%2Fm%2F012z6pg4,%2Fm%2F0bcwlr,Abercrombie) over the last two years. I threw in Lululemon and Abercrombie for comparison. The spikes are Black Fridays. Compared to LULU, searches for AEO dipped less in March and accelerated faster afterward. These trends are meant to show that AEO should be valued closer to what it was valued at in Feb, NOT that it should be valued closer to LULU since LULU is significantly more profitable. That said, LULU currently has a 36.64 billion market cap with a 57 P/E while AEO currently has a 1.58 billion market cap with a 8 P/E.\n\nRisks: reopening stores costs coronavirus-protection money. AEO is investing a lot of money into protections like infrared temperature screeners and providing free hand sanitizer and masks. It also has normal retail store problems and, like other retailers, dipped hard in 2019 because of Tariff Man. Only 20% of their manufacturing is in China and they are [continuously reducing this](https://www.just-style.com/news/american-eagle-outfitters-reduces-china-production_id136974.aspx). They also previously reported higher delivery expenses for online orders and I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve sorted that out yet.\n\nI picked up $9c and $10c 6/19 calls. $9c 6/19 has 18,079 open interest. I'm also considering buying shares or selling puts.", "created_utc": 1590584459.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/grja7m/dd_american_eagle_outfitters/", "is_self": true}
