{"id": "e0nc1s", "title": "Call bear spread question", "selftext": "Longtime lurker. On Robinhood, I noticed the following prices for calls on AMD with an expiration on 11/29/2019:\n\n$31 strike: 8.15/share\n$32 strike: 7.13/share\n\nIf I write the $31 strike and purchase the $32 strike, wouldn\u2019t the profit be $2 if AMD stays in the money (and up to $102 if the stock price goes below $31), and hence always positive? Or does this kind of arbitrage only work for European options? (Apologies if this post sounds like a textbook. I\u2019ve been studying for a professional exam on options for the past few months)", "created_utc": 1574539848, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e0nc1s/call_bear_spread_question/", "is_self": true}
