But not just for 1 day it drops until it reaches the bottom 10th percentile.\n\nSome of you might be saying. BUT WE HAD A GREEN DAY TODAY. Well history also foretells that every time there\u2019s a 5% or greater drop, the next day is likely to be green, BUT these occurrences mainly occur during BEARISH markets such as COVID drop, financial crises...etc. and according to the graph we have a long way down to go until we reach the 10th percentile bullshsentiment.\n\n\nTLDR: SPY 280p 6/19\n\n[bullishness graph](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/guid/4ED7E5BE-AC2E-11EA-A293-B6191294A097)", "created_utc": 1592011655.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h7xrhm/i_find_good_dd_when_im_trying_to_justify_my_bag/", "is_self": true}
