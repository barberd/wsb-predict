{"id": "f9aucv", "title": "How does any of this work [options]", "selftext": "Maybe an autistic question but everyone here is an autist so whatever. I\u2019m new to options and still confused on a couple of things. I was looking at calls for SPCE (trading at $36.65) and one of the ITM calls had a strike price of $18 and a price per share of $16.15 meaning the break even price is $34.15 which is $2.50 less that what the underlying stock is trading at. Does this mean if I bought this call and immediately executed and sold the stocks I\u2019d make $250 in gains?\n\n[This might help if my wording is confusing ]\n(https://imgur.com/gallery/jGCivqE)", "created_utc": 1582640010, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9aucv/how_does_any_of_this_work_options/", "is_self": true}
