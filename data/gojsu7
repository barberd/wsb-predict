{"id": "gojsu7", "title": "Corning $GLW, Gov Contract Upside", "selftext": "About 2 months ago I posted about $RVP. A needle supplier for the inneviatable vaccine. Stock rallied about 175% or so since then. For every needle, a vial will also be needed. However, there is a problem because there aren't enough vials.\n\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-vaccine-glass-vial-shortage-could-delay-global-rollout-2020-5](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-vaccine-glass-vial-shortage-could-delay-global-rollout-2020-5)\n\nThe obvious implication is that vials will need to be made, and the largest glass players will be the obvious choices for government contracts. More than likely every glass company in the US will get a contract. $GLW was recently approved by the FDA for their new vial. I wouldn't over think this-- all of the major glass players are going to get major contracts, and even then, there will not be enough capacity to meet demand.\n\nMorning star currently has their fair value at 27 and it trades at 21 and change. Their current business has upside, but similar to RVP, when a contract this big drops into their hands, the stock is going to RUN. Below is a market research report about the industry. This is where I found them.\n\n[https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/pharmaceutical-glass-packaging-market](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/pharmaceutical-glass-packaging-market)", "created_utc": 1590155801.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gojsu7/corning_glw_gov_contract_upside/", "is_self": true}
