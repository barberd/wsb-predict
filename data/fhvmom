The average mouth breather here is starting to realize that something is very wrong and this virus may be more than \"just the flu\". Stupid fucking boomers. We are slowly starting to see panic in the suburbs. Our local grocery store, which is the size of a standard walmart, looked like a tornado had rolled through it. Of the \\~24 aisles, 6 food aisles were completely out of stock. Food is tight. The people are hungry and dumb.\n\nThis is a picture of the sold out meat shelves. Shit looks grim but there is hope. To the far right, is the plant based meat section, fully stocked. People would rather eat their leg during the apocalypse than eat this shit.\n\nBYND to the mother fucking ground y'all. 60p 4/17\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2eacxm3v1em41.jpg?width=677&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a5f78ddf0a143ef4c957536a092999f269490e27", "created_utc": 1584082838.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhvmom/true_dd_bynd/", "is_self": true}
