{"id": "fkzu2x", "title": "Autist Charting Basics", "selftext": "Fellow Autists, below is a chart of the SP500 over the last 20 days. To make mad tendies simply follow these two steps:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. If the candles hit either of the bottom red lines (Red Dot #1), buy SPY calls for a 1-7 days out that have a strike price below the top red line. Or go full autist and buy some FDs although I would recommend against this for calls. This underlying price drop should be reflected in both the StochasticFull and RSI graphs below (Red Dots #2 and #3), indicating oversold conditions. If you spank this route out make sure to sell those hot cakes within a day of purchase.\n2. If the candles hit either of the top red lines (Green Dot #4) buy SPY puts for 1-7 days out. Here you can max out on FDs cause let's be real, this shit is getting gayer by the day \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b . The underlying price drop should once again be reflected in both the StochasticFull and RSI graphs below (Green Dots #5 and #6), indicating overbought conditions. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1w3do61xlin41.png?width=1398&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ba9b044474a72374726815197da8a19c4129242\n\nTLDR: Don't be a bitch, lube up dem SPY 3/27 200 PUTs tomorrow cause you're going to be bending the market over.
