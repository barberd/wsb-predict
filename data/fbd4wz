{"id": "fbd4wz", "title": "Starting WSB Brokerage Services Inc.", "selftext": "With the amount of normies that have entered this space lately, it seems like a good idea to capitalize on this and start our combined WSB Brokerage Service. Everybody wants to get rich right? Why not help these ambitious souls in their journey to become financially independent? We could offer them our general economics expertise and special stonk ideas and rake in cold hard cash based on commissions baby. Think about it. Not only will you not risk your own money, you will also have the opportunity to sell your worthless MSFT 3/20 $200c to some poor clueless simp. Your wife would maybe start talking to you once you start developing your communication skills by talking to normal everyday people. Even better, once we get some traction we could hire all the nice female assistants over at Goldman and Schwab. This literally cannot go tits up.", "created_utc": 1582986052, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbd4wz/starting_wsb_brokerage_services_inc/", "is_self": true}
