You do not need to be in the market.\n\nFDA approved drug of course price will drop after news.  \nLook at the call options for oct  \nLook at another drug being approved in November.  \nLook at the price action today  \nSellers are just about done.  \n2.20 tomorrow is a good number. I can promise you if you are into this under 3 you will not lose any money.  \nMay take months but you will be fine. All of these negative comments are just dumpers trying to get back in cheaper.  \nPut your sales at 4 or 5.00  \nDon\u2019t listen to the nay sayers.  \nThey want your cheap shares.", "created_utc": 1566501771, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cu28pu/nbrv/", "is_self": true}
