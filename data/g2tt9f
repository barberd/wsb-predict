But this beautiful savant has me convinced.\n\nStart at 9:00: https://youtu.be/OHv8u07nrJI\n\nFor those of you who\u2019d rather skim.\n\n1. The Fed is purchassing assets from the banks and they are stuck with liabilities. This forces them to tighten up lending standards (like JP Morgan-Chase announced recently) resulting in less credit and spending in the economy.\n\n2. Less spending, plus the the recession and low oil prices, causes the consumer price index (main inflation measurement) to fall. CPI also correlates with the money multiplier (the amount of times a dollar is spent before it dies by being paid against the principle of a loan.) Dollars dying means deflation.\n\n3. Deflation makes bonds super attractive and makes stonk prices go down because of the relatively stronger dollar.\n\nI think I summarized him right.
