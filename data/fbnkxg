I heard $ZM was dropping and I was tempted to buy a bunch of $ZOOM. I remember it happened during $SNAP robinhood gurus and Fidelity boomers bought the wrong ticker. Had I invested that 20 grand, I would have made close to $200k as the price shot up over 1000%.\n\nWhile writing this, I wanted a source so I pulled the ticker only to find you dumbfucks DID IT AGAIN yesterday! \n\nhttps://time.com/5792310/zoom-zm-stocks-coronavirus/\n\nGuys let\u2019s brain storm. What typo ten bagger is mooning this week? Just tell me what stocks you want to buy in plain English, and I\u2019ll find the ticker you\u2019ll accidentally enter after you did zero DD.
