The best people.*** [Work force](https://imgur.com/a/gWSYLuu)\n\nBefore anything, look at this, [Is this you?](https://media.giphy.com/media/B0dqvPg0rFW0M/giphy.gif)\n\nIf so continue forth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Age of the company, small detail, but an important one,** [Why it matters](https://imgur.com/a/x7NEeW2)\n\nThis company has been around for 25 years or someshit. That means these guys are done fucking around. They have made mistakes in their past with shitty acquisitions, and they are done with that bullshit. Kinda like you and me, we've dated some [bitches](https://media.giphy.com/media/bjvEB94sMn2Qo/giphy.gif), and we've learned not to do that anymore. They have experience of that pain, which is a strength in management. Management is also at that retirement age, they're in their peak, they meet deadlines, control costs, and are looking for that fat ass retirement. Plus inside ownership is one of the highest for KGC in the gold mining industry.\n\n[Management](https://media.giphy.com/media/lOiJqCjiEOcmc/giphy.gif)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Gold Reserves (Gold in the dirt, yet to be mined.)** [Gold Reserves](https://imgur.com/a/40nneEo)\n\nTruly one of the most important measurements, if not the only measurement you should have for a gold miner. \n\n25.5 million oz of gold equals 38.2 billion dollars right now. LIT    \n\n1500 gold oz means KGC makes 500 dollars per ounce profit. Which means KGC has 12 billion dollars of profit under some dirt right fucking now. You could buy KGC for 6 billion dollars...[HELLO](https://gph.is/2HE5OdA)!?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Endgame** [15 year chart](https://imgur.com/a/f7T32xS) \n\nKGC will be bought out, and I believe they are positioning themselves just for that. This goes back to the age thing, management is at retirement age, they are looking to cash out. So that means they will be wearing their best dress, performance is at a very high level, so even if they don't get an offer, the company continues to do well on their earnings. I honestly believe negotiations are already underway, as this company has fantastic mines with gold reserves. Not many gold companies have penetrated the Russian market, this is kinda the clutch geolocation real estate, this is the real estate that makes KGC different. \n\n[KGC will return to glory, management is serious, and will execute.](https://media.giphy.com/media/4ZkAeUWFF9ZGRXE7Ud/giphy.gif)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Target price: 8 to 12 dollars a share**\n\n[You're probably having this reaction.](https://media.giphy.com/media/3oKIPAGZzx2PY1wYjC/giphy.gif)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut the price target is completely feasible. \n\nIn this current environment, it would be impossible for KGC to stay below this price target. I follow the chart on this stock everyday, and there's no fuckin dip. In my opinion, this stock is actively being accumulated, as if the buyout is already underway. GDX and GDXJ have negative days, not this fuckin stock. \n\nPositive, day after fuckin day. I look at the other miners everyday, FSM, GOLD, FNV, they have some decent dips, they will be negative, not KGC. Somethings in the works for this bitch.\n\nIt is starting to become obvious, watch it for the next couple days, you'll see its suspicious. \n\n[Someone is looking at KGC like this.](https://media.giphy.com/media/Qgx12FvGmd5sI/giphy.gif)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **The Trade:** [Get Greedy on this one](https://media.giphy.com/media/xTiN0ye8BRaXVcPMmA/giphy.gif)\n\n**Say you want to allocate 1000 dollars into KGC.**\n\n**Buy 300 dollars worth into November 6 calls**\n\n**Place the other 700 into January 7 calls**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Profit level:** \n\n[Diamond Tier MLM status](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhLLMXMFKTk)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**In conclusion, To be Kinross is to be Gold. To be Gold is to be Kinross.**\n\n [What else do you need?](https://media.giphy.com/media/lgRNj0m1oORfW/giphy.gif)\n\n[Kinross Story](https://youtu.be/EwZv_wEQ7u8)", "created_utc": 1565320347, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cnwhtm/gold_gang_presents_kinross_gold_company_kgc/", "is_self": true}
