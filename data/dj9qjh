Because I think it might be time to get $REAL", "selftext": "If all the research is true and the white woman is undefeated for investing purposes how many of you are playing TheRealReal ($REAL)?\n\nFor those broke ass Robinhooders that are unaware this is a site that lets women sell their used luxury bags/clothes/shoes/etc. Stuff like LV, Gucci, Chanel, and any other brand your favorite Soundcloud rapper sports knockoffs of on their IG Live stream as they hold the money phone made of singles up to their poorly tatted face. \n\nMy gf, a basic white bitch like all the others (kidding, baby, I love you, just need to code switch for the autist sub) just unloaded some of her old stuff on them. They had a real live human come to her place, inspect the goods, send pics to the pricing department, get back estimates in under 15 minutes, then executed the contract on her iPad (fyi- Docusign was the service used). It was very friendly, professional, and honest about potential pricing and splits. Plus, she said since the IPO business has picked up like crazy due to all the extra publicity.\n\nChart action? Well, shortly after the IPO it shot up to around $30, plummeted to $15 as it tried to win a WeWork cosplay contest, and has been steadily climbing back since ($22 and change at time of posting).\n\nBusiness model? A website, consultants like the other basic white bitch that came to my gf's house, shipping, a few B&amp;M showrooms in fancy spots, and back office. They don't pay for any of this shit upfront, and they take splits from 30-45% depending on how much merch the seller moves. Smells like pretty low overhead and high margins. In a good economy I can see more basic bitches shopping there because they can afford a used LV but not a new one, and in a bad economy I can see more of the richer bitches shopping there since their sugar daddy's bonuses are a little smaller. They can do well no matter the weather.\n\nCompetition? Ain't no woman with half a brain buying a used Chanel bag off some Chinese shit seller on EBay. Poshmark is garage sale tier. There are a few other sites like ReBag and Tradesy that do the same thing, but RealReal seems to be the best known and loved brand. In an industry that's all about flaunting brands (you ain't buying that LV purse because it carries your shit better than that discount Kate Spade, you want the brand) having the best brand name matters.\n\nSo, what's up? Anyone like what they see here? Can we continue playing the White Girl of Wall St so we can make enough scratch to buy our own Louis belts?\n\ntl;dr - I have a gf", "created_utc": 1571333643, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dj9qjh/is_the_becky_etf_still_a_thing_because_i_think_it/", "is_self": true}
