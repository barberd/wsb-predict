(and TEVA)", "selftext": "GILD held up today despite the 3% fall of the index. pretty impressive.\n\nremdesivir is becoming the most relevant drug amid the crisis. that's why GILD can easily be $100 in 6 months.\n\nso many people still are not convinced that the virus crisis is real. lots more selling to come. and lots more GILD buyers as it becomes clearer that beer virus is here to stay.\n\nnow, for TEVA. i found a [website](https://www.drugshortagescanada.ca/) showing the drug shortages in canada. and i went thru the drugs that have a shortage and found that TEVA did not experience any (not a single one) shortage related to supply chain issues (compared to Mylan).\n\nThis is very clear proof that TEVA's decision to manufacture most of its drugs in the USA and Canada to be a very good decision amid the beer virus crisis.\n\ngiven TEVA's supply chain is the most stable one among big pharma, they're clearly going to benefit very well from coronavirus.\n\nbuy GILD and TEVA call FDs!!\n\nEDIT: if u saw the link, TEVA has manufacturing distruptions, but not supply shortages. the impt thing here is the supply of API. they might have manufacturing distruptions for a group of drugs and this is due to re-allocation of production to other drugs.", "created_utc": 1583435490.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fe0a2q/go_gild_and_teva/", "is_self": true}
