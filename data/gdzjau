It was by [/u/The\\_Big\\_Short\\_2020](https://www.reddit.com/user/The_Big_Short_2020), a new account that had lost money on Blue Apron and zero previous winning trades. Naturally I was intrigued. He is going long with over 50k in calls into Peloton's earnings call on May 6th. IV is nuts at 190% for options due May 8th. The stock is up 19.7% in the past week. He owns one of their bikes, so you already know he is biased and brainwashed. Peloton is just like a cult. Beckies and sissies paying to ride an overpriced stationary bike. Never go against a cult stock, a lesson Tesla shorts forgot about. So I had to match his retardedness by going long 53k [https://imgur.com/a/my7JJXm](https://imgur.com/a/my7JJXm) . We will see if our cumulative 6 figure investment pays off. The following is the copy past of the his position and following that the DD he posted:\n\n  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gdj3zw/holding\\_over\\_50k\\_of\\_pton\\_calls\\_ahead\\_of\\_earnings/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gdj3zw/holding_over_50k_of_pton_calls_ahead_of_earnings/) \n\nPeloton is growing rapidly - app downloads have grown tenfold. Their stock popped 5 percent when they announced that they had their largest live class (23,000 riders) over a week ago. Their previous largest live class was 19k the day after Thanksgiving.\n\nFYI - I just did a live class and there were 29k riders present; this is 20 percent higher than their previous record which again caused their stock to surge when announced - Pton chose not to announce this. Why? I\u2019m not sure, maybe saving the good news for earnings?\n\nIm also bullish after calling the peloton delivery man who set up my peloton in February. During the phone call I had with him in late March, he said that they are 3x busier than the Christmas season and that he\u2019s never seen demand like this during the two years he\u2019s been with peloton. Though anecdotal, this tells me the lead time (in my area at least) is caused by the unprecedented demand for the bike. Demand during spring is huge because typically this is Peloton\u2019s offseason. If they have christmas like demand for all of 2020, they will destroy their revenue guidance. Let\u2019s also not forget that peloton lowered their revenue guidance during their last earnings call on Feb 5th before this pandemic hit. They will absolutely crush this lowered guidance, that would have never been lowered if they knew Mother Nature was going to give them the most ideal pandemic for their business model.\n\nLastly PTON CEO John Foley said in 2018 that if peloton wanted to turn a profit, they could do so tomorrow. The reason they don\u2019t is because they want to aggressively capture market share which is why they spent nearly all their profit on commercials. Notice anything lately? Peloton hasn\u2019t been airing commercials because there is no need with demand outstripping Manufactuing. This cut in add spending, coupled with unprecedented demand will allow them to reach profitably much sooner - if they announce that they expect to be profitable in 2021 - two years earlier than planned - than this stock will fucking soar.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\nA lot of people see the treadmill cancellation as a negative but I\u2019ll argue it is a positive for two reasons:\n\n1) it is a lot larger and bulkier than the bikes. One treadmill takes the space of two bikes. Also the tread is a lot more time consuming to set up - even though Pton isn\u2019t stepping inside their customers houses, they still set up the equipment outside. Bikes only allow for a greater amount of deliveries at a more efficient rate per delivery.\n\n2) Pton has better margins on their bikes versus their treads.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTDLR: Pton lowered revenue guidance in February - before the pandemic hit. If they had 20/20 vision they would have raised their guidance. Cuts in add spending, coupled with high demand will allow Pton to reach profitability MUCH sooner than originally believed. Their live rider class counts have grown over 20 percent WITHIN THE PAST WEEK. The cancellation of Pton treadmills allow for more deliveries and better margins. The guy who set up my Pton (I live in metro Detroit) told me that demand is Christmas x3 right now which tells me the long lead time is more likely caused by the spike in demand, rather than supply chain issues.", "created_utc": 1588691574.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gdzjau/peloton_earnings_190_iv_6_figure_invested/", "is_self": true}
