Looking at IV for that week and it\u2019s only at 33.71% which is kinda low when comparing it to to this week or weeks prior to earnings (this week IV is 31.27%). Not sure if this is the right play, but I was thinking of buying calls sometime tomorrow and selling before earnings when IV is high. \n\nWhat do y\u2019all think? Stonks only go up? \n\nLMT 7/24 400c", "created_utc": 1593635023.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hji9dd/lmt_calls/", "is_self": true}
