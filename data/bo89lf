{"id": "bo89lf", "title": "$TEVA thoughts and DD", "selftext": "What are you current thoughts around Teva? I feel like the whole allegation is a complete political tactic to get support of people against drug pricing. Looking at TEVA revenues and its sharp decline the past 5 years with generics taking a beating its clearly not reasonable to say they are price fixing and inflating prices by 1,000%. TEVA does a majority of its business in generics so price fixing would have benefited them but the numbers say otherwise. I know debt is an issue but the company is trading at dumpster prices right now and there are other companies with may more debt. They did just under $19bn in revenue last year and they are currently valued at $13bn. New CEO has trimmed its debt by $7bn in 2 years and its completely restructuring. I think its fair to say that now is a great time to pick up shares for cheap before the company really takes off. New product launches AJOVY and AUSTEDO are very promising with pretty good growth metrics currently.", "created_utc": 1557777046, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bo89lf/teva_thoughts_and_dd/", "is_self": true}
