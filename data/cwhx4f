Volume yesterday was 3.379 million. This means nearly every share changed hands once and average volume had been just over 1 million\n\nTilray had a short interest of around 30% \n\nI'm thinking calls are a good option here any opinions?", "created_utc": 1566981029, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cwhx4f/a_little_look_into_fsly_shares/", "is_self": true}
