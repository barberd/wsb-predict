During the August period, the IMX increased to 4.62, up 0.02 or 0.4%, from the previous period.\n\nDuring the August period, TD Ameritrade clients were net buyers overall, and net buyers of equities for the first time in three months. Net buying of equities helped increase the IMX slightly month-over-month, with clients also net buyers of less risky assets, including fixed-income products. Volatility of the S&amp;P 500 spiked during the period, as measured by the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, which reached the mid-20s for the first time since January.\n\nEquity market returns were negative during the period, with the S&amp;P 500 moving lower by 3.3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 2.9%. The Tech sector was particularly volatile, with the Nasdaq Composite lower by 4.4%. Equity markets were influenced by a horde of news during the period. The tariff war with China heated up, with each country announcing plans for further escalation. Consumer confidence posted the lowest number since 2016, and the biggest monthly drop since 2012. For the first time since 2007, the 2-year and 10-year Treasury yield curve inverted, while the 30-year yield also reached the lowest level ever. Among positive news, manufacturing activity, measured by the Chicago PMI, rebounded back to expansionary territory following a six-point jump from July's three-and-a-half year low. Also, consumer prices rose broadly, with core inflation hitting 2.2%.\n\n**Trading**\n\nTD Ameritrade clients seemed to use the volatility during the August IMX period to purchase certain names. Walt Disney Company (DIS) was a net buy after it traded lower by 5% during the period, and it announced a partnership with Target (TGT) to open Disney stores within Target stores. Amazon Inc. (AMZN) traded lower by 8.5% during the period and has fallen for six straight weeks, and was net bought. Microsoft Inc. (MSFT) was a net buy, with the federal government announcing a massive 10-year, $7.6 billion computing contract to a trio of vendors to provide Microsoft office software for the Pentagon. Beyond Meat Inc. (BYND) paused it's upward run during the period, trading lower by over 25% after hitting an all-time high during July, and was a net buy. UBER Technologies Inc. (UBER) reached a new low since its IPO in May as the company continues to come under fire to reclassify drivers as employees instead of freelancers, and was net bought.\n\nAdditional popular names bought include Ford Motor Company (F), BP (BP), and Abbvie Inc. (ABBV).\n\nAlthough they were net buyers, TD Ameritrade clients found some names to sell during the August period. Apple Inc. (AAPL) was net sold for the third month in a row as the company announced plans to start online sales in India. Semiconductor makers Micron Technology Inc. (MU) and Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) were both net sells during the period. Both stocks received analyst upgrades during the period, and were pressured by the tariff tension with China. Corteva Inc. (CTVA), the agricultural input provider that was spun off from Dupont (DD), saw a volatile period after the U.S. Department of Agriculture updated its crop production estimates for the coming harvest, and was net sold. AT&amp;T Inc. (T) was a net sell after the stock reached a 52-week high during the period as the company reached a multi-year content carriage agreement with Starz. Lam Research Corp. (LRCX) beat on earnings and raised their dividend, and was net sold.\n\nAdditional names sold include Wabtec Corp. (WAB), Dupont de Nemours Inc. (DD), and Siri XM Holdings Inc. (SIRI).\n\nInclusion of specific security names in this commentary does not constitute a recommendation from TD Ameritrade to buy, sell, or hold.\n\n**About the IMX**\n\nThe Investor Movement Index, or the IMX, is a proprietary, behavior-based index created by TD Ameritrade designed to indicate the sentiment of individual investors\u2019 portfolios. It measures what investors are actually doing, and how they are actually positioned in the markets.\n\nThe IMX does this by using data including holdings/positions, trading activity, and other data from a sample of our 11 million funded client accounts.\n\nIt\u2019s best to review IMX trends over time, rather than focusing on one month\u2019s score. If a score increases month over month, that likely means that investors are getting more bullish. If a score decreases month over month, that can either mean that investors are becoming bearish, or that they are less bullish than before. There are no defined bullish/bearish thresholds for the index. Scores should be viewed relative to other periods \u2013 the more scores you consider, the more likely you are to see trends that can be compared to other indices or market dynamics.\n\nFor example: If the index decreased from one month to the next after hitting a new high, that may be because investors are taking profits and reducing exposure to the market. But relative to other periods, the score is still high \u2013 indicating that portfolios are still bullish.\n\nWhile the IMX can help provide insight into individual investor behavior, it cannot predict the direction of the market. It provides a snapshot of what individual investors are currently doing within their portfolios. This snapshot, when viewed over time, can be used to suggest a bullish or bearish sentiment on the part of retail investors.\n\n*Source: TD Ameritrade*\n\n-----\n\nLet me know if this is good information and I can share these on a monthly basis when they're updated.
