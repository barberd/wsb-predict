{"id": "btwwlb", "title": "DD: Buy Austrian stocks", "selftext": "First of all Red Bull is pretty kickass and that's an austrian business so the logic is clear enough there...\n\nbut anyway here's the DD: Austria's government just fell apart - the PM just got keked by his righty coalition partners and now everyone's pissed, there's a corruption scandal and basically everything looks FUCKED out there in Vienna. But there's another side to this story, americans; their political atmosphere is actually mostly functioning and they are most definitely not close to civil, the greatest chance is that the Austrians will figure this one out and put in some boring safe prime minister who won't change shit or rock the boat. That's a positive for Austrian equities which have shed ~26% since their recent highs. Somethign something the trade war literally doesn't matter b/c only 3.2% of their trade is with China, the Chinese American trade dispute is irellevant to the question of Austrian stocks..\n\n\nhttps://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/aut/\n\nAlso this website is fantastic if you want to read into a nations economy more.", "created_utc": 1559027156, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/btwwlb/dd_buy_austrian_stocks/", "is_self": true}
