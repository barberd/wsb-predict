We lost a lot of money but I can\u2019t afford to pay $0.65 commissions per option anymore so I\u2019m switching to Robinhood. Is it worth it to pay $5 a month for their level 2 data? Someone asked about that earlier and didn\u2019t get some good responses so please enlighten me. Do you guys have any tips for me?\n\nAlso I switched to bUll gAnG because of FOMC and bOuGhT tHe diP today. My iron condoms are also printing \ud83d\udcb4 \ud83d\udcb5 \ud83e\udd85 \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8", "created_utc": 1572509711, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpkgyk/switching_to_rh_from_tos/", "is_self": true}
