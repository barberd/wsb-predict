{"id": "hgm968", "title": "Toilet Paper Shortage making a comeback", "selftext": "There\u2019s about to be another wave of panic buying shenanigans at the store as cases hit new highs and people forget about how dumb the first panic went and how it was completely useless to buy 1000 rolls of TP. \n\nMy DD isn\u2019t so much a point in direction at a stock, but just a warning that it\u2019s going to happen again. It\u2019s actually starting to happen here and people are mass purchasing again in preparation of another shutdown I\u2019m assuming. Pretty nutty but it is what it is. \n\nPeople are so dumb it\u2019s incredible, they see 3 weeks of headlines consisting of riots instead of COVID taking up the main page and decide that the virus has been eradicated. \n\nMy Plan: Im going to buy puts on SPY into beginning of august as we get closer to July 4th because Americans are too patriotic to not go out and have massive Independence Day orgies (I\u2019ll be joining them) and then we can expect even more cases. The cycle is going to continue all summer until fall when the weather gets cold and people get even sicker cuz that\u2019s how it goes. \n\nProbably going to be buying SPY 280 puts into end of summer, SPY 250 for election time. \n\nMaybe some CLX calls into august too.  \n\nGLD into election time. \n\nAnd yeah that\u2019s about it, wear a mask, be safe. Be ready for another leg down when the next big celebrity catches covid or the NHL & NBA announce a quarter of their team is infected.", "created_utc": 1593228526.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hgm968/toilet_paper_shortage_making_a_comeback/", "is_self": true}
