{"id": "gsrkck", "title": "Dead Horse Poke Investment Strategy", "selftext": "Market recovery is on the rise, SPY broke through the 300USD. The  USA and Europe have opened up, while other countries are just starting  to get hit by the virus big time like Mexico, Nicaragua, Brazil and  Chile for example. As of yesterday there are 40 Million unemployment  claims in the US, and companies are starting to file for bankruptcy.  Bond market is dead, interest are at zero, the Feds and Europe are all  printing money to keep the companies & economy at float. The meaning  is that the dollar itself and the euro will face inflation and debt,  but debt will be just canceled by printing more money as the money that  controls debt is the US dollar --> infinite debt, infinite printing  value. Additional to that there is a huge pressure on Chinese companies  due to fake stocks and overtake of the democratic practices of Hong  Kong. This pressure amounts to again a similar rally compared to the  US-CHINA trade wars.  \n\n\nThe  stock market and the economies are no longer in sync and it could be  that this is the new reality. The market continues to rise and the  economy continues to sink. The market correction can only happen if the  economic sentiment of investors starts to directly be affected , (most  investors who can actually influence the stock market belong to the  middle class or higher in the developed world, they will be not affected  by unemployment as they are mostly white collar workers, own their own  place, have some savings, and can do home office) this means that the  holding companies of investor start to lose profits. The problem is that  profits are reported at the end of the quarter, and as the pandemic  progresses the profit loss gets bigger but it is only reported two or  three quarters after. The market reacts to the profits loss news two to  three months later, it will not react to the current\u00a0 present news of  unemployment. This is the same slow bleed of the financial crisis of  2008, which hit bottom until 2009. A second case can occur to force a  market correction and that is the second wave of corona virus infection,  which would result in the quarantine of the economies and countries  around the world.   \n\n\nThe  only difference from 2008-2009 financial crisis is that this time the  economy was in a good shape or lets say better prepared before the  corona virus hit. The FED, the US Government and the European union had  developed enough tools to fight another crisis. This is the result of  the holding to low interest rates, buying bonds and infinite lending  practices. The current economic situation we face has never existed in  such a way. The outcome can be anything, any one predicting it can might  as well just be blindly gambling on roulette.   \n\n\nSo  I don want to gamble against the FEDS who already said they have enough  power to fight the economic collapse, and I don't want to gamble with  peoples lives hopping that corona virus will come back and collapse the  economy. Therefore i have switched to a new strategy, the \"dead horse  poke\".   \n\n\nYou  see when kids finds a dead horse laying on the street, what do the kids  do? They find the longest stick they can and poke it to check if its  dead. Even after the horse doesn't react from the first poke, that  doesn't stop the rest of the kids to take turns to poke it to verify by  each one of them that the horse is really dead.\u00a0\u00a0 This will happen for  several days as more kids hear about the horse and come see it.  Eventually the smell of the horse is unbearable and the nobody wants to  poke it anymore. When nobody wants to poke it anymore that means the  horse is really dead at that moment. Someone will eventually come and  take the horse away.  \n\n\nIn  such\u00a0 a manner I have adjusted my investment strategy. Originally I was  just waiting and holding for the market to crash and it just didn't, -  missed out on a couple of good opportunities.\u00a0 If the market does crash  whenever it does my actual cash money will have lose intrinsic value due  to inflation. Its a lose-lose situation. If I invest when the market  crashes then I will have to wait several years for a proper ROI.\u00a0\u00a0 Using  the \"dead horse poke\" strategy, I will invest the following way , out  of 100% of my monthly investment capital, I will split it three ways:  10% cash holdings, 40% will be saved for when the stock market makes a  big dip, 50% will be invested immediately in the companies that I  believe have a strong holding in the market, or stocks that I already  own but are at the moment at a buy low margin.  \n\n\nSo  I will be poking at the market every month with 50% investment in the  stocks I own or good buys, increasing my portfolio and my time in the  market. 40% which is saved will keep accumulating over time, and once  everyone had a chance to poke the dead horse\u00a0 and the horse (\"market\")  is declared dead, meaning a crash or dip I will put the entire  accumulative of the 40% into the market. The 10% cash holdings will be  just for liquidity for personal expenses or personal investments, most  likely they will go into calls & puts though.  \n\n\nSafe poking fellow retards.", "created_utc": 1590753163.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gsrkck/dead_horse_poke_investment_strategy/", "is_self": true}
