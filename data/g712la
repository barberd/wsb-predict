WTI went negative for the first time in history Monday, Tuesday we saw crazy swings barely bringing it back positive. \n\nDuring this time their stock had a swing of $.10 in those two days from start to finish. \n\nThey also had their earnings report which surprisingly beat their expected EPS. That\u2019s where their good news ends. They drug in 1 billion in impairment, and has a high debt - equity ratio that is hovering over its head like a storm cloud more than usual in this turbulent time of heavy supply and barely any demand scenario we find ourselves in. Where did a lot of debt come from? From recently bolstering positions to compete with Schlumberger. \n\nThey essentially played their hand right before the beer flu, massing debt at the worst time.\n\nI can\u2019t find any news or anything positive relating to Halliburton anywhere. Their price Target was cut at Cowen, they have massive debt, there is no demand, massive stores and supply issues, they are laying off workers and contractors, going into \u201chibernation\u201d to survive, this pulling any liquidity they can just to weather the storm, but weathering the storm doesn\u2019t make their current problems dissolve.\n\nYet somehow they managed to tag along with the rest of the energy sector in this \u201crally\u201d since Monday and Tuesday\u2019s event. Rising almost 20% in the last two days. Up almost 100% since their March lows.\n\nI understand that the market isn\u2019t acting rationally... but at some point reality has to set in here.\n\nPosition-\n6/19 $2p I\u2019m waiting for the June WTI contracts to go through the hell that Mays did when some window licker out there realizes he doesn\u2019t want to be the last one with contracts he has to pay to get rid of when he already paid to buy them in the first place. If reality still hasn\u2019t set in by mid May I\u2019ll be rolling out my puts to October.", "created_utc": 1587698873.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g712la/lets_talk_halliburton/", "is_self": true}
