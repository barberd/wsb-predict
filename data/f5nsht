{"id": "f5nsht", "title": "$SPCE is potentially fucked", "selftext": "The profits are just insanely low at the moment for SPCE. If we sell 20,000 tickets for $250,000 each, we bring in of 5 Billion dollars. This does not account for all the costs and expenses to fly a customer. \n\nHow long does it take to fly 20,000 customers into space? Well if we do the math, each flight is an hour and 30 minutes. Each flight carries approximately 5 customers. \nAfter each flight, the spaceship will need to be refueled and reset for next flight. If we say Virgin Galactic is able to accomplish 4, hour and thirty minute flights a day...\nThen that means it will take them almost 3 years, flying 365 days a year, to bring in a 5 billion dollar income, before expenses.\n\nHow the hecc they gnna line their pockets of tickets only cost $250,000.\n\nWe need to fucking petition for 500K tickets if we are ever gonna see this shit go to the moon.\n\nThe fucking stock market is probably gonna crash before they fly 100 crusty customers to space.\n\nTLDR: Numbers don't add up to promising profits, AKA we're fucked. It's gonna be 2069 before SPCE makes even the tiniest nut hair of a profit. I hope I'm fucking wrong because jesus christ I sound like a \n\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b", "created_utc": 1582009167, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f5nsht/spce_is_potentially_fucked/", "is_self": true}
