Which one is the best? Let me introduce to you my case for AstraZeneca:\n\nA common gripe with the seemingly rushed approach to getting a vaccine is the efficacy & the safety of the vaccine over an extended period of time. The reason why AstraZeneca's is so favorable, in my eyes, is because the drug had already been under going testing for years.\n\n>>ChAdOx1 has been used to develop investigational vaccines against several pathogens, including a closely related coronavirus that causes Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The scientists quickly adapted the platform to SARS-CoV-2 when the first cases of COVID-19 emerged. \n\n[Source](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/investigational-chadox1-ncov-19-vaccine-protects-monkeys-against-covid-19-pneumonia)\n\nMy understanding of the coronavirus is that a large part of why it defeats people is because of the bodies lack of ability to produce and send oxygen throughout the body. Further, the \"domino\" that triggers all of the debilitating bodily functions is getting pneumonia from the virus. \n\nJust last week, they released a press release indicating that they blasted monkeys with the virus at a scale that is unlikely for a human to be exposed to it. The monkeys began to show symptoms of pneumonia but when they gave the monkeys the ChAdOx1 drug the pneumonia symptoms reverted to symptoms of that of a common cold.\n\nA popular retort that's been going around is this article from [Dr. Hasteltine](https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhaseltine/2020/05/16/did-the-oxford-covid-vaccine-work-in-monkeys-not-really/#543a5b8a3c71). His argument basically boils down to his assumption that the researchers announced this fool proof immunization vaccine. That's not the case.\n\n>The authors present evidence to the effect that, although the vaccine did not protect the animals from infection, **it did moderate the disease.**\n\nFrom the very article Dr. Hasteline wrote^. This was the intention of the researchers. To show to the world that they were able to successfully mitigate the risk of the virus by reducing the risk of pneumonia down to a common cold. Dr. Hasteltine, either with hubris or otherwise, is allowing perfect to be the enemy of good.\n\nThe reason it's being marketed as a vaccine/immunization right now is because if the inherent risk of contracting the coronavirus fell from potentially dieing to just a common cold -- would anyone be afraid of it?\n\n[Further, you can read these tweets from one of the researchers on the team working on the vaccine directly addressing Dr. Hasteltine claims.](https://twitter.com/DrNeeltje/status/1261983331500998656)\n\nSubsequent the release of this information we have seen massive funding coming in from the UK & the US. \n\n[The U.K. gave AstraZeneca $79 million to help with intention to begin administering the drug in September.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/18/coronavirus-astrazeneca-aims-to-distribute-vaccine-in-uk-by-september.html)\n\n[The U.S. gave AstraZeneca **$1.2 billion** to help manufacture doses with the intention to give to its citizens by October](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-gives-astrazeneca-12-billion-to-fund-oxford-university-coronavirus-vaccine-securing-300-million-doses-for-country-from-october-2020-05-21)\n\nYou'll notice that this past week you saw an uptick in Moderna's vaccine, however because of the lack of history of this drug I believe it will face enormous problems trying to bring it to the market from consumer sentiment. Lack of detailed safety tests, etc. \n\nModerna had to go out and try to raise money this past week.\n\nAstraZeneca was literally given billions of dollars by two of the most major governments in the world. It behooves any of us to think that both governments hadn't had their own health deputies review the findings. \n\nWhat this tells me is that this is the most viable option based on the history of the vaccine, compounded by arguably the most renowned university in the world (Oxford), corroborated by 2 massive governments and the health team's behind those, the active mass manufacturing of the drug to meet demand by September, and the hand over fist dollars they're getting in funding of their program.\n\nThe results for AstraZeneca's human trials are expected to be released mid-June. I expect there to be promise in those results.\n\n7/17 52.50c\n\nedit:\n\nForgot to mention, in the years prior to coronavirus AstraZeneca had begun to reshape their business model so that they focus on respiratory related infections/illnesses.
