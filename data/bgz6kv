Peers in the group are currently at a 10.5 rate.  PCG is trying to shift the blame to climate change in their request.\n\n[http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/general.aspx?id=10458](http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/general.aspx?id=10458)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFull request: [http://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M283/K296/283296429.PDF](http://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M283/K296/283296429.PDF)\n\n\"To help attract the necessary capital to meet its customers\u2019 energy needs, PG&amp;E requests\n\na 16 percent rate of return on equity for 2020, which would result in a $1.2 billion increase in its\n\nrevenue requirement. \"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of two things may happen in this binary event, pushing the stock drastically in either direction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. The CPUC (California Publich Utilities Commission) approves the increase, PCG stock soars and is able to pass cost onto customers, price target \\~40$\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. The CPUC rejects the increase leaving PCG with massive forward looking debt (28B in improvements stated by PCG itself + cost of fire claims), PCG will have to raise capital through additional debt or by share delusion. Additionally, they may just start selling assets and bleeding out the company (see Sears) price target \\~10$\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe decision is being tracked here [https://apps.cpuc.ca.gov/apex/f?p=401:56:0::NO:RP,57,RIR:P5\\_PROCEEDING\\_SELECT:A1904015](https://apps.cpuc.ca.gov/apex/f?p=401:56:0::NO:RP,57,RIR:P5_PROCEEDING_SELECT:A1904015)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR:\n\nApproval/Rejection of PCG 60% Cost of Capital request will swing the stock wildly in either direction depending on the California Public Utilities Commission decision.\n\nInvest at your own risk!", "created_utc": 1556135710, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bgz6kv/pcg_dd_binary_coc_decision/", "is_self": true}
