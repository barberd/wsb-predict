{"id": "fbqdmq", "title": "Why Bears Get Fucked on Monday", "selftext": "You think /ES going green on Friday and your puts getting anal raped at the close was just bad timing? Think again!\n\nYou fucking retards...use some DD before you just assume it will just keep going straight down.\n\nDEC \u201818 low to FEB \u201820 high in /ES, draw a fib retracement. Friday only went 4 points below the perfect 50% retracement of the total 1,080 point move in that period so we bounced hard. 4 fucking points. Don\u2019t you think that has some significance. Stocks are all 20-30% off already....that is pricing in a HUGE shitstorm. This market will not immediately go lower, we will gain some back Monday and maybe Tuesday. There will be a short covering panic from people thinking this has to keep going straight down which will fuel the rally. \n\nYour puts will utterly go 80% lower throughout the day while you question your level of retardation.\n\nTLDR: /ES hit 50% Fib retracement so market will rip Monday and your puts will be down 80%. May continue to trend lower by Thurs-Friday but the panic selling is over.", "created_utc": 1583045500, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbqdmq/why_bears_get_fucked_on_monday/", "is_self": true}
