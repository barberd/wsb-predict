I will keep it short and to the point.\n\n(Edit: I will inform you up front that you cannot trade options on this stock)\n\nSCWORX (Ticker symbol WORX) is an advanced software solution management company for health care providers that received an order for 2 million units of corona virus test kits. According the Benzinga: \"The order is valued at **$35 million a week**.\" At their current market capitalization they are valued at **66 million dollars** and trading around 9.90 a share\\*\\*.\\*\\* After looking at their 10K Filing with the SEC when they initially went public their operating expenses for operating in 2018 for the whole year was ONLY about 14.5 million a year. <[https://ir.scworx.com/all-sec-filings/content/0001144204-19-017404/tv511276\\_10k.htm](https://ir.scworx.com/all-sec-filings/content/0001144204-19-017404/tv511276_10k.htm)\\>\n\nDo the math folks.... they are going to be netting close to their whole market capitilization in a matter of two weeks.. This means they are **EXTREMELY UNDERVALUED**.  I think this is a good wave to hop on  wave as this company test new highs.\n\nTLDR: WORX is a company that received an order for 2 million coronavirus test kits. They will be netting an amount more than the companies worth currently in a matter of two weeks...\n\n(Edit 2: Positions I own WORX STOCK and I am NOT a financial advisor just trying to help people make tendies)\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1586873486.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g167mn/worx_is_going_to_see_spce_like_gains/", "is_self": true}
