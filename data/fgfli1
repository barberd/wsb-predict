{"id": "fgfli1", "title": "[DD] EWU", "selftext": "The United Kingdom is about to get destroyed by the coronavirus and oil crises.\n\n1. Bank of England's monetary policy creates a dependence on riskier assets because their monetary policy pushes yields down. A lot of those risky assets are BBB rated bonds or junk bonds in oil debt.\n\n2. Their healthcare system has been known in the past to be easily overburdened. This will be exacerbated by the coronavirus when everyone goes to the hospital to exercise their right to their state-funded guaranteed care for all healthcare.\n\n3. They are in the north so they are colder for a longer period of time. Therefore, the theoretical reduction in infections due to warmer weather will take longer to take effect.\n\n4. EWU has 5% weight in BP, 4% weight in Shell.A, 4% weight in Shell.B (for a total of 13%) which is going to get boned by oil prices.\n\n5. EWU has over 30% in energy and financials in general which is not going to go well for them.\n\nI think they have room to 20 if shit hits the fan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I have 10 contracts 7/17 20p because shorting EWU gives you exposure to both coronavirus AND oil. That means you can double dip those tendies in Szechuan sauce.", "created_utc": 1583854288.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fgfli1/dd_ewu/", "is_self": true}
