{"id": "fokv7t", "title": "history repeats it's self", "selftext": "I'm never serious on this forum because who the fuck would be? but this one's foreal because some dumb-ass's don't realize how screwed we are and how this is literally on track to repeat the great depression so lets just look at how similar of a path we are taking\n\n* **Monumental gains almost unheard of before the down fall.** it's simply an argument of the greatest returns vs the longest bull market. but both the roaring 20's and the recent \"longest bull market in history\" were unprecedented\n* **Over confident market, cheap loans, regular people with little to know stock knowledge jump in(not you, you autistic fucks, even less knowledge), Debt hits an all time high**. not much to say with this one. literally nothing changed. this is word for word hard to tell which market you're talking about...\n* **The big difference argument, bank runs/self destruction, which we've still done just differently.** It's true that we haven't had a bank run(yet)... from the people, big business's on the other hand are running straight to the fed who's acting like money grows on trees. we might not be running to the banks but big business's are running the fed clean. Ever heard of inflation... this idea that feds would bail them out has been here since the dot com bubble, this just shows we haven't changed or learned any fucking lessons.\n* **Leading into a Quick drop out of nowhere.** yes the corona virus was a thing but that's not the only thing this fall is from. People were still traveling when it dropped like a rock, nobody in america was quarantining. while it's clear the beer virus affected the drop it's equally as clear that it was just a factor in an already bloated Market.\n* **Combined with a loss of jobs, which meant decline production and a natural disaster we got royally fucked.** This is where we are at. right here. Just replace the dust-bowl with corona virus and what do you know, sounds pretty similar hunh? losing jobs, declining production, a lack of money, borders closing, money isn't flowing, all the shit is going down.\n* **The future problem, even after the cure**. If people don't have money, they'll have to take it out of the stock market, 401k's and ira's cant stay if your dying of hunger and nowhere to live, if people take it out of the stock market it drops. Just because we cure the beer virus doesn't mean jobs come back,bushiness's are still gonna be down on multiple quarters. inflation is gonna sky rocket with how this fed is acting. WE ARE FUCKED, HOW THE FUCK DO WE FIX THIS...\n* **but at least your trendies print right... haha... ha ... fuck**\n* Spy  200p 5/1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit 1: I can tell I dont know something but I'm not gonna delete. I'll let it ride it's only right.\n\nEdit 2: if this is about the stimulus bill. That won\u2019t fix we still fucked. What\u2019s 1200$ gonna get me? Half a months rent in CA? I thought they cured the virus or something \ud83d\ude02", "created_utc": 1585114114.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fokv7t/history_repeats_its_self/", "is_self": true}
