{"id": "fpqm5m", "title": "Puts are going to get rekt", "selftext": "PDCF what the fuck is PDCF no it's not the name of the chromosome your missing but actually something the blockhead PHD's over at the Fed created in order to Donald Pump this market to infinity and beyond.\n\nPDCF stands for Primary Dealer Credit Facility what is the primary dealer? Good question maybe your not retarded after all...\n\nPrimary dealer are \"counterparties\" of the New York Fed in its implementation of monetary policy, aka banks and other financial institutions which make a trade with the Fed.\n\nYou may have heard that the Federal Reserve earlier this month removed the reserve requirement for banks. Thats right your trusty old bank down the street no longer needs to keep any x% of money on hand for reserves. They can make it rain loans to your boyfriends girlfriend so she can start that primo dildo shop they've always wanted to start together, with everyone of your hard earned dollars and keep 0 of it in the vault.\n\nThe Primary Dealers current have over 1.5 trillion in reserves that they can shell out right now you think there going to keep that cash at the Fed sitting there collecting dust FUCK NO, they're going out the corporate bond market and stock market and swallowing 1.5T worth of equities because why the fuck not? The reason they don't give a fuck is the Fed will now accept those 100c on the dollar as collateral for funny money from the fed with PDCF. What stops the Primary Dealers from buying calls on SPY at 240 and then injecting trillions into the market to reach the strike + some and then when things go south sell the equities to the Fed for a \"90 day\" \"non-recourse\" I might add \"loan.\" The Primary Dealers literally have no incentive not to buy equities right now and then hand them off to the Fed.\n\nNext up nobody is going to go bankrupt. Why because of MMLF: Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility boom boom boom. The Money Market Fund is where businesses and retail investors can make a trade to acquire corporate debt. You buy Mutual Fund A, Mutual Fund A goes out and buys bonds from XYZ corp, XYZ corp issues bonds i.e. debt and wallah the cycle is complete. But wait all of a sudden comes in the Corona boi and suddenly it turns out everyones on the brink of insolvency because we've had 10 years of Fed policy which made money cheap and basically penalized companies for not taking on risk but I digress. So everyone notices that XYZ corp is on the brink of bankruptcy so now nobody wants to give them money for their shit fucking bat soup bonds. As a result bond prices go down interest rates go up and nobody wants to take on the risk plus everyone realizes everyones insolvent so everyone sells their bonds making interest rates rise. So what does the Fed do they make the printer machines go BRRRRRRRRRR lend it to he Money Market Fund and then the Money Market Fund gives the bond as collateral to the Fed allowing all that corporate debt to keep on churning. So guess what Money Market Funds are going to keep buying shit debt and the Fed's going to eat it all up while your puts expire to 0.\n\nPart 2 of nobody is going bankrupt. CPFF: Commercial Paper Funding Facility Basically here XYZ corp is bankrupt and needs to pay bills, they can issue debt and the Fed can make a \"loan\" and buy the debt in the commercial paper market to directly pay their loans. In this case the Fed buys the debt i.e. bonds from XYZ corp and gets to pay down all their debt with 0 revenue coming in. That's right all you SIX put holders bend over and lube up Jerome is going to personally spray money into SIX with a leafblower and there going to live to see another day even if 97% of the worlds population dies from Corona.\n\nLets also not forget a 2 TRILLION TRILLION WITH A T stimulus was just passed where the government is going to wrack up that national debt to helicopter money into every who dick and num nut. Forget Andrew Yang UBI is here motherfuckers and it starts with your dearest politicians shoving 1.2 into your poor fucking asses. Sorry I'm just made that I won't get any stim money since I make way more that 75k a year.\n\nAnywho what does this all mean stoink only go up duh", "created_utc": 1585283218.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpqm5m/puts_are_going_to_get_rekt/", "is_self": true}
