{"id": "fspiai", "title": "Easy New Strat for Suffering Bears", "selftext": "East New Strat for Suffering Bears\n\nFellow Bears, Buy Long-dated Put Credit Spreads. Puts are considered bearish, so don\u2019t worry. You won\u2019t be a gay bull after this. \n\nSo I\u2019ve noticed all you bears out here autistically losing all of your money. \n\nDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve also been losing money on FDs, but I know options are essentially a gamble, especially weeklies.\n\nIf you are employed \u2014 even just part time at Wendy\u2019s \u2014 you\u2019ll all be getting a $1200 stim check courtesy of JPow\u2019s retarded money printer. You can use this money as collateral for your credit spreads. \n\nListen you autists, know it is time to be sensible, fuck playing naked options (~~only with your mom~~) Even selling naked options is risky as hell. One of the most effective Theta Gang strategies is the put credit spread. Sell a put closer to the money, buy a put further OTM to cover your ass. \n\nThere is a defined amount of risk you have. The put that you are selling can be in the money, but don\u2019t get your panties in a wad. If you are doing this ultra hacker strat you will have long dated puts, so it only matters where the put is at when it hits expiry. \n\nWe know that JPow is going to continually fuck us with his green dildo until the market recovers and the economy ramps up again. Buy long-dated put credit spreads with expiry being at the time when you think the market is recovered. If you are still worried, go fucking longer. Sell in the money puts if you\u2019re a badass (like me).\n\nWith this strat, you can continually make money, find a good job with a decent salary, settle down and create a family on the countryside, hold long term stocks, invest in real estate, and after your premature death your wife\u2019s boyfriend can yolo it all on FDs.\n\nSounds like the tits are going to stay downwards for this one, right? \n\nTLDR: Sell SPY 300p 12/31, buy SPY 298p 12/31  \n\n^max loss $200 - credit you\u2019ll receive. So like $110 bucks. Easy tendies.", "created_utc": 1585703072.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fspiai/easy_new_strat_for_suffering_bears/", "is_self": true}
