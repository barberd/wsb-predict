The warrants on FMCI jumped from $0.25 to $1.10 and climbing this morning on news that they signed a letter of intent with a plant-based food company.\n\nThe rumor going around is Impossible Foods may be the reverse merger in mind. I bought 500 warrants on FMCI at $0.90 today for $450. Obviously nothing material yet, but if Impossible Foods or another big target is announced by name this could explode.\n\nAdd FMCI and FMCIW to your watchlists.", "created_utc": 1589471585.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gjozkj/potential_spac_play_fmci_and_fmciw/", "is_self": true}
