{"id": "d1lor0", "title": "Houghton-Mifflin Harcourt is dying", "selftext": "You may not realize this, but elementary school teachers don't just get drafted out of college and left alone to apply what they know.  School systems spend millions of dollars on \"teaching systems\" to support particular teaching methodologies and to supply the material that enables that teaching.  Books, supplements, handouts, course outlines, lesson plans, etc.\n\nBy far the largest publisher of this material is Houghton-Mifflin, and they made more than half a billion dollars doing it last year.  In fact, the division of the company that sells this material is the *only* bright spot in a company that is otherwise slowly-circling the shower drain.  Their FCF was -$181 million last quarter, a record.  Yet, this quarter will likely see a return to positive FCF as this shithole company has become almost entirely reliant on the seasonal profitability of their teaching system division to stay afloat.\n\nYet, this one bright spot is about to burn out.  HMHC pushes a system called \"three cueing\" in its elementary offerings, which teaches kids to read not based on sounding words out (phonics), but on looking at pictures and interpreting stories to infer or guess what a hard word might be.  While this sounds good, decades of research has shown that it\u2019s inferior to phonics.  Recent research has shown that not only is three cueing worse than straight phonics, it actively harms kids ability to read, setting them back for years.  HMHC knows this, yet they continue to push their three cueing systems because they\u2019re enormously profitable.\n\nIn the last year, though, [new work](https://www.apmreports.org/story/2019/08/22/whats-wrong-how-schools-teach-reading) has begun getting traction to a degree that hasn't happened before.  Big school systems like Oakland, California are starting to experiment with structured, phonics-based programs, which has the potential to leave HMHC out to dry, since three-cueing is still their star product.  Houghton-Mifflin is already a garbage company in a dying industry that has been slowly circling the drain for several years.  This, however, could be the last nail in the coffin.", "created_utc": 1568001176, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d1lor0/houghtonmifflin_harcourt_is_dying/", "is_self": true}
