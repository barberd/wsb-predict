{"id": "fxyrau", "title": "Some DD for you Bulls and Bears", "selftext": "Alright I'm bored as fuck and thought I'd give some perspective on a grad economics students with fuck all to do other than watch the market and lose money. \n\nFirst and foremost COVID-19 is a public health emergency that is going to affect the lives of everyone around the world regardless of your social status or health. With that said, this health emergency can easily turn into a financial crisis given certain circumstances. I'm neither a bull or a bear at the moment but I'll offer the following insight:\n\n**1) Why won't the market go down?** After witnessing that initial panic selloff from February 19th to March 23rd of around 36% of the DJIA you should be asking yourself why/how? Did companies suddenly become 30% less valuable? Were markets overvalued? Was this just panic? In my opinion, the selloff was a result of the Western world realizing we weren't immune to the effects of the pandemic in our own countries, and with a combination of panic, sold off the the low seen March 23rd. At this date we were largely not socially distancing or interrupting normal routines; however, the market was/is forecasting the loss in revenues/spending of consumer markets for the short term. This bull run that's followed has also been a combination of a LOT of factors. These include people claiming this is a perfect time to buy and maybe a too dramatic initial selloff.\n\n**2) Where are we at today?** My stance as of today is that we are still underestimating the effects of COVID-19, but its financial implications will depend several factors. Let's compare this pandemic to one seen before, the Spanish Flu. Although this is a hard event to compare considering the more connected and consumer orientated economy we live in today, I think it does offer some important insight: https://imgur.com/a/jJvYMqv . According to the CDC^[1](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-commemoration/pandemic-timeline-1918.htm), first cases were noticed at an army camp in Kansas around April 1918. Considering this was during the end of WW1 there is a lot of economic and social factors to acknowledge, but note that the DJIA was sitting at 1,412 around this month.\n\nThe second, and deadly wave, hit the United States hit when soldiers starting coming back home around September and October of the same year^[2](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-commemoration/pandemic-timeline-1918.htm). Also note that^[3](https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-i/1918-flu-pandemic):\n>Additionally, hospitals in some areas were so overloaded with flu patients that schools, private homes and other buildings had to be converted into makeshift hospitals, some of which were staffed by medical students.\n\n>Officials in some communities imposed quarantines, ordered citizens to wear masks and shut down public places, including schools, churches and theatres. People were advised to avoid shaking hands and to stay indoors, libraries put a halt on lending books and regulations were passed banning spitting.\n\nThis is where shit started to really hit the fan, but guess what, the DJIA bottomed in Jan 1919 at 1,263.72 from 1,365 back in Sep 1919 marking a 7.41% fall in the market. This was followed by a 10 month boom in the market, and later a recession/depression. I mention all of this because by and large this pandemic appears to have had limited effects on the financial markets of 1918.\n\n**3) Why today might be different** From the stuff I mentioned above, there are large reasons to expect why today might be different. The American economy of 1918 was largely manufacturing focused unlike today's service economy. Today, we are very reliant on world trade for global supply chains AND the majority of first-world economies enjoy great benefits from tourist based industry. But, let's look at some more historic data. First, the unemployment rate. Using historic estimates from [this](https://www.nber.org/chapters/c2644.pdf) paper, we can see that there really wasn't very noticeable changes in the unemployment rate of the civilian labour force. Comparing that to today, however, we might notice how dramatic the change in unemployment making me consider our current levels are headed towards recession levels seen in the past 100 years.\n\nJust took a break from writing this to take in the FED news. Here's the next part\n\n**4) Potential scenarios** In my opinion, there are three ways this plays out with the majority of them being fairly bad. First, the FED keeps up the unlimited QE in the hopes of propping up the economy artificially hoping that COVID-19 subsides, and we go back to normal spending habits and furloughed employees get rehired. This is BEST CASE scenario, and there's still going to be a lot of govt debt (considering Americans were at 4.5% of GDP of public debt before this) that they will somehow have to deal with over the next decade. Scenario two is that social distancing does not relieve COVID pressures like it supposed to and government has to implement stricter quarantine measures that put significantly more downward pressure on economic activity, leading to more decline in markets and GDP growth. Third case is COVID-19 sticks around substantially longer than we're estimating right now dampening economic activity for the better part of this year. IF this happens the FED and Government are not going to be able to prop up corporate debt and keep markets liquid. That would be the real shitstorm of all shitstorms.\n\n**5) Other things to consider** I think the majority of WSB, myself included, have been expecting the crash to end all crashes, but we're not at doomsday yet. A LOT of industries are not going to recover from this for a VERY long time. Think about tourism (hotels, airlines, luxury goods), I do not know if anyone is going to risk let alone be allowed to travel internationally for the majority of this year, and unless those companies get another major bailout later this year, their earnings are going to suck big time. Next is a bit of anecdotal evidence but I would be hugely concerned about housing in the medium to long run over the next year. People are NOT buying houses right now considering all of this uncertainty, and as long as buyers stay away from the market (both commercial and residential) I believe we'll see some serious depression is hot market prices.\n\n\nTLDR Forecasts? Markets continue to rally until stricter quarantine measures are implemented, earnings this quarter are going to be shit but not as shit Q2. Fed will keep pumping markets until we see corporate debt not being repaid.", "created_utc": 1586460059.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxyrau/some_dd_for_you_bulls_and_bears/", "is_self": true}
