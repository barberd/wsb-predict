{"id": "gr56s6", "title": "KR breakout going to happen", "selftext": "I think there is potentially a play in KR coming up in the next few weeks.  All common sense says groceries stores should be insulated from \ud83c\udf7a\ud83e\udda0. It also says they are not the most exciting stonks to play normally.\n\nSo my thought is KR saw upgrades or PT increases from Wells Fargo and JP.  Then proceeded to fall even father an a day when market went way up.  Most likely due to people pulling money from a safe play to get in on the exciting plays.  Think in terms of bots trading and rate of change. \n\nBesides the upgrades there is also a Zacks article on value and earnings pitting KR vs WMT in which KR wins. \n\nAll this leads to believe KR will correct for drop today regardless of markets in near future. This upward correction will compound with positive news to build enough momentum for the rate of change bots to jump on board and run this baby up past the $33 resistance and into the $34-$38 range where it may form new base.\n\nMaybe it doesn't happen exactly like this but 7/17 34c are less then $1 and I have a hard time believing KR isn't going up at least 10% in the next month and a half. \n\nTl;dr KR 7/17 34c because meat and potatoes can't go tits up.", "created_utc": 1590525648.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gr56s6/kr_breakout_going_to_happen/", "is_self": true}
