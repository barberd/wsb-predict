{"id": "bh944y", "title": "3M earnings disaster", "selftext": "So 3M missed big time in a booming economy. Most analysts believe this is a company problem and not a problem of the whole industry. They are right.  This is all MMM\u2019s fault. A few years back 3M started a project switching software to SAP. The people they put in charge of the project. This led to delays and people focusing on the wrong thing. That leads to less sales and missed revenue. Also they are promoting people that screw up big time. MMM corporate\u2019s thoughts are that they will do less damage the higher they are up. This leads the actually smart employ to be stuck below when they could be helping the company grow. Also with the 2000 being laid off, most of them will be lower level employees that actually work hard.", "created_utc": 1556201595, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bh944y/3m_earnings_disaster/", "is_self": true}
