They're up 2% today. 12% on the month. And 85% on the year. \n\nLiterally if I want to see a major correction on this bad bitch, I gotta go to the 5yr chart so I can see them dropping during the great Christmas depression of 2018. CRAZY stuff.\n\nAnyways, lets get into [the earnings discussion](https://ibb.co/WK68f8t) --\n\nAs shown in the chart above, Q4 earnings will be a steady climb up from q2 and q3. But 2020 Q1 is going to be insane. They'll guide higher because bitches love their fancy tight pants. \n\nAll in calls, it can't go tits up. BECKY till I die. \n\nYou can pick up a 12/6 $250 call for as cheap as $4 currently. Literally can't fail. \n\nAct fast or be left in the past", "created_utc": 1574876675, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e2jmc0/lulu_lets_talk_earnings/", "is_self": true}
