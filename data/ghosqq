{"id": "ghosqq", "title": "$RVLV Squeeze of a Lifetime ER 5/13 AH", "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nFirst time doing my own DD write up, I figured it was my time to contribute to the community here. It is a brief DD but gets the point across.\n\nTLDR; calls 5/15 or 6/19\n\nLess TLDR; Online women's retailer using tech and influencers, online retail up since April, bankrupt brick and mortars present great opportunities, women love to swipe daddy's credit card even in pandemics. Short squeeze of a lifetime happening as we speak. This thing can move liek wayfair. Youtube about analysis incase you are too retarded and can't read: [**https://youtu.be/LUGhAzd2izo**](https://youtu.be/LUGhAzd2izo)\n\n**Overview**\n\nRVLV is an online brand/retailer of women's clothes that all the hot instagram thotties like to wear [https://www.instagram.com/revolve/](https://www.instagram.com/revolve/). They are super popular among Millenial/Gen Z women who are willing to dish out a bit more cash on daddy's credit card for the latest fashions. Social media/infleuncer marketing is the hallmark of how they drive business and it has proven to be successful for them. The company uses its tech algorithms to predict and steer the latest trends so that they are able to keep light inventory and not burn too much cash (light inventory was actually an issue in their last ER). The company IPO'd in June 2019 and is profitable! 52 week high stock price of $48.36, 52 week low of $7.17. Sitting at \\~$15 as of this writing.\n\n**Stock During Covid19**\n\nIn the late weeks of March, the company released a statement that the pandemic had indeed hurt sales and that they would be withdrawing forward looking year guidance. The stock suffered from that news and has not recovered to its pre covid levels. Stock was around $21 pre covid, dropped down to about $7, now sitting at $15.\n\nHowever, based on this chart from BoA, online retail numbers are up significantly since April. Retail obviously is a very broad term, but I would like to think includes clothes and thus includes Revolve. The customer base of Revolve also is the wealthier kind who probably aren't suffering from unemployment but are instead bored and online shopping for new clothes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[BoA Chart](https://preview.redd.it/kadtxk7ib5y41.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7e6c08491e9d4303d5a5c96bbf47ceac568b560)\n\n**Stock Information**\n\nThis stock is massively manipulated. Retail makes up about .3% of all shares, so it is heavily owned by institutions/insiders. 40% of the retail shares are held short. This thing can squeeze the fuck up like Wayfair has and it has already started to on Friday. Up 50% since 9:30am on Friday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Showing ownership of stock](https://preview.redd.it/de5vo61sc5y41.png?width=925&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e4809980f9e522d235cca075a9bfe80fd7126c4)\n\nThing is, a lot of these shorts have yet to cover! So, I predict that they will cover in the coming days as well as after ER. This company is a tech/fashion company and is sooo far off its 52 week high while many other tech companies are hitting all time highs. I expect this thing to run big time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Shares short](https://preview.redd.it/6qocogvac5y41.png?width=3473&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c7cf29e8376dfd97ec62dfdd70ea088d4e813ab)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCompany is heavily shorted right now and way down from its pre Covid/52 week highs. ER is on Wednesday 5/13 and I expect a big jump afterwards. Company has no debt other than drawing down on $30m line of credit (good for investors in my opinion). Company IS PROFITABLE. J Crew and other brick and mortar retailers are dying and going bankrupt. I expect this company to fill the void and take that market share.
