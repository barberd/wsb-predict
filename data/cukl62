{"id": "cukl62", "title": "Restaurant Brands International DD", "selftext": "I saw a bunch of vegans hail about how amazing the impossible burger was last week but since Popeyes has rolled up a new chicken sandwich that apparently beats out Chick-fil-A, I went to my nearest Popeyes. They blocked the drive thru and said there was a 2-3 hour wait for a god damn chicken sandwich. There was very little standing room in the restaurant itself. If people are losing their fucking minds over this chicken sandwich, and had vegans losing their minds over BYND's pretentious cousin, I can only imagine they're printing tendies at this point. I mean think about it, a chicken sandwich is just a tendie sandwiched between two buns.", "created_utc": 1566597421, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cukl62/restaurant_brands_international_dd/", "is_self": true}
