{"id": "fktq0w", "title": "Twitch Data - Uptick in Gaming", "selftext": "TLDR: A healthy uptick in twitch stats makes me go in ATVI 4/17 57.5C or 60C.\n\n(would avoid TTWO and EA as their current game portfolios are rather weak (compared to Activision's))\n\nAnyone with a half brain knows the world is gaming right now with school closures, 'nonessential' business closures, work from home, and social distancing. I was able to gather some hard numbers on 'gaming engagement'\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[https://twitchtracker.com/statistics](https://twitchtracker.com/statistics)\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/x7e4bmo5wgn41.png?width=1736&format=png&auto=webp&s=db8e14c1ad1170dff2bfc48b7ea9604e1ff1d58d)\n\nOn Tuesday we observed \\~2.4M viewers, which is similar to Fri/Sat/Sun statistics. Prior weekdays we're observing 2.0M viewers. A recent \\~20% increase, cool. What's crazier, in the past 6 months, we're observing an average 1.2M viewers on a Tuesday. A \\~100% increase, *very cool*.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5gh1gkhgwgn41.png?width=1394&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ee7d07a957f4365c6f7b9c8e13e38936c11d0c6\n\nAgain, the uptick in twitch is pretty evident. We're on track to see at least 1,000M hours watched.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7kaghu1uwgn41.png?width=1754&format=png&auto=webp&s=981afd68a9ccd5143ac8c777a3df70d8164af5ee\n\nWe can see COD Warzone doing exceptionally well. A big question is whether or not it will sustain the hype. Because it is crossplatform out-of-the-box, I think we will see high levels of success given the 'social distancing' and school closures.---\n\n**Additional Readings**\n\n* Steam recently reported record breaking users (20M): [https://kotaku.com/over-20-million-people-were-on-steam-today-because-wha-1842347346](https://kotaku.com/over-20-million-people-were-on-steam-today-because-wha-1842347346)\n* Warzone, Twitch, Steam trends: [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%201-m&geo=US&q=warzone,%2Fm%2F0hgpf7h,%2Fm%2F03myz4](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%201-m&geo=US&q=warzone%2C%2Fm%2F0hgpf7h%2C%2Fm%2F03myz4&authuser=0)\n* 15 Million Warzone players in 4 days: [https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/14/call-of-duty-warzone-hits-15-million-battle-royale-players-in-4-days/](https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/14/call-of-duty-warzone-hits-15-million-battle-royale-players-in-4-days/)\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlanning on averaging down where I can. ATVI has been trading sideways for a week now, and I think today's early-morning surge is indicating it's gaining traction.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1sankxxtxgn41.png?width=1050&format=png&auto=webp&s=25f048c97f7920d958c8cb73d0172e30677fe1e5", "created_utc": 1584553670.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fktq0w/twitch_data_uptick_in_gaming/", "is_self": true}
