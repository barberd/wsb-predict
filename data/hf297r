Their product, Defencath (formerly Neutrolin), reduced catheter-related infections SIGNIFICANTLY. So significantly, that is anticipated to become standard use in the states. They are expected to hear back on their NDA acceptance/denial from the FDA within the next few weeks - maximum timeframe would be a month, or so.\n\nDuring Cormedix's Phase 2 trial, 4 weeks into a 10 week trial, the governing body halted the trial because they saw all they needed to - it was that convincing. The FDA granted them Fast-Track status (to get approval much faster) and they are allowed to proceed without an addition trial and recieve LPAD approval - which is a new, groundbreaking means of approval the FDA recently put in place - only 1 other drug has received this - ever.\n\nNow, the company was a penny stock and hit around $2 and decided to do a reverse-split to bring the price above $5, which is more attractive and inviting to institutional investors. The knock on this company is the executive leadership board of 2015 and before was corrupt and untrustworthy. Completely new management now. As of now, it is trading at $6.56 and has recovered beautifully from March lows.\n\nThe market cap is only $170 million and the market for Defencath is upwards of $1 billion per year - and that is extremely conservative. The board is made up of older professionals - people who have been in the big-pharma business for decades. They do not strike anyone as a team who is ready to bring the drug to market themselves and watch the company rise in value over the next few years - they will go for a partnership or buyout.\n\nAll in all, this is a very low float trading stock. Good news and it can double or triple, easily, with volume. A buyout for $1 billion, which is conservative, puts the stock price around $27.\n\nI have been long here and following the company extremely closely for 2 years - this is a huge opportunity for some of you to get in at pre-split levels of under $1.40 - there is HUGE UPSIDE here.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions - I am pretty sure I can answer anything related to this company and product.
