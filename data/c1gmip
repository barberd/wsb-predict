My DD was Trump saying he would build a Great Wall with steel. X went to 45 (Huge nut) and now it\u2019s 13(reverse nut) I forgot to mention I\u2019m the only long time bull that loses money. My next endeavor was buying  Boeing (BA) at 400 and again at 380 and thought...this cannot go tits up... I bought again at 360. It\u2019s now 345. I\u2019ve been watching some intelligent homies on WSB yoloing and making a fortune. It\u2019s time to put my life\u2019s savings into BA on the resurrection of the 737 Max. Worst case scenario is I lose on this and I take out 2 fat loans. 1st yolo is all in on penny stocks. If that doesn\u2019t work I\u2019m done w trading and going all in on black at the Mirage in Vegas. \nSomebody....agree with me......my DD today is that fed will pls pls pls cut rates and save my stocks so I don\u2019t have to rob a bank after my loan requests are denied\nGod bless", "created_utc": 1560728703, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/c1gmip/infectious_retardation_infatuation/", "is_self": true}
