Second wave will be brutal, but it's not coming any time soon.", "selftext": "**TLDR: Second wave is coming, but not until in October. Models again are retarded as fuck. Bet against restaurants, bars, gyms, and cruises.**\n\nDeleted my other account for reasons, and you can't post unless your account is old (mods gay), so I had to bring this one back from the dead.\n\nYou might remember me [from my last DD](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fyqgre/itll\\_soon\\_be\\_apparent\\_that\\_the\\_us\\_is\\_going\\_to/) where I told you guys we were going to have well over 60k deaths in the US. If you took my advice, you didn't end up longing vol, because nobody gave a fuck when the IHME model was shown to be complete horseshit. People die, and as JC said [the market don't give a fuck](https://i.redd.it/t2wzjo2b8l251.jpg). Since we've now hit double that 60k figure today and I've been seeing a ton of COVID-related bullshit getting posted lately, I decided it's a good time to clear all this shit up. Let's get to it.\n\n\n**Second Wave in the US is an inevitability. It will be brutal.**\n\nFirst off, the uptick in cases we're seeing now is not the second wave. We've seen infection count doubling time decrease from like 4 weeks to 3 weeks and the media has been losing their fucking mind. This isn't ideal, but this is still well under where simple policy changes (i.e., localized lockdowns -- keep an eye out) can keep things in control. Recall in March the doubling times we saw in the US and Europe were on the order of 3-4 days. More later.\n\nSecondly, the protests mean jack shit for a second wave. Scientist said \"large-scale gatherings are probably not the best idea right now\" and the media reported it as \"EVERYONE AT A PROTEST WILL BE BRINGING HOME THE RONA!!\". There is little to no evidence of wide-scale spread in outdoor environments. Full stop. Maybe there will be such evidence in a week or two, but don't hold your breath. \n\nRegardless, a second wave is coming and coming hard. This is basic shit. Epidemiology 101. 1+1=2 kind of shit. Respiratory illnesses are insanely seasonal. Like, I'm talking death rates being an order-of-magnitude lower during June than e.g., February. [Check this shit out yourself](https://wonder.cdc.gov/ucd-icd10.html) -- go to 'Request Form'->group by state and month->select some state->select some year->Cause of death J09->J11 (verified as flu).\n\n[Why: many reasons](https://jvi.asm.org/content/81/11/5429), but most likely it's three drivers:\n\n1. *Physiology*: Our immune systems are stronger and our lungs function 'better' in warm (sunny) weather.\n\n2. *Behavior*: we spend more time outside, eat on patios at restaurants, go golfing instead of bowling, don't have school, etc. We inherently limit the possibility for close-proximity exposure to infected people.\n\n3. *Environment*: Warm and sunny weather degrades viruses faster. Humid weather prevents viruses from being suspending in the air.\n\nWhile incidence of flus and colds (including coronavirus colds) drop to almost nil in the summer, we're still seeing continued spread from COVID because it's a novel virus and a fuckton more contagious than most of those. We're seeing hundreds of daily deaths from COVID now and will only see a relative handful of deaths IN TOTAL directly from the flu over the summer. COVID is both several times more contagious and deadlier than the flu. However, most of the country is keeping infection rates relatively flat or flat enough that it doesn't matter (also see: BoneMaster effect). As the seasonal effects become more pronounced during July and August, I expect that this trend will hold, encouraging more politicians to further loosen lockdown restrictions. \n\n**But what the fuck do you think is going to happen in the Fall after we've removed the bulk of social distancing, we have hundreds of thousands of 'seed' infections spread to every goddamn town in the country ready to start massive clusters, and the conditions for spread of a respiratory illness become just right again?**\n\nHint: shit won't be pretty, and [anybody who isn't fucked in the head is well aware of what's coming](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/13/coronavirus-ousted-hhs-vaccine-official-warns-congress-of-darkest-winter-in-modern-history.html).\n\n\n**Models are retarded, again.**\n\nSimply put, longer-term predictions are completely ignoring seasonality effects. Both the effects of warm weather AND cold weather. In other words, they're likely over-selling spread during the summer but VASTLY under-selling it in the Fall. [See what has thus-far been the most accurate model](https://covid19-projections.com/us), and how it shows infection rates essentially inversing seasonality. I re-reviewed the methodology for all of the major models, and the common theme is that seasonality is near-completely ignored. For a virus type that has multiple species with very well-established seasonality patterns. For a pandemic with a very strong historical precedence that had very strong seasonality patterns. *shaking my fucking head*\n\n\n**So how the fuck do we make money on this bullshit?**\n\nRestaurants, bars, gyms, and cruises are fucked. We know these are abso-fucking-lutely terrible for the spread of COVID. There is zero debate here. My prediction:\n\nSeasonality effects will mitigate spread of COVID everywhere in the US in the coming months. The low spread will allow restaurants, bars, gyms, and possibly cruise ships to operate at increasing capacity and decreasing restrictions. Their stocks will continue to rebound. If they're operating under relative normalcy by October, they are fucked. Restrictions are NOT going to be pro-actively increased by politicians. There is going to be story after story of outbreaks showing up in the news directly attributable to these locations. Restrictions and shutdowns will be put in place, but I suspect it will just be for these There are very few infection clusters directly attributable from retail stores, and politicians will want to avoid another widespread economic shutdown while still doing 'something'. Although, the second wave will very likely be significant enough to overwhelm the healthcare system again in certain areas, so another full lockdown is very much not off the table.\n\nLoad your shorts (CCL, PLAY, PLNT, whatever the fuck else has exposure) throughout the summer. Buy very long-dated puts, as this is a longer-term play -- seasonality effects won't become apparent until October (maybe September) at the absolute earliest.\n\nPeople (via the media) also seem to think that a second wave is coming soon, despite [experts literally telling them it's not](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-first-wave-fauci/). When it actually does come in the Fall, this might be a surprise, despite every researcher saying to expect it. There is also the election, the lingering fallout from double digit unemployment, and whatever the fuck happens with 2nd/3rd quarter earnings and GDP numbers. This might all add up to one big shitshow, with several more months of nothing but shit news. This all together could move the broader market. But who the fuck knows? \n\nAlso, if someone knows how to short churches, please let me know.\n\nReal TLDR: more bear porn for the boys. <3", "created_utc": 1592496489.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbhjib/professor_bonemaster_here_with_ronadd_second_wave/", "is_self": true}
