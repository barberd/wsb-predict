Robinhood gave me notification that they confirmed they received my orders. At this point there were errors and i couldn\u2019t cancel them. \n\nBut the market price of my contracts ended up exceeding above and beyond what i put my limit order for. So Robinhood should have at least sold my options for me right? Wrong.\n\nHours later they notify me that my orders failed. WTF?\n\nSo they basically held my contracts hostage and i ended up losing a lot of money. would they be able to do anything? especially if i pay for RH gold?", "created_utc": 1583779460, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffzhvx/robinhood_sell_order_on_my_calls_failed_this/", "is_self": true}
