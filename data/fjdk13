{"id": "fjdk13", "title": "I want to say something about european situation", "selftext": "I really like this place. I mean really. Just some time ago I thought that I wont be able to be here again. I realized that I one of few sources of pure joy in my life. I want to be part of this Community specialy in those crazy times so I'd like to say something about me and my Portfolio. \n\nSo I am 23 years old guy with issues and lets say my name is Henrich. I want to mention that I live in Europe. Currently I stay in Munich, Germany,  I came here to from Netherlands but I am not Dutch or German. I learnt dutch langauge and because german is pretty similiar I wanted to find a job here, but because of Covid I have to start tommorow working by DHL since no company wants to hire any personel. Germany will be on lockdown tommorow and now I am stucked here and all other countries are also closing borders with germany so It gets pretty tense.\n\nMy current assets/liabilities are: \n\n- 4 banks account - 3 of them are equal 0, one has probably  around -1500\u20ac which is maximal overdrawn limit. I cannot access any of them because I thrown away the wrong simcard attached to my bank accounts. All of them are also in Netherlands so I cannot change a number\n\n- Peugeot 207 - Miracle of french engineering. I got it for free and I had to replace half of parts, I did everything myself so there no much value..\n\n- 250\u20ac in cash\n\n- 1800\u20ac of \"vakantiegeld\" - 8% is saved in Netherlands as reserve by a employer, around 1000\u20ac after taxes but I will receive it over 3 weeks. \n\n- THE BEST ONE - 2800\u20ac of employment benefit which after taxes will be around 2000\u20ac paid in next 4 months .  \n\n- 8 contracts of OTM AEX 03/20 puts (various strike price) worth totally 800\u20ac. \n\n -P3 class breathing protection with 5 pairs of new replacable filters, lot of tools and power tools, handgloves, hand sanitzer and other shit. \n\n\nSo like you see Its not much, but if I will use my Portfollio properly I can accomplish a success.\nI am young and so I shouldnt die or get very sick because of this novel virus but honestly we dont know that yet. Currently I feel sick and have some difficulty breathing but I didnt make any human contact with other people except grocieries and going to some Interview ( at the end waste of time).\n\nI expect to make some good return with my options on monday opening then sell options and buy more puts and repeat until it making some decent sum. Now what I can do Is exchange for swiss franks and expect to survive this storm, but I can tell you that it will we crazy. All countries getting lockdown with all Businesses closed will make a fucking depression. \n\nThey Expected a reccession before this pandemic. After outbreak in china all companies are missing parts which maybe could be produced now in China by forcing people to work, but because of virus outbreak in Europe its doesnt matter a shit. The companies wont be able to operate now situation in europe and it will take next few months to get things back to normal. Italy, Germany, Austria, Switzerland France, Denmark, Poland, Czech Republic are offically closed from each other. Only citizens are allowed to enter and are forced to Self-Quarant\u00e4ne.\n\nSo tommorow sell your puts with gainz and buy more puts and repeat until all wealth is transfered to us. I am for sure autisic, my mother told me that I am retarded since I remember and I know its our time to finally rule this world.\n\nAutisists Rejoice.
