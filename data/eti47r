Buy MU 90c.\n\nGet a phone call, it's CNBC. \"You're a genius sir, we'd like to interview you\" they say.\n\nGet a knock on my door. I open it and it's Masa Son. \"Well done sir\", he says shaking my hand and giving me a check for $10 billion. \"Lets see you do what that Adam could never do.\"\n\nAir force one pulls up outside my apartment window. The door opens and it's mango man. He extends his hand, covered in duck fat. \"That's a good job, a great job, tremendous, one of our very best. Those gaylords in gyna wish they had you, Hillary is fake and gay\". I shake his hand, contracting coronavirus as he flies away.\n\nMy girlfriend is in the room next door getting gangbanged by 20 MMA fighters but I don't care.\n\nI bought calls today.", "created_utc": 1579906595, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eti47r/i_bought_calls_today/", "is_self": true}
