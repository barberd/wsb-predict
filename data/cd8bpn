Come to me.\n\nGive me a ticker and I'll tell you what options to buy by flipping a coin (Heads=calls, Tails=puts) and then rolling a die (1=deep in the money by 5% or more, 2=in the money by 1-4.99%, 3= At the money, 4=Out of the money by 1-4.99%, 5=Out of the money by 5% or more, 6=roll again. 3 6's in a row is the devil's number and means Lady Luck is just waiting to kick you in the nuts, so maybe do something smart with your money instead) If you're a true autist and don't know what in the money or out of the money mean, stop what you're doing, rethink your life, and don't waste my fucking time.\n\nDon't do the same ticker twice you lazy fucks. \n\nDisclaimer: The content herein does not constitute investment advice.
