{"id": "f8c1qk", "title": "I am done with AMD", "selftext": "Most of you don't understand but regardless of what happens. Gold is of last year a tier 1 asset, that puts it at the same level as Tbills and USD. This is why central banks are starting to horde it. Also, as of last year the Shanghai exchange has more more gold than Comex. (Which moves substantially more than the LBMA) Why? Because of of march 2017 shanghai now does oil futures, these contracts are immediately convertible mark to market with gold. Countries like Iran, Venezuela, Russia, etc have been using this system. (This is why the trade tariffs were brought in on April 2017)\n\nIf the US keeps printing money and all of the central banks cut to zero or negative interest rates, then with inflation, that makes gold a high yield debt instrument that is as liquid as the USD. Right now central banks are hording gold but soon commercials will start filling their books with it.\n\nForget tech stocks, welcome to tendies town. $FNV is your new NVDA and $SAND your new AMD. $RGLD is your new MSFT and GDX/GDXJ your new SPY/IWM. For a period going forward all of these will go up. Then some will continue while others stall, but this time in 2022. The only BS that will be posted on WSB will be the ones I have mentioned.\n\nYou have all been warned, buy calls accordingly.", "created_utc": 1582476839, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8c1qk/i_am_done_with_amd/", "is_self": true}
