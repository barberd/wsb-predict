Q2 will be great no doubt, but since the stock market is forward looking it might not matter, since at the latest q4 and 2021 will be shit. Also if the stocks continue to plummet so freaking heavily (might end up -6% today), what does it matter if it jumps 30% on Q2 earnings when it's down 50% before that.\n\nAny upsides?", "created_utc": 1592422174.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hayb97/what_to_do_with_tanker_shares/", "is_self": true}
