When I literally do zero research, spend zero time on when to enter and exit the market, I usually earn money. The more DD I do, the less it works out for me. I'm new to options having started only a few weeks ago so very new. But so far down 34% of my portfolio and I feel like I'm better off doing my trade analysis, then immediately inversing the decision I come up with because fuck it, I usually do better that way.\n\n\\---------------------------------\n\nFor those actually considering helping, ill add more info: I started at 7k, now down to 4.6k. I still have more to learn on options as I'm learning small things every day. But I do know how the delta theta vega rho gamma can affect an option price and in what ways they vary depending on the strike, and the underlying stock (i.e. delta calls go to 1 ITM, theta higher near exp, vega highest ATM, things like that. I've learned IV crush, theta decay, way too OTM strikes, low volume strikes/slippage, and IV run-up, FDA approvals, earnings run-up and post-earnings corrections, the goods and bads of weeklies all the hard way by losing money. I probably still need to work on having smaller position sizing but its WSB so what's the fun without at least some YOLO?\n\nOn DD, as I usually hold options no more than a month and a half out from exp (and often weeklies), I focus more on the technicals and price action. Since my account is below 25k, I am always bumping close to PDT rules. So normally I try to swing trade. If I don't decide to YOLO, tools I mostly use are open int., volume, IV and IV rank+percentile, BA spreads, the greeks, theo price (for seeing if there's a liquidity problem/low risk play), VWAP, PC ratio, sizzle, RSI, CCI, MACD, stochastic, and bollinger. I usually cycle them between the 5 and 20 day charts to see the general flow of a stock first to try to get a cheap buying point in the options mkt. Also I will soon be looking to include fibonacci into my research. I also do basic valuation filtering on PE, EPS, Net Profit, DE, etc, but I usually let some crazy valuations go since I'm more short term. Finally, I do look out for company news in the past month such as pending FDA approvals, M&amp;A, earnings, patents, and I always review general sell side street analyst sentiment using MarketWatch, SeekingAlpha, Yahoo Finance, Nasdaq, and Benzinga. Trying to get more into TastyTrade.\n\nGranted, much of the money I lose is because of tough lessons learned, but I feel like I'm missing something. My biggest dollar losses came from LSCC, MSFT, GILD, and PFE calls. Anyone got ideas, pointers, tips on newbies like me? I just wanna make my money back at this point lol. Thanks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd don't say buy SPCE. I already did and I net profited. But only 30% gain off of one contract because it seemed risky af. Today shot up to another gain of 34% at the intraday high.
