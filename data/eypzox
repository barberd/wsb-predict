Now the rest of retail and institutions are catching up and hopping on the train to tendie town. Like for real holy shit you guys have cucked everyone\u2019s boyfriend on this sub simply by the will of your iron hands and balls of steel. \n\nIm so fucking envious of all these gains, but at the same time so proud that this community held to their beliefs and was rewarded for it.\n\nNow, taking a step back,  i think that TSLA is THE example of why stonks only go up and how the market keeps this desperate gravy train running. Do these valuations make sense? Not at all. What justifies a 30% gain in a year when wages are stagnating, people are in just as much debt as 07\u2019 and there has been no real growth, only buy backs this year? FOMO. Thats right people are experiencing extreme FOMO every time they check SPY, they see this shit cranking to new ATHs and they just want a piece of the action. Thats what TSLA is but amplified 10x because its truly the first manufacturing company that can scale clean energy products, it\u2019s literally a unicorn and you retarded bunch managed to get in the bottom(lol 250-400 is the bottom now) and ride it to tendieland.\n\nNothing is going to stop TSLA(only some extremely serious design flaw that causes a massive recall) and this stonk market wont drop until we either have negative interest rates on US treasuries or unemployment increases so much that people cant make the min payments on their debt. But until then, stonks only go up, dont short tsla, and buy the fucking dip.", "created_utc": 1580822685, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eypzox/tsla_is_the_embodiment_of_this_stonk_market/", "is_self": true}
