Today\u2019s email from a large national lender:\n\n\u201cFor the past two weeks, we have been working tirelessly to prepare for the SBA\u2019s new Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). Despite widespread publicity about the government-sponsored, private-sector program being ready to accept applications by Friday, April 3rd, SBA has NOT provided adequate guidance to us on how the program will be effectively administered. Joining dozens of the largest financial institutions across the country, including JP Morgan Chase, we will NOT begin submitting to SBA on April 3rd as we had previously hoped. However, please understand we have every intention of participating in and championing this program.\n \nRest assured, earlier this evening we received the \u201cInterim Final Rule\u201d from SBA on the new PPP loans. While this document is a good step in the right direction, it is still insufficient to most in the lending community. We truly hope that SBA will provide the necessary guidance we need very shortly. \u201c\n\nMuch of the optimism in the SMB community has been centered on this forgivable lending option.  \n\nSYY 4/17 35p \nUBER 4/17 20p\nUSFD 4/17 10p\nDRI 4/17 35p", "created_utc": 1585914661.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fu70zo/printer_jam/", "is_self": true}
