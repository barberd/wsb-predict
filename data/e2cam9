Robinhood was and is mostly a trendy app for younger folks.\n\nSo why did Schwab dropped commissions to zero recently? I think it is to put pressure on competitors like TDA, whose stock plummeted after this move and thus their valuation was much lower than a few months ago. And what happens next? Schwab makes a takeover offer to TDA! Schwab will get TDA for a bigly discount.\n\nWell played Schwab, very cool and very legal !!", "created_utc": 1574838261, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e2cam9/schwab_acquiring_td_ameritrade_very_cool_and_very/", "is_self": true}
