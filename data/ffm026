And on a Sunday of all days.  Peak retard.\n\nI probably already have the virus, because the people of Walmart are fucking disgusting pigs, so I'm hoping to profit soon so I can leave my family with enough money to pay for a backyard cremation and a coffee can.\n\nHere are the categories and consumables of note that the filthy mongrels of Walmart are panick buying:\n\n**ABSOLUTELY DECIMATED**\n\nTP\nWater - Bottled and 1gal.\n\n*Seriously, i just orderd a bidet because I don't think I will be able to get my hands on some shit paper for 90 days.  Also stocked up on brita filters because tap water is for poor people who are too retarded to know that the government puts vaccines in the water.*\n\nRice &amp; beans\nRamen\nCanned meat, beans, and vegetables\n\n*Apparently Asians, Mexicans, and white trash are panic buying the most.  Who else buys any of of that shit?*\n\n**HEAVILY BOUGHT**\n\nPasta &amp; Sauce\nGrain/Protein/Health Bars\nFrozen Foods\nGatorade/Powerade\nCanned soup (Campbell's soup only....apparently we are not as Progresso as nation as we thought)\n\n*The major winners in the FF category were 1)  Chicken Pot Pies, 2) Frozen Taquitos, and 3) Healthy Fresh frozen dinners.  Cannot make this shit up.  This adds a solid amount of ammo to my previous theory.*\n\n**SHIT NOBODY IS TOUCHING WITH A 10ft POLE**\n\nDairy\nCereal\nSnacks, chips, candy, &amp; treats\nCanned fruit (kind of surprised me tbh)\nBread\nSoft drinks\nFrozen Pizzas\nHot Pockets (nobody wants to shit their pants during the apocalypse?)\n\n*It is also worth noting that the Walmart brands were the most bought items in the aforementioned categories.  Again....trash people ravaging the stores*\n\nTLDR; Canned goods, shelf stable, and select frozen foods are in.  TP and water are killing it.  Everything else is still on the shelf.\n\nDiscuss so I can make my pp big.", "created_utc": 1583713327, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffm026/risked_my_life_to_do_some_dd_lets_discuss_how_to/", "is_self": true}
