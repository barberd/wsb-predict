{"id": "g15mzs", "title": "Margin Call - Need advise", "selftext": " \n\nI had opened an Iron Condor last week on $TSLA expiring 5/15. The price went up so I closed out the short put for profit leaving me with the long put & call and the short call. The price continued to go up so I did another credit spread May 15th expiration thinking it would start coming back down. Yesterday morning I rolled the 2 long calls into a single June 19 580C for a credit. Not sure what I was thinking and the order should never have gone through since I didn't have the margin for that. But it did go through and then $TSLA promptly shot up to mock me.\n\nAs expected I woke up today to a margin call email they need $15K to cover the margin now. As of right now if this position is liquidated will I lose $7K (current market value - Long June 580C = 13K, Short May 600C x 2 =20K) . I'm thinking I can sell the June Call contract for 2 May 15th Calls in an attempt to reduce the margin requirement and then let it play out from there. Not sure if this is a horrible idea or if I have any other option here. Any help would be appreciated (Yes I know where I am, I'm desperate).\n\nCurrent positions:\n\n2 x TSLA 600.00 CALL MAY 15, 2020 (SHORT)\n\n1 x TSLA 580.00 CALL JUN 19, 2020 (LONG)\n\n1 x TSLA 380.00 PUT MAY 15, 2020 (LONG)", "created_utc": 1586871354.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g15mzs/margin_call_need_advise/", "is_self": true}
