{"id": "epkndq", "title": "An Investigation into Aurora\u2019s (ACB) financials", "selftext": "Hi everyone- I\u2019m a college student looking to enter the cannabis research field. In my free time, I like to write about publicly traded companies. Aurora (ACB) has intrigued me for the last few weeks so I wrote up a report about the company's liquidity risk. From some reformulation of the financial statements I think the market consensus that the company won't be able to afford its debt is wrong. I currently don't have money in ACB but I'll buy some stock after the write down of its Goodwill built up from the MedReleaf acquisition, which I think wiIl happen next quarter (Early Feb - May 2020).\n\nTLDR- ACB\u2019s liquidity issues are overblown and management is already in the process of mitigating them. The company is primed to outperform after its write down of Goodwill; could be a buy after it's announced.\n\nInvestors are spooked by ACB\u2019s deteriorating margins and the most recent quarter\u2019s loss. Through an analysis of the Q1 2020 financial statements, I think it\u2019s pretty clear that the company\u2019s cash and cash-like position is still strong enough to defend against increasingly high interest payments.\n\n[https://assets.ctfassets.net/rhxhcf3cql1g/7p3Er952vcGekZovryfU7y/6969db5521c23a7f172d96805e5876e5/FS\\_2019.09.30\\_11.14.2019.pdf](https://assets.ctfassets.net/rhxhcf3cql1g/7p3Er952vcGekZovryfU7y/6969db5521c23a7f172d96805e5876e5/FS_2019.09.30_11.14.2019.pdf)\n\nACB\u2019s stock price is down more than 70% over the last twelve months. The bear case is primarily driven by the threat of a liquidity trap where the company doesn\u2019t have enough cash on hand to pay for its debt.\n\nLet\u2019s start by looking at the current financial picture. It\u2019s a little tricky to understand the true debt profile because ACB reports it with most of its other income in the income statement. Fortunately, Note 13 gives some information about all payments outstanding (including the current and long-term debt the company owes). By using the metrics in this note, I am taking an extraordinarily conservative view of debt because it assumes all money owed can be considered \u201cdebt\u201d, instead of flowing into expense liabilities and the possibility of conversion to equity. As of September 2019, C$514,999 is current and C$1,422,042 is long-term. There is C$152,526 in cash on hand.\n\nThe market's concern is headlined by ACB\u2019s negative interest coverage ratio and a quick ratio of 0.63 (acid test ratio). I agree that the company is not perfectly positioned to cover all of its current liabilities which does represent a huge risk. But the tangible assets on the company\u2019s balance sheet are being undervalued as a way to protect against a liquidity threat.\n\nI view ACB has more of an industrial, capital intensive business. For instance, the PPE account grew more than 27% since last quarter to C$972,788 and intangible assets, items like dispensary licenses, permitting, and IP, totaled more than C$682,694, compared to a sales total of C$281,097 in FY2019. I calculated the capital intensity of the company by estimating the amount of assets to produce a dollar of sales, or total assets divided by sales. Every publicly traded company classified in the marijuana cultivation and distribution industries came in above market averages for capital intensity. This makes it more appropriate to use the asset coverage ratio (tangible and liquid assets \u2013 short-term debt)/total debt) as a way to think about default risk because it factors in the high cost of fixed assets, like equipment and licenses, necessary to make money in the industry.\n\nContinuing the trend of being conservative, I removed ACB\u2019s overvalued Goodwill and all non-marketable intangibles from the asset calculations. I added back the valuable and relatively liquid licenses and permitting assets. Tangible assets of $1,751,099, permits and licenses of C$206,886, current debt of C$514,999, and total debt of C$1,422,042 are used. ACB\u2019s asset coverage ratio is 1.13. Not amazing, but it\u2019s above the peer set mean and tells the story of a company with the ability to cover its debt appropriately or at least be in a position of strength when negotiating covenants. Additionally, the company can still draw from a C$360 million credit facility and has access to a $400 million at-the-market equity program. I don\u2019t understand why analysts are crowning ACB as the next financial disaster in the sector when in reality it\u2019s a company relatively ready to deal with its debt.\n\nWhile this doesn\u2019t necessarily prove the stock will go up, I think it shows that analyst views that the stock is \u201cgoing to zero\u201d are overblown and putting huge downward pressure on the price. It\u2019s a self-fulfilling cycle that may be misguided.\n\nThe company has already proven it\u2019s willing to sell underperforming assets to maintain a sufficient cash balance. On January 6th, Aurora listed a greenhouse for sale for $17 million, one it acquired as a primary location in its acquisition of MedReleaf Corp. in 2018.\n\n[https://business.financialpost.com/cannabis/cannabis-business/aurora-cannabis-lists-greenhouse-for-sale-in-move-that-implies-massive-writedowns-analyst](https://business.financialpost.com/cannabis/cannabis-business/aurora-cannabis-lists-greenhouse-for-sale-in-move-that-implies-massive-writedowns-analyst)\n\nThe market views this as a fire sale and a signal of write downs. That\u2019s true, ACB is probably going to write down its acquisition of MedReleaf, and consequently, its Goodwill. There is a view in the market that ACB\u2019s acquisition of MedReleaf in 2018 for $3.2 billion was one of the most overvalued in the industry\u2019s recent history. The stock will go down if/when the company makes the announcement, but it doesn\u2019t change the fundamentals of the business.\n\nThe company\u2019s products are viewed as best in class and will continue to have increasing demand. ACB now owns some of the top brands in the field and a vertically integrated supply chain. With the roll out of Cannabis 2.0, ACB is well positioned to be a market leader through its edibles product line.", "created_utc": 1579187806, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/epkndq/an_investigation_into_auroras_acb_financials/", "is_self": true}
