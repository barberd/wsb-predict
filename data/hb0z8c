This article supports that we still have support on our 20 day MA and also support on 17.50, as long as we maintain both of these supports, we are in bullish territory.Secondly, NCLH announced further delays on setting sail (which obivously tanked the whole cruise line industry), still we managed to close higher than open and had a nice intraday rally. As long as S&P futures do not tank overnight, this stock is going green tomorrow.  \n\n\nNCLH specifically has almost 3 billion in cash with a burn rate of 6.7 million a day, so enough runway too last until 2021 with zero revenue.
