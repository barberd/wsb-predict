What is even more fun than gambling with your own money? Gambling with the GOVERNMENT\u2019S money. \n\nI have another proposition for the troops here at WSB and I am HOPING you will join along. As we know Trump is starting to slide in the polls, multiple Republican factions are being created to side with Biden, and things are not looking good for the Repubs in November. Why am I telling you this? \n\nAren\u2019t you sick of hearing about a potential second stimulus check, but still your account remains empty? We know the Dems want it, but the Repubs are CBING it. \n\nIt\u2019s time for the people to take action and stand up for what we want and deserve. Let\u2019s get those second stimulus checks so we have another chance at some SPY lottos. \n\nWith that being said I encourage you to tweet the following at the President: \n\n\u201cRemember when Mnuchin said the stimulus check will last 10 weeks? Well, it\u2019s past 10 weeks and we want another check NOW! If you don\u2019t provide another stimulus check I will not be voting Republican in November.\u201d \n\nHopefully this will put some fire under their \ud83c\udf51 to stop teasing the American public with this nonsense. \n\nThank you.", "created_utc": 1593111219.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hfrslr/lets_get_those_stimulus_checks/", "is_self": true}
