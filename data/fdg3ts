{"id": "fdg3ts", "title": "Desperate times", "selftext": "Look guys things have been so slow today Its made my mental processes look like the goddam roadrunner. But I have a solution, since this market always will inverse you EVERYONE SELL IRON CONDORS ON SPY. Why? Its the only way to get it to move out of the 304-306 range. Sell some condors, SPY has no choice but to move straight into the arms of your Bull Cock Calls or Shmeaty Bear Puts depending on your orientation. Sure, we lose some money on the ICs but we just need to sell enough to trick the algos. If Im wrong? Keep your premium sweet autist.
