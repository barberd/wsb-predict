Do we think it\u2019s possible this might actually make any dough with only a few days left till expy? Price action was pretty strong to the downside and the market looks like it had an outside down day. Would love to see it strike $7 or retest the lows. Please give me your thoughts not that it matters much as I will prolly hold regardless cause fuck this market. \n\n\n[DOGS](https://giphy.com/gifs/dogs-brad-pitt-124qHhp74Mg9ri)", "created_utc": 1589318397.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gikoey/jblu_proper_fucked/", "is_self": true}
