Their margins were compressed along with all other 3pls in q4 so they're trading around 5 year lows. \n\nIf you want to see how this stock does during certain parts of the cycle i can tell you the last good cycles were 2014 and then mid 2017 thru q3 2018. The weak cycle was mid 2015 through all of 2016 and early 2017. 2018 was a record breaking year. \n\nTodays 7% dip is an overreaction and the market will turn within the next 12 months or so. \n\nKNX , a trucking company, predicted improving conditions this year and their stock is up 6% on \"good guidance.\" CHRW is down 7% because they did poorly in q4 but they #always refuse questions about predicting the market cycles. \n\nDD\n\n1. Many trucking companies have gone out of business this year due to low spot rates. \n\n2. Cost of insurance is becoming too high for many carriers due to excessive settlements being awarded when human life is lost (look up nuclear verdicts) \n\n3. Government regulations on driver drug testing are increasing (look up drug clearinghouse) \n\n4. Class 8 truck orders are near 10 year lows and prices of used class 8 trucks have dropped, signaling carriers are exiting the market rather than buying more equipment. \n\nSource - I'm a rates analysis for a major  LTL carrier", "created_utc": 1580320795, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/evqfnb/freight_dd/", "is_self": true}
