The markets way too overvalued, P/Es are up the wazoo, and Robinhood traders have been artificially inflating stock prices. Market correction was supposed to happen this week but who woulda thought JPow was going to give himself the superpowers to start buying back short term corporate debt at high volumes. My puts are kaput but just you bulls wait...it might take a year, maybe even 2 years, but the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bs will have their revenge. Trading fundamentals have gotten thrown out the window the past two months but at some point people will realize how fucked the market is rn and the bulls will be holding the bag.", "created_utc": 1592362174.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/haijr6/fuck_jpow/", "is_self": true}
