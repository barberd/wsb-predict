{"id": "gra54d", "title": "Gauging perspective on SpaceX launch affecting Boeing $BA", "selftext": "The gist of it is that over the last several years, SpaceX and Boeing have been in a space race funded by NASA over who could bring American astronauts to the ISS. SpaceX is scheduled to launch tomorrow at 4:30 PM Eastern, being deemed the \"winner\" if all goes well.\n\nThings to consider:\n\n- SpaceX has been seen as the dominant aerospace company in regards to the mission throughout the vast majority of the \"race.\"\n\n- $BA saw a ~10% decline in the month following their Starliner launch (launch revealed bugs in their flight software.) Additionally throughout that month, Boeing also was being scrutinized over safety concerns related to their 737 Max. How much of that 10% decline was due to the Starliner failure?\n\n- Boeing stock has been up 8% over the last week. Is healthy competition between American aerospace companies going to drive all relative companies up? Or will losing the \"space race\" negatively impact (short-term) the parties involved?\n\nCouple items in there for you autists to argue about below. Enjoy!\n \nNot apologizing for being on mobile, enjoy the format or get fucked :-)", "created_utc": 1590542990.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gra54d/gauging_perspective_on_spacex_launch_affecting/", "is_self": true}
