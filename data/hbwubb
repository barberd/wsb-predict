Earnings should be solid and dependable.\n\nNow you cant trade BIMBO stock on robin hood because its a Mexican stock, but all American bakeries CAN. So with Kroger riding riding a profit wave as long as you sell BEFORE earnings, why not go down the stack to the actual suppliers of grocery stores?\n\n  \nProblem is, I have no idea what American bakery would be best for a BIMBO play. I am iffy on Hostess because it was going bankrupt a few years ago, and I am blanking on other well known bakery brands.\n\nDoes this logic have legs for a play in America?", "created_utc": 1592554496.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbwubb/the_bimbo_play_does_it_have_legs/", "is_self": true}
