{"id": "hjy44u", "title": "UPS Earnings play", "selftext": "Just because this isn\u2019t papa Elon level down-syndrome, doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t make tendies...\n\nWe all saw FedEx run up 27% this week going into earnings. UPS also had a nice reaction to the FedEx gap up, and will continue to do so in the weeks before their earnings(7/22).\n\nA couple family friends work for UPS(mgmt, drivers, executives) and they don\u2019t shut the fuck up about the past few months being far busier than any Christmas season. In the past months, UPS has added about 20% more employees, leased multiple new aircrafts, expanded deliveries into Canada and Mexico, as well as built out 2 new major hubs in California. \n\nUPS financials:\nMarket cap: 99B (2x Fedex\u2019s)\nP/E ratio: 23 (FedEx-28)\nDiv yield: 3.60 (FedEx- 1.60)\nFair value: $121 (anticipate upgrade after ER(just like FedEx received))\n\nDo what you want with this surface level info. I\u2019m convince UPS will see $130 but 7/22.\n\nTLDR; UPS 116,117,120,121,122C 7/24\nUPS 120,125c 7/31\nUPS 122c 9/18\n\nThis message was approved by The Autism Awareness Foundation.", "created_utc": 1593700456.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hjy44u/ups_earnings_play/", "is_self": true}
