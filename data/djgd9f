The 2-3 weeks have been losing weeks for the TSX and I think I need to have more US stocks as they are now performing a lot better than Canadian stocks and should keep increasing into 2020. \n\n  Buy a few more shares of BIP.un (Brookfield Infrastructure Partners), This pays a good dividend (4.1%) and has lots of upward potential and Brookfield keeps buying new airports, sea ports, toll highways etc. I've owned this stock for a few years and it has increased handsomely over this time   \n\n\n keep watching Interfor and Superior Plus as candidates to sell if they don't start going up. The forest industry (IFP) is in a real decrease this year as housing starts in the US and Canada are way down. However, most of the lumber companies have shut down a good deal of their production and inventories are on the way down. If housing starts take off in the spring as I think they will, lumber stocks will soar. If IFP does not go up appreciably by March 2020, I should sell it. Propane companies like Superior Plus do well in the winter months, if this is a colder than average winter, this stock will do well and it does pay a 6% dividend while we wait.   \n\n\n Buy MA (Mastercard), DIS (Disney), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alibaba (BABA) and if you don't want to buy BABA because it is a Chinese company (it is the Chinese version of Amazon) but it is more encompassing and growing faster in Asia and has more upside than Amazon, 30% over the next year,  these listed blue chip companies have great futures ahead of them and they will be around decades from now\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThoughts?", "created_utc": 1571363178, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/djgd9f/moving_from_cdn_to_usd/", "is_self": true}
