Started taking profits off as it rose, but let one single contract run to $-4.\n\nMy single contract quickly became worth over $26,000.  The best part? There is no liquidity now since the contract expires 05/21 and I can\u2019t close this position.\n\nFeel free to shame me.\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/4zm3adcpx5u41.png?width=854&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab7a67f9411febabae3c9b3ea29e930437a42508](https://preview.redd.it/4zm3adcpx5u41.png?width=854&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab7a67f9411febabae3c9b3ea29e930437a42508)\n\nEdit update:\n\nThankfully the CME/NYMEX has procedures for situations like this. Final contract settlement is done by cash settlement (minus a small settlement fee) for those not wanting to take physical delivery. NYMEX rulebook section 698103 for those that like to do your own research.\n\nEdit 2:  yeah that rule book I referenced ? That\u2019s for a different product. Rip.\n\nEdit 3: Praise be to the Autism gods, I was able to exit my trade. Pic attached with final profit..Thank you all that have reached out offering your help to store this product. Best comment goes to u/quaeratioest \"love it when our austim bleeds into the physical realm like this\".. couldn't have said it better myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**tldr; I traded CL 05/20 futures in the negative price range the day before expiry, almost got cucked, got excited looking up the wrong settlement information on a different product, panicked, and ended up getting out of the trade and making $29,790.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zjglhql3k6u41.png?width=491&format=png&auto=webp&s=75111b38a694c306194519e74207f050ad8eb07b", "created_utc": 1587471156.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5e3e5/i_bought_oil_at_32_yesterday_and_made_26000_sort/", "is_self": true}
