Play is WFC 01/15 30C**,** which is far enough to maximize gains from the play, without overpaying in premium. \n\n**=========================================================================**\n\nHey all,  \n\nHave enjoyed following the community over the last quarters. Here is my humble contribution.\n\nIt has been a long and arduous journey with evaporated gains weighing heavy still, despite the recent market rallies. Through the mist and far into the dark distance, I see small lights flickering, leaving in their wake streams of sparkling vapors \u2013 I carefully make out a mystical space message:\n\n**\\*WFC\\*01/15\\*30C\\***\n\nThe sudden realization rings true: \n\nDo not fight the Fed. Stonks Only Go Up. \n\nThat\u2019s right, just because CPI is low doesn\u2019t mean inflation isn\u2019t happening--- all that sexy cash is being J-Pumped into risky assets through various programs as we speak. \n\nCombined with the upcoming election Trump Pump, continued fiscal stimulus, positive vaccine developments moving into 2021, and economies slowly opening, there is substantial upward pressure in equities.\n\nHowever, with broad equities having recovered towards their recent highs, US banks remain unfairly stranded behind: \n\n* SPY delta with 52W high: \\~ (-11%)\n* IWM delta with 52 high: \\~ (-18%)\n* **WFC delta with 52W high: \\~(-50%)**\n\nWFC is trading still at half its prior value, which is undervalued relative to the broader market, considering that the company\u2019s assets are mainly sector diversified senior loans, benefiting from higher downside protection than those shareholders accepting these loans. \n\nSimply put, considering the existing gap between WFC and the market, plus the upcoming Jerome and Trump Pumps, WFC offers excellent odds for an easy 11% rise across the $30 strike target, and into deep profit territory. \n\n**Why WFC specifically?** it is smaller than peers, went through some difficulties and now has higher caliber management, giving relatively higher upside while maintaining similar risk exposures.\n\n**Why Jan \u201921 Exp?** it is far enough to maximize gains from the play, without overpaying in premium.  \n\n**My position:** I have **17 contracts on WFC 01/15, purchased @ 2.89 each (\\~$4.9k)**. Plan on significantly increasing exposure (2-20x more) as gains accrue. Will post screenshots if/when numbers become worthy. \n\n**Disclaimer:** this is not investment advice, you should obviously do your own research before buying any securities, and yes when seeking tendies you could lose money", "created_utc": 1590719711.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gskbqu/my_time_has_come_ft_fed_pump_wfc/", "is_self": true}
