All of you are stuck in first order thinking, the business has an expiration date so it is worth 0. The business is actually worth whatever it can generate for investors before it goes to 0. So how much is this?\n\nThe mkt cap of the company is, as I write this, 450M. The book value of the company is 800M. So already here, even if you are thinking about liquidation you are getting the stock at a discount. Of course the management doesn\u2019t seem to want to liquidate so this might not be an option any time soon.\n\nManagement also has authorization to spend $240M in share repurchases. Best case scenario they have already been doing it. What is great about this stock is that it\u2019s daily volume (daily, high single digit Millions) would allow this operation to occur stealthily, giving the potential for a surprise at next ER. A few days ago, someone purchased/sold 3.5M shares (&gt; 4% of outstanding) in 5 minutes and the price barely moved. If they manage to spend at least half of what they are allowed at the current price ($120M), they could purchase 24M shares or 27% of the outstanding shares.  At current prices this would result in a price to book ratio of around 0.5 and a PE of 2. Best case scenario, they have already started buying stock and they manage to buy most of what they are allowed to.\n\nTo add to this, the stock is so shorted that any positive news, even if of smaller magnitude of what I highlighted, might cause a short squeeze and send the stock flying.\n\nWorst case scenario nothing of this happens, you are getting a stock for a PE of 3, that is projected to continue being profitable for at least 2020 due to new consoles release, that lasts maybe 3 to 4 more years. Improvements to operations such as closing stores might add to the cash and improve profits on the short term. Cash that can be used to redistribute to shareholders.\n\nGiven all of this, I can only imagine the type of idiot that shorted this at $3 a month ago.\n\nIn short yes, there is risk to buying this stock, but it has the potential for a massive upside if management actually starts working in distributing profits to shareholders.", "created_utc": 1569312714, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d8k4g7/why_you_are_getting_burned_by_gme/", "is_self": true}
