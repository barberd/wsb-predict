I think NRZ is one of the better ones and they\u2019re taking steps to secure their future.  NRZ hit $4.61 on March 18th.  It bounced up to $8.91 by March 20th.  That\u2019s a 93.28% gain.  It hit $4.57 on March 24th.  It bounced to $7.89 by March 26th.  That\u2019s a 72.65% gain.  Right now it's $4.36.  Where will it be in two days?  Even if it only bounces 50% that\u2019s $6.55.  Calls for 4/17 are dirt cheap right now as the stock is at an all-time low, and, unlike a lot of others, it has decent volume.  \n\nSome other info from Seeking Alpha \u2013 \n\n> Updating his estimates to reflect the times and the latest information disclosed by New Residential (NYSE:NRZ), BTIG bull Giuliano Bologna cuts his price target to $10.50 from $18. That's still way more than a double from the current $4.33 (down another 13.7% today).\n\n> Bologna does expect increasing dividends following this quarter's $0.05. He sees $0.10 in Q3 and $0.20 in Q4. In 2021, He expects $0.25 per quarter, well below his full-year operating earnings estimate of $1.42.\n\n> Bologna takes note of NRZ's \"differentiation\" to other mREITs, particularly exposure to businesses able to generate counter-cyclical, capital-light earnings.\n\nOf course past performance doesn't ensure future results.  We're staring down the barrel of a major bear market.  I'm 95% in puts myself.  I just think there's money to be made here.  I made the same play last time they dipped and it printed.  Hoping to ride the wave again.  \n\nNRZ 5c 4/17, NRZ 6c 4/17, LYFT 21p 5/1, LYFT 17.5p 5/15, UBER 20p 5/1, SPY 195p 5/1, LQD $110p 5/15, SHO 5p 6/19", "created_utc": 1585774085.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ft8b86/i_think_nrz_calls_are_a_smart_short_term_play/", "is_self": true}
