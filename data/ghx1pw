{"id": "ghx1pw", "title": "BCRX DD possible Coronavirus Antiviral and HAE drug", "selftext": "BCRX has been on a big run this last month and is up over 107% at the time of me writing this so I decided to do some research on it and here is what I found. (TLDR at end)\n\n**Overview / Corona Drug**\n\nBioCryst specializes in antivirals and has recently been focusing on a HAE treatment that has been going well. However, they are testing one of their drugs Galidesivir, a coronavirus treatment that is starting to be compared to Remdesivir. Testing started in April in Brazil so we can expect to see data in the next coming weeks and if successful could be a huge catalyst. Galidesivir could be a more convenient and accessible treatment if tests go well because it is an orally administered drug whereas Remdesivir is a IV administered drug. Orally administered drugs are much more convenient because patients do not need to be in the hospital. This would greatly reduce the risk for all parties involved and could also help ease the load on hospitals for the milder cases. They also had a successful anti viral flu drug Peramivir.\n\n**Government Deal**\n\nIt was announced that the company received $82 million in federal funding which was said in their earnings call which could be a good sign but also could mean nothing as the government has been throwing money around like it is literal TP.\n\nTranscript below\n\n\\*But I think the three things that I talked about before are the three things that we're currently actively working with the government on, the testing of this specific strain of virus with Galidesivir, the second is understanding how to participate in clinical trials, testing it in humans would be very helpful to the advancement of our program and so we're evaluating that. And then the third is, increasing drug supply.\\*\n\n**HAE Treatment**\n\nIn February it was announced their once a day oral drug berotralstat accepted and filed as a new drug application by the FDA for prevention of HAE attacks. Their next PDUFA date is December 3rd and the market opportunity for this drug is approx > 500 million according to them. I\u2019m not gonna take the time to explain what HAE is but just know it sucks. If you don\u2019t believe me just search up a picture.\n\n**Shorts being covered?**\n\nTypically the short volume is sizable on this company but I have seen people saying shorts are being covered but I don\u2019t want to pay for peep shows at information like that so I can\u2019t confirm it.\n\n**Volume is up**\n\nVolume is up lol take that however you want to.\n\n**Who owns this Stuff?**\n\nLike most of you, I haven\u2019t heard of this stock before last week. I may have seen it here or there but nothing out of the ordinary. So who owns this shit then? Here's a breakdown:\n\n0.95% held by Insiders\n\n90.2% Held by Institutions (Rumors of up to 95%)\n\nLeaving about 9% to retail investors (low of 4%)\n\nNotable holders\n\nBlackrock Inc. 8.68%\n\nBaker Brothers\n\n7.10%\n\nMillennium Management\n\n6.44%\n\nJanus Henderson Group\n\n6.10%\n\nPoint 72 Asset Management\n\n6.44%\n\nVangaurd Group\n\n5.26%\n\n**Why this matters**\n\nWhat you or I do means jack squat in respect to moving this company meaning this month's run up was most likely due to institutions picking up more shares. It also means it will be harder to pick up if institutions choose to hold, meaning it could drive up the price.\n\n**Financials**\n\n\\[10-K\\]([https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/Stock/BCRX/SecFilings?subview=secarticle&sid=8556&guid=14004797&type=1](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/Stock/BCRX/SecFilings?subview=secarticle&sid=8556&guid=14004797&type=1))\n\nNever been profitable since inception but it doesn\u2019t look like they will be going bankrupt anytime soon.(I think? I\u2019m still learning how to read these walls of text so don\u2019t take my word for it)\n\nI couldn\u2019t find a credit agreement but I\u2019m also kinda retarded\n\n**TLDR**: BCRX **COULD** make a big run as their HAE treatment looks promising and if Galidesvir is successful it could go crazy. Institutions are the ones that own this and it looks like they are either picking up more or holding.\n\nI personally picked up calls Friday and plan on holding them for a bit.\n\n\\*Disclaimer\\* I am just a random guy on WSB and am still learning myself so take my DD with a grain of salt. This is not financial advice.\n\nChanged title\n\nStonks go up, stonks go down no matter what you do the market will dick you down.\n\n\\[Ownership Breakdown\\]([https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/bcrx/holders?ltr=1](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/bcrx/holders?ltr=1))\n\n\\[Earnings Call Transcript\\] ([https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/03/05/biocryst-pharmaceuticals-inc-bcrx-q4-2019-earnings.aspx](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/03/05/biocryst-pharmaceuticals-inc-bcrx-q4-2019-earnings.aspx))", "created_utc": 1589233081.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghx1pw/bcrx_dd_possible_coronavirus_antiviral_and_hae/", "is_self": true}
