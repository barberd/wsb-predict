{"id": "gqxzu6", "title": "Do the $DOOO", "selftext": "Summary: Powersports is likely one of the places vacation/recreation dollars are/have been being redirected, with things like movie theaters, bars, national parks, theme parks, cruises, and flights only slowly coming back online or coming back with restrictions.  [As noted in a fund's report from April on boat/engine maker Brunswick](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insights-white-brook-capital-2020-174805036.html), any savings that would have been allocated to vacations involving flying, cruise ships, theme parks, etc. are probably being spent on other big-ticket purchases instead.\n\nWhich big-ticket items?  Well, ORVs/watercraft are one category:\n**Search interest for off-road vehicles- things like ATVs, UTVs/side-by-sides- all of which are seeing spikes of ~2X-4X YoY search activity and ~2X ATHs.  Personal watercraft, i.e. jet skis, are seeing similar spikes.  Small watercraft related search terms are also at ATHs or seeing above-average or on-trend activity levels.**\n\nKey players in this space are Bombardier Recreational Products (BRP, $DOOO), maker of Can-Am ORVs, Sea-Doo PWCs, Evinrude outboard motors, Alumacraft small boats, etc; Polaris ($PII), make of Polaris ORVs as well as several small watercraft brands; and Brunswick Corporation, which makes Mercury outboard motors and a range of watercraft, including Boston Whaler, Lowe Boats, and the more upscale Sea Ray.\n\nI had been eyeing this play, particularly for Polaris, and in fact I [identified this play a month ago but paper-handed my calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gafwlq/outdoor_recreational_vehicle_stocks_are_actually/).  More recently I was waiting for a bit of a pullback since PII is already pretty close to ATH.  Unfortunately Polaris jumped up even more last week against the market trend, to $83, about 11% off its February high of $93 (it has been as high as $101 last December).  In researching this play this weekend I found out why $PII bounced up on May 20: an article, (some paras pasted below) that went out in an industry publication on that date.\n\n>[**OEM\u2019s April dirt bike sales double with half of its dealers open**](https://powersportsbusiness.com/top-stories/2020/05/20/oems-april-dirt-bike-sales-double-with-half-of-its-dealers-open/)\n\n>\u201cIt started off rocky at first but then business took off. I\u2019ve never sold as many machines before in a month as we did in April,\u201d said Mac Johnston, owner of East Central Sports, which has locations in North Branch, Burnsville and Rush City, Minnesota, offering a wide range of powersports vehicles and service. Its Burnsville Mall location is currently appointment-only. \u201cWe\u2019re over double from what we\u2019ve sold during a normal month last year; May is looking pretty good too.\u201d\n\n>\u201cMost of our customers are still at work,\u201d said John Churchman, owner of Shore Cycles in Salisbury, Maryland, offering pre-owned ATVs and motorcycles as well as youth bikes and ATVs. **\u201cWe are in a rural area relatively speaking and most people still have jobs, which is a big piece of the puzzle;** they\u2019re working hard and buying what they\u2019ve earned \u2014 giving their kids or themselves something to do while they have any downtime, and the kids are at home. School has been out since mid-March, generally speaking, and they\u2019re home the rest of the school year. They have the opportunity to give their kid a gift that lasts many years, and gets them out of the house.\u201d\n\n>We don\u2019t sell many youth products after Christmas until the next fall; there are a few here and there, but that\u2019s not what the focus is. This year it has been a complete 180, and they have been the primary volume of our new vehicle sales,\u201d said Churchman. \u201cPeople are at home and they\u2019re shifting their focus on what they\u2019re spending money on. **A lot of customers who have bought stuff have bought it because they\u2019re not taking a summer vacation this year \u2014 their spending has shifted into a different product. People are looking for alternative ways to entertain their families.\u201d**\n\n>**\u201cSales have been strong. We have a lot of dealers in rural areas, and it didn\u2019t seem like sales slowed at all,\u201d** Cruz told Powersports Business. \u201cBallard Golf and Power in Hayden, Idaho, told us that their sales have been incredible. We also spoke to another dealer in Missouri that said sales have been triple what they\u2019ve expected.\u201d\n\n>**\u201cLast year April was our biggest invoicing month, and this year our sales were double what they were in April of last year,\u201d** said Mel Harris, vice president of operations with SSR, which produces motorcycles, pit bikes, dirt bikes, scooters, side-by-sides, ATVs, mopeds and more. **\u201cAnd that\u2019s with less than 50 percent of our dealers operating.\u201d**\n\n>**\u201cThis year we\u2019re already ahead of the last full calendar year, and it\u2019s only April,\u201d Fay said. \u201cSales have been doubling, if not tripling month-to-month.** People are trying to get the kids out of the house because they\u2019re glued to their screens. As soon as those [stimulus] checks went out, sales spiked like crazy.\u201d\n\n>\u201cThe only slowdown we\u2019re seeing is regional,\u201d said Harris. \u201cIn places it gets too hot, people will head out on the water instead of in the dirt. But we don\u2019t expect to see a drop-off in the fall. In fact, we\u2019ll have new product coming out.\u201d\n\n\nSo, how to play this?  $DOOO (BRP) has earnings on Thursday 5/28 before market open. Unfortunately, there are no options available for $DOOO, but its stock is still 42% down from its February high, so owning shares may not be a bad way to approach this.\n\nHowever, buying June calls for $PII might be a way to play $DOOO options by proxy.  Polaris reported earnings in April, and they were summarizing more of the initial COVID downturn.  You can also see more of a dip for many Polaris searches which isn't there for BRP.  So if $DOOO reports a month of big sales toward the end of the period, Wall St may have heard enough to send Polaris right back up to February highs by June.  (If this crazy pump doesn't do it first that is.)\n\nOne issue here is volume.  Don't buy FDs and expect to be able to offload them due to a spike in IV.  The bid-ask spread may be larger than you'd want, but it's not a showstopper.\n\nPositions: \n\n$PII 6/19 85c\n\n$DOOO shares\n\n$BC 6/19 50c\n\nCharts as of Friday:\n\n[BC Corp 1YR chart](https://i.imgur.com/yILVMSb.png)\n\n[BRP Corp 1YR chart](https://i.imgur.com/dOMdzrs.png)\n\n[Polaris 1YR chart](https://i.imgur.com/Nq8gz3N.png)\n\nGoogle search trend data below.\n\n---\n\n[Conditional formatting of powersports Google trends scores](https://i.imgur.com/h0VsXrP.png).

I think this is interesting, because the ORVs/PWCs tend to be more family and group-focused, and also have utility in hunting (meat shortage...).  So this again reinforces this is one place families have redirected vacation-type spending, as motorcycling is often more of a solitary or competitive activity if it's not being done for commuting.  It's not just that people are at home googling dream purchases.\n\n---\n\nTl;dr who the fuck knows if individual stock DD/earnings even matters with today's market, but if you're looking for a reason to buy anything today, this is probably as good as any.", "created_utc": 1590503092.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gqxzu6/do_the_dooo/", "is_self": true}
