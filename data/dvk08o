It takes a MINIMUM of 15 minutes for my options sales to get executed, today it took 3 hours! Not only that but while your order has been placed robinhood allows for the price of your option to still fluctuate. So has your call or put reached its peak and you wanna sell it?! Well get ready to wait for our trade to execute and watch your % gained go down down and down. I\u2019m officially moving to Ameritrade! \n\nNow hear me out before you BR my asshole you autistic retards. I\u2019m going to list benefits that Ameritrade has that robinhood doesn\u2019t have.\n\n-24/7 customer service\n-24/5 hour after hours trading\n- FREE online courses for options, futures and stocks that would otherwise cost money.\n- The best execution system in the world.\n- A Fiduciary obligation to its customers \n\nAnd it also offers commission FREE trading.\n\nNow look, they don\u2019t have an infinite leverage glitch so it might not be for all you retards who wanna go 50k + debt by the time you\u2019re 20 years old. But if you\u2019re tired of being fucked by robinhood follow me! Go to Schwab, E-Trade, anything but robinhood!! Fuck them!", "created_utc": 1573607602, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dvk08o/done_with_rh_moving_to_ameritrade/", "is_self": true}
