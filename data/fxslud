{"id": "fxslud", "title": "ARWR - Primed for The Breakout of The Century", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nSome of you may remember me from [This Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dv83sb/arwr_will_be_the_next_top_pharmaceutical_company/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) where I talked about ARWR when it was sitting around $40 before it broke out and hit an ATH of $73 in the same month. I am back again to inform you that $ARWR is much more developed and undervalued than before. Since my previous post, they have added 2 more drugs and announced a secondary filing in December which raised them $250m in cash. I\u2019ve been following this company for years and it\u2019s been under constant manipulation. Institutions are acquiring shares (65% Institutional ownership) while holding price steady. ARWR is primed for its next breakout which will be incomparable to before and this is why.\n\n# Who are they?\n\nArrowhead Pharmaceuticals is a clinical stage company that is developing cures for diseases through RNA interference. In this specific mechanism a targeted gene is suppressed which affects the production of a certain protein curing the disease.\n\n# RNAi Worth\n\nTo properly evaluate Arrowhead we must first establish how much a single FDA approved RNAi drug is worth. In November of 2019, Novartis, a global healthcare company, agreed to buy Medicines Co. and its RNAi heart drug for $9.7 billion. When looking at other RNAi companies such as Alnylam we can estimate that an FDA approved RNAi drug is worth between $3-9 billion. [Novartis Deal](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-24/novartis-agrees-to-buy-medicines-co-in-6-8-billion-deal)\n\n# ARWR's Pipeline\n\nArrowhead has the best in class TRIM platform for RNAi. Currently they have 9 RNAi drugs in clinical trials with a 10th expected by the end of 2020. Of these 7 are wholly owned while two are in collaboration with Amgen and JNJ. With this stellar pipeline ARWR is only at a 2.66B market cap, extremely undervalued. [Pipeline](https://imgur.com/a/sgBh9QU)\n\n# The Data\n\nArrowhead has recently released top of the line data for their Hepatitis B drug (ARO-HBV) and their cardiometabolic drugs (APOC3 & ANG3). This data is extremely good and incomparable to competitors drugs showing the power of the TRIM platform. \n\n\\* ARO-APOC3 appears to be best in class by far with super efficacy even at low dose. Should get breakthrough designation by FDA for FCS and hypertriglyceridemia. IMO, considering what Novartis paid for Inclisiran, it will probably be worth $5 billion once data is reported in June/July. Please do your DD and check out eye popping top line data for ARO-APOC3. [Data](http://ir.arrowheadpharma.com/news-releases/news-release-details/arrowhead-reports-interim-clinical-data-cardiometabolic)\n\n\\* ARO-HBV Hepatitis B drug which is dominating the race to a cure. [Data](http://wap.ulabmed.com/content-134-5342-1.html.%C2%A0)\n\n\\* ARO-AAT treats liver diseases and with the P2/3 data release ARWR will be worth over $100. [Data](https://imgur.com/a/h2NWcCK)\n\nThere is no biotech that will top ARWR\u2019s data of ARO-HBV, ARO-AAT, and ARO-APOC3. The results are just off the charts good and all are home runs. Expecting the same with ARO-HSD, ARO-HIF2 and ARO-ENaC. This is THE opportunity to BUY in my humble opinion.\n\n# Cash\n\nOne of the biggest problems for biotechs is cash. Fortunately for ARWR they had a secondary equity offering at $58 in December of 2019 raising about 250m in cash. They currently have $450m+ cash which is enough to operate through this pandemic and about 4-5 years into the future.\n\n# New Facility\n\nIn March, ARWR announced the addition of their new 21,000 sq/ft facility in San Diego. Coincidentally, Johnson and Johnson, who ARWR\u2019s HBV drug is partnered to, have their research and development center nearby. The partnership with JNJ means they own the rights to three more ARWR RNAi indications/targets that JNJ must perform pre-clinical on. They are most likely going to perform this research in San Diego while they partner with another ARWR indication that is proven safe, effective, and already in the clinic. JNJ has already had a peak under the hood and knows what they own. It\u2019s what we don't know that holds the greatest value. [New Facility](https://imgur.com/a/gZGBj5V)\n\n# Hiring Employees\n\nVery recently ARWR has been hiring tons of new employees including three new positions on their career board. All Senior Vice President of marketing/market access positions. They first bring in a head of commercialization and then begin building the professional marketing staff. The requirements include preferred experience in CV, pulmonary, oncology or rare disease. This sounds like the company\u2019s development pipeline. Currently on ARWR\u2019s career site there are 34 jobs, the most there\u2019s ever been. A company would not hire for these positions if they did not have an idea how well the drugs work or are going to work.

Functional cures will start to be announced as trials continue to progress. Biotech pharma is going to have one of the biggest rebounds of any sector. People will be more informed about viruses and take interest in investing in results. Supply chains will come home creating millions of USA jobs, FDA is getting streamlined to move rapid good results. $ARWR will be between $100-$200 by year end.\n\n# TLDR \n\nARWR goes big uppies very soon. Here is a very good report on the company that I highly recommend looking through. It talks about all the drugs, clinical studies, and future expectations. [Read](https://arrowheadpharma.gcs-web.com/static-files/b033c528-1e07-42e2-ba7f-30136d96f2a7) By year end ARWR will have 10 products in trials as they have stated. Every single one of these drugs has billion dollar sales potential and possibly much more than that. ARWR has also mentioned that they see 20 drugs in trials in the not too distant future. This is in an incredible company that is worth much more than $3billion and as time goes on this gold mine will slowly be discovered. \n\n**To include most data releases and based on price targets I would recommend calls**   \n\n**June 19 $50 & $60**       \n\n**Jan 15, 2021 $105**", "created_utc": 1586439658.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxslud/arwr_primed_for_the_breakout_of_the_century/", "is_self": true}
