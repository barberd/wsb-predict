{"id": "h7v9ci", "title": "Fat Finger your way to Gains!", "selftext": "So my investment portfolio was recently sold to Schwab.   \nI do all my research/stock watching on the TD Ameritrade platform.  \n\n\nSaw an opportunity earlier this week and rolled the dice on ROKU options, and made a quick 30K.  \n\n\nTook that 30K and immediately put it into Amazon Calls (2660) on Wenesday Morning.  The Schwab Mobile platform was new to me, and I remember having some  hiccups buying (research said price was \\~28, but I had no sellers, so upped the price to 32.).\n\nWatched as news broke that EU might start anti trust.... amazon started tanking.  \n\n\nThen Corona fear hit... started tanking further...  \n\n\nFriday rolls around, and Amazon is -$100.    I write that $30K off as a goner.  \n\n\nAt 1430, Schwab calls and says I have expiring options....  No shit.  The guy on the phone says \"Looks like that worked out pretty well for you, congratulations\"  \n\n\nWHAT??  \n\n\nCheck my account.... I somehow bought a Put instead of a call.   I have never bought a Put in my life.   I don't guess when stocks will tank.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o0h4owcl8k451.png?width=1884&format=png&auto=webp&s=4649d4f9a9763d42acd46de82119572725dab4b6", "created_utc": 1592002980.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h7v9ci/fat_finger_your_way_to_gains/", "is_self": true}
