{"id": "h8xzgg", "title": "T STOCK - Abnormal OI/Volume", "selftext": "I like to screen for volume/OI on options with low IV and noticed something with At&T stock. The weeklies have ridiculous amounts of volume and OI on various strikes. The 31 strike has 16k OI with 2k volume while the 32 strike has over 22k OI with 2k volume... wtf?\n\nThere were reported rumors on Friday that AT&T was going to sell their WB gaming business for 4 billion which would help their debt. Is this a bet on an agreement coming this week? IV is only 38%. Seems like a nice risk/reward play", "created_utc": 1592156031.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h8xzgg/t_stock_abnormal_oivolume/", "is_self": true}
