Brad Pitt or Matt Damon or Leo DiCaprio or whatever is name is (all look the same in any case) goes up to da Moon.\n\nHere is where it gets exciting. They have a full on colony up there. Multiple nations. Buildings the size of malls. Shops. Even pirates. Can you imagine the number of ships and flights it must have taken to get the shit up there? Here is the kicker, $125 for blanket and pillow on the flight. Say what?! And the flight is operated by... Virgin Galactic.\n\nYou think that\u2019s good? He carries on... to Mars. Another colony, albeit smaller. Underground tunnels. More space crafts. $$$\n\nFrom there, on to Neptune. Yes, you read that right. Neptune. \ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\n\nThe stock is so undervalued it\u2019s not even funny. While recognising that SpaceX is a competitor, those are more focused on government contracts which is where things go wrong as evidenced by the movie. Virgin operates the commercial flights which are smooth as anything.\n\nI fully expect this stock to hit $20 in pre market, $50 within a week once more people have downloaded the movie, and $1000+ by month end.\n\nDisclaimer: Unfortunately option markets were closed by the time I finished the movie but I am long the stock.", "created_utc": 1581118255, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f0iz4z/spce_full_dd_to_neptune/", "is_self": true}
