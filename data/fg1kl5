It doesn't really matter how you want to make money as long as you buy puts like a real autist. \n\nUSA is probably on the same scale as europe but is too stupid to realise it. They will start to put lockdowns in approx 2 weeks but they will get obliterated (I'm speaking of millions infected simmilar to swineflu). \n\nJust dont go full autismo 1 or 2 days will always be green be it fed cutting rates or boomers being boomers.", "created_utc": 1583786902.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fg1kl5/tomorrow_will_be_red_dd_inside_italy_full_lockdown/", "is_self": true}
