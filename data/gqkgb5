A lot of small businesses have been shut down and are forced to lay off workers\n\n\\----The other crisis is the Wall Street crisis, but arguably even more important is the $100 trillion credit market because no one wants to lend in these uncertain times.\n\n**FED** **& U.S Treasury**\n\nBasically from Main Street to Wall Street people need money. Incoming the FED. To solve these 2 crises, the FED\u2019s plan is to print money. Incoming, the U.S. Treasury. Also, technically it\u2019s not money. It's just currency because it's based on debt not value. While it\u2019s crazy the FED is allowed to just create money out of thin air, my point here is that the Fed will be printing trillions of dollars.\n\nEnter Quantitative Easing (technical term for printing massive amounts of money. Here\u2019s the FED chairman of MN, Neel Kashkari \u201c [there is an infinite amount of cash in the Federal Reserve](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-23/coronavirus-fed-s-infinite-cash-tested-in-world-of-leverage). We will do whatever we need to do to make sure that there's enough cash in the banking system.\u201d WTH!!!\n\nThe Fed has a mandate from the US government; maximize employment, keep prices stable, and keep interest rates moderate. So ever since the Fed was created more than 100 years ago it added or removed the money from the economy, mostly in small quantities to keep prices stable over time; though the Fed has ended up adding a huge amount of money which is why we have inflation. [Here\u2019s the US Money Supply M2](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/money-supply-m2) last 25 years. From $286B to now $17,176B in 25 years.\n\n**Inflations & Hyper-inflation.**\n\nIn theory as more money gets added to the economy, prices go up because each dollar buys less. In reality it's more complicated because the population grows, and because new dollars don't get spread evenly throughout the economy.\n\nPeople in the US have gotten used to gradual inflation in consumer prices usually about 2% a year. The Fed has worked hard to maintain this moderate rate of inflation for decades. Even moderate inflation comes with its own problems.\n\nWhat nobody wants is hyperinflation. That's what happens when the central bank prints too much money too fast. That happened in the [paradise of Venezuela](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevehanke/2019/01/01/venezuelas-hyperinflation-hits-80000-per-year-in-2018/#56c0c89f4572). Corruption and stupid government policies wrecked the economy. Eventually, the government couldn't raise enough their taxes so they just printed more currency to pay for stuff. That made the value of the Venezuelan currency plunged. At its peak inflation, reached more than a million percent. The well educated and once middle-class were wiped out to the point [it\u2019s cheaper to use cash than toilet paper.](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2018/08/in-venezuela-it-s-cheaper-to-use-cash-than-toilet-paper.html)\n\n**QE \u2013 a history lesson 2008**\n\nFederal Reserve is aware of this danger. Doing quantitative easing or QE is risky. The Fed has done several QE injections before. From 2008 to 2011 they eased about $4 trillion new dollars into the economy to deal with some of the fallout from the recession.\n\nThe good news was consumers did not see massive inflation, [the consumer price index,](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/24/the-fed-launched-qe-nine-years-ago--these-four-charts-show-its-impact.html) which tracks the prices of consumer saw a roughly normal amount of inflation 1 to 2% year which means prices increased by just under 19% over the last 11 years.\n\nThe bad news was some prices don't get tracked by the consumer price index. I'm talking about asset prices like the stock market, high-end art, and other thing rich people investing in.\n\nQE did cause [inflation and asset prices massive inflation](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/where-is-inflation-hiding-in-asset-prices/). [The US stock market grew by a whopping 225](https://mises.org/wire/fed-driven-asset-price-inflation-means-you-can-now-buy-less-house-you-could)% in 11 years. All that happened because of the way the Fed did their QE.\n\nWhen the Fed printed money out of thin air, they used it to buy assets whose prices have fallen things like stocks, corporate bonds, collateralized debt obligations which included home mortgage loans repackaged in complex ways. The value of all those assets had balloons before 2008 and then the balloons popped.\n\nWhen the Fed did QE, it pumped new money specifically into those assets. Between 2008 and 2011 the Fed printed about $4 trillion of new currency which again ended up inflating asset prices but not really the price of consumer goods.\n\nSo people who already had enough money to invest in stocks and other assets got richer, while everyone else stayed roughly the same. And that's one reason why the wealth gap in the US has increased. Just look at the gap [from 201 to 2016](https://apps.urban.org/features/wealth-inequality-charts/).\n\n**COVID 19**\n\nNow with the 2020 coronavirus, the Fed doing multiple rounds of quantitative easing. [They've already announced $700 billion in bond purchases](https://abcnews.go.com/US/federal-reserve-slashes-rates-launches-700-billion-quantitative/story?id=69610447) and by the time this economic crisis is over, [Total QE could be in the ballpark of $5 trillion.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/upshot/coronavirus-fed-extraordinary-response.html)\n\nIt's 20 times more than the $250 billion given to individuals in the stimulus checks. Of course the stimulus checks are not from the Fed. Those checks are part of the government's recent $2 trillions stimulus package, but ultimately it's all to be paid for by printing money.\n\nWith this new QE, the Fed has to be careful or we could see the same kind of asset inflation we saw a decade ago, which mainly help the rich get richer while everyone else's money lost value.\n\nBut\u2026\u2026. \u201c it\u2019s different this time.\n\n**FED bailing out:**\n\n[I\u2019ll summarized: ](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200323b.htm)Here\u2019s what the FED\u2019s buying:\n\n1.) Treasury Securities -basically government bonds and that keeps interest rates low\n\n2.) Mortgage-backed securities( repackaging of real estate mortgages which led to massive problems in 2008, but\u2026\u2026 this time it\u2019s different ( being sarcastic).\n\n3.) corporate bonds, basically the debt of large corporations. So this is a type of Wall Street bailout\n\n4.) Exchange-traded funds, which are listed on the stock market, which is another type of Wall Street bailout meant to make the stock market go back up.\n\nSo all that sounds roughly the same as a decade ago. But as they say, if you do the same thing over and over again \u201cIt will be different this time I swear\u201d.\n\n5.) But the Fed has some new programs [this time to using QE to support states and citie](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/09/fed-to-buy-municipal-debt-178222)s that need to quickly raise money by issuing bonds.

U.S Treasury\u2019s Mnuchin is Trump\u2019s guy. I got a bridge to sell you if you think Trump is going to let Wall Street tank before the election.\n\n2.)
