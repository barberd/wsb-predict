Trump has got Wall Street by the balls, hook-line-and-sinker, on this opaque 'phases' idea. Like feening addict, Wall Street loooooves 'phases' almost as much as it loves shitty cocaine.\n\nFor example the trade deal with China-- Trump always touted we're in phase 1 of working on a deal and the markets were jolted a little. Then a couple months would go by and things would start to look hairy with the market down a little and he'd state \"we're close to wrapping up phase 1\".  And when things got iffy again and the market dropped a couple more points 6 months later all of sudden BOOM he'd state \"we've wrapped up phase 1 and are now on to phase 2.\" And just like the suckers we all are we would eat it up and the headlines would state \"markets would rally on good news of the trade deal\"\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-markets/stocks-rally-on-preliminary-u-s-china-trade-deal-oil-rises-idUSKBN1YK01P](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-markets/stocks-rally-on-preliminary-u-s-china-trade-deal-oil-rises-idUSKBN1YK01P)\n\nFast forward to the present-- we now have a 3 phase plan to re-open the economy. The news is going to continue to be bad and there might even be a second wave of coronavirus infections.  Hundreds of thousands more might perish, millions more losing their jobs. But, let it be known: a second wave doesn't stand a chance against phase 2. Markets will rally on some bullshit news and nobody will have any clue. Just be weary out there fellow austists and remember-- don't fight the fed or the phases.\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks/wall-street-climbs-on-boeing-trumps-reopening-plan-idUSKBN21Z1ED](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks/wall-street-climbs-on-boeing-trumps-reopening-plan-idUSKBN21Z1ED)", "created_utc": 1587152227.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g38vq6/dont_fight_the_phases/", "is_self": true}
