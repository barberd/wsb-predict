Going into the June futures contract expiry, I was *certain* there would be another oil crash. How could it not after what happened with the May contract? Here's what I discovered from [a random Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/JKempEnergy) (not my account, I'm not that smart):\n\n* As many of us know now, there was a record number of shut-ins and a [significant reduction in output](https://twitter.com/JKempEnergy/status/1261289638498533376).\n* There was coordination by the CME and [CFTC to ensure smooth rollover](https://twitter.com/JKempEnergy/status/1260862999893553152).\n* There was a [coordinated attempt by brokers and clearing houses to prevent participation](https://twitter.com/JKempEnergy/status/1261217311018618886) and encourage early withdrawal in the futures market.\n* Saudi tankers off the US coast were asked to not dump the oil on Cushing.\n* I read somewhere (can't find it now) that there was an increase in refinery storage (I think meaning ~~more~~ less crude left to be refined).\n* Lastly, [short sellers were squeezed](https://twitter.com/JKempEnergy/status/1262296974642085889) of course due to the low amount of longs remaining and [were forced to buy back higher](https://twitter.com/JKempEnergy/status/1261216570946224130).\n\nSo perhaps an unconventional amount of \"control\" over this rollover prevented a similar drop in WTI and the oil situation is still not completely resolved (i.e. reduced demand is still greater than reduced supply), however it's also highly likely to be further scrutinized/controlled for at least the next contract expiry.\n\nPostions: ~~USO 6/19 16p~~, STNG 6/19 25c, STNG stocks", "created_utc": 1590090989.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/go3z1q/info_on_most_recent_oil_futures_rollover_and_why/", "is_self": true}
