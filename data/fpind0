No one understands the meaning of lurking anymore and the daily is flooded with retarded people. The witch fiasco, now this unemployment shit. Why are you all surprised that a conclusion reached by people who give 5k upvotes to a copy pasted Investopedia page explaining what the Greeks are is wrong? WSB may once have been one step ahead of the normies, but these days WSB itself has become those thinking they are outsmarting the normies despite being normies themselves. \n\nNo, spamming autistic shit like BEAR GANG and DRILL TEAM 6 in dailies will not make your 4/3 150p print, you are not bear gang, you are retarded.\n\nThink how stupid the average person is, and remind yourself that the average WSB user falls far under that mean. No, you did not discover top secret insider info about rising unemployment rates, you are not a genius for coming to the conclusion 1 day before the announcement that the market could tank from this info. If even a troglodyte could reach a conclusion, the market has reached that conclusion a long long time ago.", "created_utc": 1585253376.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpind0/you_all_arent_bulls_or_bears_youre_a_sheep/", "is_self": true}
