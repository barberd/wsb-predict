{"id": "e68vhv", "title": "BIIB DD", "selftext": "Fellow autists, I had the pleasure of catching a Alzheimer\u2019s segment on the local NBC station this evening. They had some doctor talking about the BIIB study that is set to come out tomorrow. Here are the key points:\n\n- This is not a cure, rather it delays the symptoms long term, offering a higher quality of life\n\n- The longer you\u2019re on the medication, the stronger effect the drug has. This is why the studies were originally scrapped earlier this year. At first, the drug appears to have no impact, but after a while they did find some evidence of the drug working as intended\n\n- If approved by the FDA, the hope is to have the drug available within the next year\n\n- I also saw somewhere that the estimated additional revenue of an FDA approval is around $10 Billion annually\n\nUse this info at your disposal. Hopefully, someday Autism will get the same kind of attention.\n\nGUH", "created_utc": 1575505899, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e68vhv/biib_dd/", "is_self": true}
