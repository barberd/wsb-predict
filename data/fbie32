It sounds crazy I know but they will trade at a 2X FE at $11 and I dont think that they can go down much further from there, I dont see airlines going under in this scenario, even if we get worse from here. However, I believe that they have another 15-20% room to run to the downside, even though they have been analed the last 2 weeks.\n\nTLDR: I think airlines will eventually be a buy, but I dont know when, im curious about the opinion of this sub.", "created_utc": 1583007468, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbie32/airlins_stonks_specifically_aal/", "is_self": true}
