{"id": "h99tno", "title": "SLV Options A Vehicle To Economic Prosperity And Insanity", "selftext": "As we go into another week of unpredictable markets I want you to think about the reasons you should **buy call options on the SLV ETF** **for a 36 USD strike in January 2021**.\n\nSilver in its bullion form is less common than gold, while estimates of above ground bullion vary there is likely between 2-3 billion ounces of silver bars and coins. The mining ratio of silver to gold is currently 9-1 while the estimated reserves in the earth crust is 17-1. Silver is rarely found in concentrated deposits like gold except in a few places, this is one of the reasons that should silver rise in value it will take some time for mining to catch up with demand. Additionally, since silver\u2019s USD value is still the same as it was in the 80s **without** adjusting for inflation, it is difficult to keep mines profitable so many have closed.\n\nSilver\u2019s primary consumption comes from industrial use, until the 00s the majority demand came from photo chemistry, but now photovoltaic cells, computers, and electronics take most quantities. Since Silver is the most conductive element for both heat and electrons, there will continue to be industrial demand for silver even when prices rise.\n\nHistorically governments like the US would carry stockpiles of silver as they did gold but in the 80s and 90s the US government sold their stockpile to industry, this same sell-off has occurred for many countries. As more and more silver has been used for industry much of it has been \u201cconsumed\u201d and is now dispersed in ways that are unrecoverable or in landfills. It is difficult to find out how much silver has been depleted but it is estimated that there were over 5 billion ounces of silver bullion in the 1960s above ground and we know there is much less today due to industry use. Additionally, easy to extract deposits have slowly been producing less silver per ton of rock processed, so every year there is a higher cost to mining meanwhile silver continues to have less purchasing power since the 1980s.\n\nStepping away from silver for a moment let's talk about the macro situation facing United States citizens. While most people do not talk about it everyone knows the United States reaps great benefit from the USD being the world reserve currency. This reserve status is written into western central bank laws that until recently could only back their fractional reserve banking system with USD and US treasuries. Now under the Basel III accords central banks will be able to fully back their reserve banking systems with gold which is bullish for precious metals.\n\nWhile the USD is still the main world reserve currency, the national debt has been able to double every 10 years for nearly fifty years while the purchasing power of the dollar remains steady. This means that even though China produces much of the physical goods consumed in the world, and while the US has a trade deficit with most countries, you wouldn\u2019t know it because the US dollar can still purchase a ton of real physical commodities. One of the big reasons the government debt can keep increasing is because dollar denominated debt across the world is increasing; as the US inflates the money supply it actually helps states within its alliances so that they can pay down their dollar denominated debts. Additionally, the US needs the dollar to weaken so that foreign nations never run into a situation where their own currency cannot purchase dollars to service their dollar debt.\n\nThis last point is really quite important, the Asian financial crisis in the 90s was caused because of a strong dollar, and once again we find the dollar strong as nations across the world are having a hard time servicing their dollar denominated debt; that is unless they have access to dollars through the feds newly created swap lines. These swap lines do two things, they get dollars in the hands of allies that need them, and they help prop up the treasury market which started to fail even before COVID: yes governments across the world stopped buying treasuries before COVID started! The US, much like Japan, can now only find purchasers for its government debt through its central bank which is a terrible situation to be in.\n\nSo today in the midst of COVID, 25-30 million people are without a job if you include PPP workers. In this environment we do not have many options, the government will have to continue to print money as will many governments around the world. This simple situation is bullish for gold price alone but when you factor in the probable collapse of the US dollar, due to the world losing confidence in our currency, then being exposed to precious metals as a US citizen is imperative to your financial safety.\n\nNow why silver over gold? Well I first explained to you the fundamentals for physical silver and demand but what I haven\u2019t talked about is the silver price manipulation in the trading markets. Until 2016 the two markets that controlled silver and gold spot price where the gold fix in England and the COMEX futures trading desk in New York. The London Gold fix has existed for over 100 years while the COMEX was only formed in the 1970s after Nixon closed the gold window and worked with Saudi Arabia to form the petroleum dollar.\n\nThe way the petro dollar works is this, Saudi Arabia only accepts USD for oil and then gives their USD to the bullion banks that steward the COMEX who in turn help Saudi Arabia purchase leasing rights for future precious metals production in mines across the world. Effectively the USD is still backed by gold through this agreement with Saudi Arabia which is now coming to an end. Saudi Arabia is now accepting oil purchases in the Chinese RMB, this is a bad sign for the petro dollar and a reason that the low price of gold in USD cannot continue.\n\nYou see the COMEX future trading desk has been used by the large banks, probably backed by the government, to lower the price of precious metals against the USD so that the petro dollar arrangement with Saudi Arabia can function. This is one of the reasons until six months ago that the price of oil always rose and fell exactly with the dollar. However, in 2016 China started its own spot price market in Shanghai and there is now a Shanghai gold fix. As Saudi Arabia can now buy gold with the Chinese RMB this is one of the big reasons that they are taking RMB as payment for oil. Additionally the Shanghai gold fix gives China some power to control the price of precious metals which they can weaponize should they decide to.\n\nChina, Saudi Arabia, and to a lesser extent Russia, have been hoarding and stockpiling gold for years but not reporting their holdings to the UN or IMF. As such it is very likely that these countries will do quite well once the dollar is no longer the reserve currency. Many western countries outside the classic axis powers (Germany and Italy), France, and Switzerland do not have large gold reserves. In fact Britain sold off half their reserves when Gordon Brown was their PM which will probably go down as the stupidest move in a long history of bad moves, yes the country that started the original gold fix does not own that much of the precious metal. The rest of the English speaking world, except for America, does not have much gold either; Ireland, Canada, and Australia barely have any reserves.\n\nSo do you expect the gold price to rise and are you planning to purchase some exposure? If you say yes then I would have you pay attention to the fact that gold is worth six-seven times what it was in 2001 but silver is still the same USD value that is was in the 80s. Additionally, the amount of money invested in the silver bullion market is a fraction of the gold market, this is at the same time that the bullion banks have short silver positions larger than that of their short positions in gold. Men like Ted Butler have done a good job documenting the shorting of silver over the past 20-30 years, suffice to say it is a fact that the CFTC does not enforce their own rules upon the bullion banks. JPMorgan has had traders of their precious metals desk convicted of felonies in recent years for market manipulation while JPMorgan as also amassed one of the largest silver stock piles in the world.\n\nIf you look at both instances of silver\u2019s historical breakouts in 1980 and 2011, you will see that 20.50 USD is an important resistance point. Once silver crosses this threshold it should move very fast. While you can, you should split your precious metal investments between 50 percent physical silver and call options on the SLV ETF, my recommendation on call options is to buy the highest out the money options for Jan 2021 but roll those options out to a later date if silver has not started moving past 20.50 USD by October or early November. If you are interested in learning more about the large silver price manipulation on the COMEX futures market take a look at the documentation online by Ted Butler, Ed Steer, and Bert Chilton.
