Orange man may have prevented a complete wipeout.", "selftext": "Since the talk of trade wars and selling fighter jets, etc. was salient last week, I expected the market to dip this week at least by Wednesday and so bought some QQQ puts for 8/23. Instead, we\u2019ve had a rally that has been crushing my position. \n\nDid not time the Fed call right (perhaps should\u2019ve bought the call for a Monday or Tuesday in consideration of the \u201cIV crush\u201d or whatever), but I deemed these not worth the cost given my surety of the dip (based on no scientific process here for comparing cost/potential benefit while incorporating strength of belief). \n\nWas close to thinking about selling early but just decided to let it burn if I was flat out wrong. Woke up to find my near zero position jumped to being close to ITM.
