{"id": "f7bqc6", "title": "Why you should be buying $ALLY for the next while", "selftext": "So here it is boys, the most DD-ish type of thread you'll see around these parts.\n\nFirst, look at this chart for Ally by YCharts:  [https://imgur.com/a/yrtqODy](https://imgur.com/a/yrtqODy) \n\nAs you can see, these guys blow it out of the water every quarter. Solid EPS, good fundamentals, and an opportunity for huge growth now.\n\nAs you can see, their stock price has fluctuated between $25.80 to $35.42 over the past 52 weeks. Right now the stock price currently falls into the mid range, and it dropped from $32.04 to $28.30 based on news that they acquired Cardworks.\n\nNow let's look at Cardworks for a quick second - $ALLY spent $2.65 BILLION dollars to acquire them. What did they get with this acquisition you ask? Well, for starters, Cardworks has $4.7 BILLION worth of ASSETS and $2.9 BILLION in deposits... seems like a no-brainer for a takeover if your company is wanting to expand and grow, no? This acquisition will provide them the instant capability to grow and expand.\n\nNow - why did the stock price drop you ask?\n\nBecause they SPENT $2.65 BILLION DOLLARS and boomer investors do not like that. Keep the money in the company, keep the value high, don't let anyone put their hands into the cookie jar! This sudden drop is usually found after an acquisition, and time after time you see the stock correct back up to the levels it was previously at and after, EVEN HIGHER. $ALLY just made a huge move for growth and is a financially successful company.\n\nTo put it into comparison, $SPCE has a market cap of $7.3 billion and is a purely speculative company. $ALLY has a market cap of $11.2 billion and has REVENUE and PROFITS to back it up. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for a rocket ship to the moon, but at certain times you have to look at the FUNDAMENTALS to understand what's going on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - $ALLY prints money, enjoy the free tendies as it shoots back up to the $31 - $33 range, and I'll see all you basement dwellers in Valhalla!!  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80", "created_utc": 1582294840, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7bqc6/why_you_should_be_buying_ally_for_the_next_while/", "is_self": true}
