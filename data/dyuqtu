{"id": "dyuqtu", "title": "$ROST earnings on Thursday", "selftext": "Yup.  Fuckin ROSS.  That shitty discount store whose sign looks like a blue dumpster.  Their earnings are coming up and I'm predicting +20%.  Discount Becky loves a good deal and she's broke as shit from buying airpods and dropping them while jogging.  That's why TGT and BURL have already boomed +20% on earnings.  Ask any Becky or Karen.  They love the treasure hunt.  ROST is always busy and the stock has been based for the last month.  I've got some options and shares.  Nothing YOLO-level ($1800 total).  But thought I'd share it since everyone is hopped up on AMD nose candy right now.  \n\n\nYou can thank me later", "created_utc": 1574214524, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dyuqtu/rost_earnings_on_thursday/", "is_self": true}
