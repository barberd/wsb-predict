Nothing. I email again. And again, and about 5 more times, call  and get nothing, dial some corporate number to talk to any fucking monkey that\u2019ll answer to click assign on my fucking put but nothing. \n\nThis morning at 12:01am, I get an email Robinhood that I\u2019ve been assigned. How did this mother fucker exercise? \u201cWhatever, now they\u2019ll have to exercise mine\u201d I naively tell myself.\n\nI email pre-market, and at opening. Nothing. I go to sell, won\u2019t let me sell either, account restrictions. THE FUCK!? So not only are they not exercising, I can\u2019t fucking sell either. My account is literally paralyzed. Tesla bottoms at $222, my put is +$800 in the money and I cannot do a god damn thing.\n\nTesla then shoots up to 230, they exercise my the spread put finally, after my put I can\u2019t touch goes from $15 to $7.30 or some shit.\n\nIt didn\u2019t end there though. Because of my restricted account, they DIDNT automatically sell my ITM put as they should\u2019ve, they exercised it at 4:30pm. This retarded fuck-uppery is actually going to work in my favor (I presume naively) because the price they bought my shares at for me has a greater gain than what the value of my contract was actually worth by $100.\n\nCome Monday I\u2019m doubling down on Tesla put credit spreads.", "created_utc": 1564190256, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cibcib/robinhood_spread_fun/", "is_self": true}
