{"id": "fc6yyx", "title": "China Lockdown Will Define Direction of Markets", "selftext": "For the past \\~40 days, Hubei province has been in a mandatory lockdown.  Hubei province has a population of 58.5 Million people.  They have a GDP of $595 Billion USD, which is a per capita rate of $10,099 USD.  Following the Hubei lockdown, the government expanded the lockdown to impact \\~500 million people.  Most of them need government permission just to leave their house.\n\nThis was done to curb the spread of coronavirus, and has almost certainly been effective.  If you look at the rate of spread in Hubei versus the rest of China, you can see how the lockdown was able to prevent exponential spread.  \n\nHowever, now the country (outside of Hubei) is looking to gradually reduce the lockdown and restart regular activity.  This is going to define the future of the country.  If the lockdown is removed, and the virus starts spreading again, then it will be incredibly demoralizing.  These people have suffered mentally, make no mistake.  Being under house arrest takes a toll on your health.\n\nSo if the population realizes that the lockdown was only effective in delaying the spread, and that once activities resumed, the spread continued its exponential trajectory, then expect things to get ugly.  It will signal that lockdowns can delay, but not prevent, the illness from spreading.  Even worse, it could be that once the lockdowns are removed, spreading picks right back up with an exponential trajectory.\n\nThe rest of the world will grapple with the reality that even China's historic lockdown of hundreds of millions of people only delayed the inevitable spread of the virus.  It will force the question of whether to extend lockdowns or just let the virus run rampant through the population.  \n\nThen the other scenario is that the lockdown succeeded.  Cases outside of Hubei never go exponential, and the disease is properly contained.  This would be very encouraging for the world as a whole, and we could expect to see many other areas attempt to integrate China's strategy.", "created_utc": 1583125109, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fc6yyx/china_lockdown_will_define_direction_of_markets/", "is_self": true}
