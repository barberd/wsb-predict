{"id": "d2tdcm", "title": "Undervalued Utah Chemical Corporation", "selftext": "Hello retards, I'm back with another DD.  This one's pretty short; I entered into a big long position on Huntsman Corp (HUN) that I think should be between twice and three times as expensive as it is now.  \n\nBefore I go into my DD, I want to talk about the MNK analysis I did a bit less than a month ago.  As you probably know, MNK went caput pretty promptly after I bought stock.  I didn't spend enough time making sure I understood the nature of their opioid law suits, and I probably should have talked to someone with a JD about whether MNK was allowed to complete the spin-off of a new Mallinkrodt from Sonorant Therapeutics that I found so attractive.  If anyone lost money off my DD, I'm sorry.  Okay, here we go with HUN.\n\nFamily-run chemical company HUN was about 2 bucks a share after the financial crisis because they were going to get bought until their buyers pulled out because the whole stock market died.  Since then, the tightly-managed chemical firm has consistently proved to investors that they're still worth their salt.  The stock has rebounded to around 22 bucks since then, which is pretty phenomenal, but they're not done.  \n\nOne event stands out to me as a reason to invest ASAP.  Last month, HUN sold its chemical intermediates and surfactants units to Thai firm Indorama Ventures.  These units are considered by analysts to be the flabbiest of HUN's assets, so it makes sense to sell them to someone who can give them the focus they need.  The units comprised about 20% of HUN's business at the time, and they sold for $2 billion.  \n\nHUN stock, in the mid-low 20s right now, is super cheap, then.  It's got a market cap of five and a quarter billion when it should objectively be at least 8 and probably more.  Remember that the chemical intermediates and surfactants were their least profitable assets, so I'd say HUN's market cap should really be around 11 or 12 billion.  \n\nI'm hoping it'll work its way up to 45-60 some time in the next couple years, which seems like a fair price.  Let me know what you guys think.", "created_utc": 1568221455, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d2tdcm/undervalued_utah_chemical_corporation/", "is_self": true}
