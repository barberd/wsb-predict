{"id": "eu20rd", "title": "First it's marijuana, next it's DMT [serious]", "selftext": "I'm 100% serious, despite the flair. DMT and 2 other similar specific drugs too. Please treat me with respect like you would Michael Burry himself. This is 2024, maybe 2028 shit. tl;dr at bottom\n\nI introduce you to [reed canarygrass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalaris_arundinacea), which grows all over the northern continental US, especially in shit conditions, and contains DMT, 5-MeO DMT, and bufotenin. Here is a map of where reed canarygrass grows naturally, from the [USDA](https://plants.usda.gov/core/profile?symbol=PHAR3).\n\nDMT is endorsed by science and by Joe Rogan himself. It makes you see colors, geometry, fractals and shit while in a fully awake, dream-like state. Your entire vision can be clouded by it. It also can seem like you die, or a literal eternity passes, or other fun stuff.\n\nWhat's 5-MeO-DMT? You know it as toad stuff. It's like DMT, but something like 30x stronger. Here's a link from some faggot ass reputable university about [5-MeO-MDT helping with depression and anxiety](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/newsroom/news-releases/fast-acting-psychedelic-associated-with-improvements-in-depressionanxiety).\n\nBufotenin is in the infamous 5-MeO-DMT toad venom, but also in other toads. It's the biological building block of 5-MeO-DMT.\n\nAnyway, reed canarygrass is totally legal. End sentence. It can grow 6+ feet high, and while the psychadelic alkaloid concentration isn't high, it's good enough to run an extraction.\n\n&gt; Mr. u/LongJNUG, what can these psychedelics, potent beyond comprehension of the general populace, do for me?\n\nJust dig around a little bit and you'll find lots of trustworthy sources of info on benefits and potential benefits of DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, and bufotenin, among other similar drugs (a category which includes shrooms). As demonstrated once previously above.\n\nCBD is still Schedule I, but I can buy all kinds of CBD products at a store with CBD in the title? Why not reed canarygrass extracc?\n\nI am still 100% serious please bear with me and remember to acknowledge me as Michael Burry in the flesh: criminal drug syndicates please stop the needless toad deaths and harvest reed canarygrass. **Please stop the needless toad deaths**. Just buy this shit from northern continental US farmers. Maybe you can even do it legally.\n\ntl;dr DMT, 5MeO DMT, and bufotenin (similar to both) gon' be legal because of some dumb grass (pun intended)", "created_utc": 1580012404, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eu20rd/first_its_marijuana_next_its_dmt_serious/", "is_self": true}
