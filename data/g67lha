{"id": "g67lha", "title": "Quick USO Update - Quantifying why it's down today", "selftext": "Hi Ya'll - gonna keep this as quick as possible. USO halted trading briefly today, and some new numbers were published showing what they planned on/ are now holding, and this may clarify for some of you why they are down today:\n\nPrevious Price at Close | Previous NAV | Premium\n:--:|:--:|:--:\n$2.81 | $2.06 | 36%\n\nUh oh... remember, USO ran out of shares it could issue, and with the retail inflows, there was a pressure on the share price to rise and dislocate from the underlying assets -> hence, 36% premium at yesterday's price at close.\n\nWhat happened today (Will be confirmed after close):\n\n\nContracts (Month) | % Holding, Open | % Holding, 2:35PM | Weighted Average, Open | Weighted Average, Close\n:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:\nJune| 20% | 20% | 2.052 | 2.806\nJuly| 80% | 50% | 13.944 | 10.41\nAugust | 0 % | 20% | 0 | 10.737\nSept | 0 % | 5% |0 | 1.2905\n\nNow, if you remember back to highschool, you should be able to do some weighted average calculations to confirm: Since USO rolled forward their contracts, what is the penatly (cost in numebr of contracts held) that they incurred?\nSum weighted previous close: 15.996\nSum weighted 2:35PM : 19.279\n\nRelative number of contracts held: 17% fewer contracts (give or take a few %). This is a reduction in barrels of oil per share of exposure (lower reactivity to future price swings). The second issue, is a reduction in the sensitivity to the spot price, as they are now concentrated so far in the future (lower reactivity to spot price changes). So what do we have? We now have a fund that still has massive structural issues, but probably won't blow up by Friday (unless bigly negative oil). We also ***cannot expect they will ever achieve their highs again due to continued contango, and, even if backwardation were to start tomorrow, they are much worse positioned to benefit from higher oil prices.*** You are looking at a new fund: if you want to invest in it, have an idea of how changes in oil price might impact the fund's performance.... yikes...\n \nUsing the prices of WTI oil futures at 2:35, I find that the new mix of futures $USO holds have increased 26%. Multiply this increase in value by the NAV at close, and we find $2.58 (2:25PM). Right now, USO is at $2.50, which means the market has reduced the arbitrage opportunity (3.2% premium, down from 36% the day before).\n\nI will check these numbers tonight after market's close, and once the NAV is published. This fund is still int trouble, but taking steps so as not to immediately collapse.\n\nTLDR: \n\nPrevious NAV | Asset % Change| New est. NAV | Current Price\n:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:\n$2.06 | 21% | $2.50 | $2.58", "created_utc": 1587583629.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g67lha/quick_uso_update_quantifying_why_its_down_today/", "is_self": true}
