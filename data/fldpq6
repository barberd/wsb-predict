Jesus christ I don't know what the actual mathematical definition of a bounce is].\n\n\nI'm expecting SPY to be back up around 255-260 next week.\n\n\nMy buddy who trades and codes for Citadel focuses on sentiment analysis says that consumers and the market appear to have \"accepted\" the current situation and that even a 5-10x increase in reported cases is priced in. The market fucking loves this $3k cash payment plan and the military's involvement. Remember, most people's monthly payments have been frozen (rent, student loan interest, CC bills) so most of that $3k is going right back into the market to get multiplied like the beer virus.\n\n\nBoys and girls it's important to remember that as of yesterday we are down 30% from peak. No bear market in history has dropped more than that before a flat period or bounce. I guessing we will drop another 10-15% over the coming 6 months, but it will be much more gradual.\n\n\nI have a shitton of April 17 SPY 200 Puts, and I'm still green but down about 50% from yesterday.\n\n\nGodspeed and consider rolling your short term puts into something closer to the fall.", "created_utc": 1584638134.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fldpq6/bounce/", "is_self": true}
