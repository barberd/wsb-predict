I was shocked like many tonight when the sub went private, and I am glad we are all back now.\n\nDespite the fact that people self-ascribe as retards here, there is honestly great DD when you look through the noise. When there is breaking news, this is where I check first. When a stock takes off, this is where you read it first. And when the shit hits the fan, this is the only place with tendies.\n\nI probably would not have bought one put if I never read wsb before this mess, and now I\u2019m on my fourth roll down and out, still winning. No, it\u2019s not a yolo (it\u2019s my IRA, so fuck off), but I have made some money in a brutal sell off that left 99% of retail investors crippled.\n\nThanks for everything, everybody!\n\nSpy 4/17 245p\nSpy 3/20 230-250p spread", "created_utc": 1584326500.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjdo1m/thank_you_wsb/", "is_self": true}
