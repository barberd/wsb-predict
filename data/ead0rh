AWS is already huge. MSFT kinda killing it lately but market cap is also big. GOOG,  IDK what is growth like there? I imagine GOOG interface is read a 10 page tutorial and use our CLI. IBM has surprisingly good tech, but I question their ability to market it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo where we at? Cloud is obviously the future, but who is undervalued?", "created_utc": 1576285739, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ead0rh/cloud_providers_who_will_win/", "is_self": true}
