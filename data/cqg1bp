{"id": "cqg1bp", "title": "To Recession or not to recession? That is the question...", "selftext": "Look at all the fancy numbers!  Keep in mind, today was largely algo driven.  Literally scalped /ES five or six times today just by watching the spread between the 2/10 year widen, waited for it to begin narrowing, algos kick in and start selling, short /ES, close position when spread begins to widen.  \n\nJust keep in mind, algos drive moves like this.  Algos triggered sell when the spread narrowed and triggered buy when it widened.  They do the same thing for Trump's tweets.  Positive tariff news triggers BUY ALL THE THINGS (look at yesterday's markets).\n\nSo remember, w/ the VIX above 20 again, all that means is that markets are volatile.  Volatility doesn't just swing down but swings up as well.  **It also means options premium is VERY EXPENSIVE relative to two weeks ago.**  \n\n**In this vol environment, this is a great opportunity to sell premium and wait for vol contraction.  One might consider selling 16 delta SPY or /ES 45DTE and wait for vol to get sucked out.**  \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/h61ekrn8chg31.png", "created_utc": 1565817344, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cqg1bp/to_recession_or_not_to_recession_that_is_the/", "is_self": true}
