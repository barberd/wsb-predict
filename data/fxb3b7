And with the complication rate, more people would have gone to the hospital than did, so it makes the case that we got lucky with our experts and Trump saying to shut down before the virus was able to saturate the country even more.\n\nSecond, \"asymptomatic\" in this context is only for a certain time until symptoms develop... asymptomatic means they are contagious even with no symptoms appearing, and symptoms do appear for the asymptomatic cases; the \"asymptomatic\" connotation has come to mean a coronavirus infection that never presents symptoms during the entire duration of the infection, right?  If that is all correct, then many people have no idea what they're talking about and it's absolutely not priced in to the market whatsoever.  \n\nThere is a lot of cognitive-bias occurring in the culture, particularly normalcy bias, cognitive-dissonance, as well as a very understandable grief cycle ([https://psychcentral.com/lib/the-5-stages-of-loss-and-grief/](https://psychcentral.com/lib/the-5-stages-of-loss-and-grief/)).\n\nMaybe that's good people are in denial so toilet paper goes back on the shelves since people will stop hoarding it, but I think the market will drop another 30% and maybe more after the market goes high enough for big fish to take their new short positions.  We have the greatest economy the world has ever seen... without coronavirus.  \n\nLong story short: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* SPY $70 JULY PUTS", "created_utc": 1586368015.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxb3b7/new_r0_reanalysis_from_cdc_puts_covid19_at_a_57/", "is_self": true}
