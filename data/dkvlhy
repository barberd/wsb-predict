This company is finding one. Their trials are stellar. It\u2019s doing so good they are being put through by January 20 for immediate approval by FDA. They are already aggressively premarketing. Also the stock are shit for 7% after a huge jump and is back at their way old IPO price. Their CEO has millions of shares and keeps buying. These guys have money and they know MDs in right places. This new med is going to be pushed through likely before 1/20. I\u2019m guessing 80/share and looking to sell to bigger company. Their option volume is piss. I know this is WSB. \n\nI\u2019m 10k in (100k in on DIS for comparison) but am waiting for a bad day to double that position and hold until after the fda prints cash for me.
