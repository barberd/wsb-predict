TURN is next.", "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/u4ejmifyoj151.png?width=877&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d84b3c06a96037ed44d4602b3f515f0bc1bfe7a\n\n**An Introduction To TURN** \n \nTURN, or [180 Degree Capital Corp](http://www.180degreecapital.com/#TURN), is an activist firm that works to invest in \"substantially undervalued small, publicly traded companies that have potential for significant turnarounds\" with the goal of creating a \"a reversal in direction for the share prices... I.E., a 180-Degree Turn\". These guys are not as big as the Fed, but they have been doing the same thing for years. This is literally V-shaped recovery if it were a stock.\n\n**What they own**  \n\nSo what do they own? A pretty big portfolio. I know I know, the word \"diversify\" or even \"diverse\" scares me too, but hey, gotta grow up some day. They have a bunch of shit, but notable positions in:\n\nAdesto: Low power memory solutions. These words probably don't make much sense to you but essentially it allows computing with low power. Allowing you to make \"smart\" anything without a huge battery attached to it. Big upcoming tech.\n\nSynacor: Multiplatform developer of internet and video communications shit. What do people need while WuFlu rampages the globe? Internet and video communications services. And with the success of Zoom, there's gonna be a shit ton of start ups that try to get in on the boom, most likely turning to these guys to get them going.\n\nTheStreet: You know that weird website slipping into your google results for whatever weird stocks you're searching? Yeah, that's this thing. Wall street news that actually pops up on a google search. With the massive surge in retail investors, all financial news outlets are gonna be seeing big money. So what if financial news is bullshit? Somebody clicked on it, this thing makes money.\n\nThey also have a sizable stake in D-Wave, which is the leading quantum computing firm in the world. They've already churned out a few machines and are researching the topic more.\n\nWith all this, you'd expect the stock to be at ATH like the rest of this backwards market. Instead, it's at $1.63 at the time of writing this. And that's after going up 3% today. The chart's pretty busted after the CoronaCrash so it's kinda hard to do TA, if someone is better at that than I am please feel free to put your thoughts in the comments.\n\n**Recent News**  \n\nOn May 5th, 2020, TURN sold its life sciences portfolio for $4.4 million. It was valued at $2.2 million on March 31st. Basically, these guys sold the pharma pump for 100% profit and got it bought out by an undisclosed party. Upon the news breaking, the CEO stated \"As long as the transaction closes as expected, we currently expect a 4x to 5x increase to the value of this company in Q2 2020.\" [You can read more here](https://ir.180degreecapital.com/press-releases/detail/331/180-degree-capital-corp-life-science-portfolio-company).\n\nThe C-Suite has purchased a shit ton of new shares as well. [VP Robert E. Bigelow purchased 51,250 shares](https://theenterpriseleader.com/2020/05/13/robert-e-bigelow-iii-purchases-51250-shares-of-180-degree-capital-corp-nasdaqturn-stock.html) at $1.63 on May 7th, [CEO Kevin Rendino bought 25,000 shares](https://theenterpriseleader.com/2020/05/21/180-degree-capital-corp-nasdaqturn-ceo-kevin-rendino-buys-25000-shares.html) at $1.59 on May 12th. So people are buying into this move.\n\n**What to buy**\n\nThe options on this puppy are pretty bad, not gonna lie. Although most are pretty cheap, they just aren't available at nice values and have pretty low liquidity. I would recommend shares, although I'm an autist so I bought $2.5 December calls. I think there's a good chance the company grows above that by then, especially if we get stuck in this backward ass market forever.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jvooxee5qj151.png?width=731&format=png&auto=webp&s=30abc501f179344c18ce15d7b2ce0e37710c73de\n\nTLDR; TURN has me TURNT", "created_utc": 1590689246.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gsbbt3/like_vtiq_turn_is_next/", "is_self": true}
