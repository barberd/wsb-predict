{"id": "ebg3mf", "title": "NFLX is coiling up for a rally", "selftext": "I've got a long position in NFLX.  I don't care about fundamentals here, so don't bother talking about that.  I am referring to the technical picture.  After the ass kicking it took off the top, it has settled in and is choppy.  The relative valuation ratios are looking good.  That's not to say that a long position is a slam dunk.  I wouldn't be short though.  Be wary if you are bearish this stock.  On the other hand, I am looking at a couple of stocks that are developing shorts.  I haven't established positions yet, so I am not going to disclose them, but the relative valuation ratios for those stocks are declining while NFLX is rising from a decent trough.\n\nI have been bullish oil for several weeks.  Interest rates are going to rise, so treasuries and gold are dead money to bearish.  I've dumped all my HK stocks.  Garbage stuff that has too much political overhang even though relative valuation are really low.\n\nTo sum it up, NFLX and oil are what I am looking at now.  There are a ton of other stocks that are bullish.  You could almost just throw a dart on the board.  This is just what I am looking at now.", "created_utc": 1576508005, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ebg3mf/nflx_is_coiling_up_for_a_rally/", "is_self": true}
