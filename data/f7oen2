{"id": "f7oen2", "title": "$TSLA - nice relative strength on a weak market", "selftext": "Hey guys I just wanted to post my observation. \n\n$TSLA is a heavily shorted stock because it ran for so much. But let's look at the price action, when market was weak today, TSLA remained strong and finished above the vwap.\n\nIf market bounces on monday and TSLA can base and hold 905 area I like it for LONG idea into 913.06 (today's high breakout)\n\nDo not overestimate how much this baby can ran. It can easily squeeze $40-50 range\n\nLooking for interesting opinions.", "created_utc": 1582350420, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7oen2/tsla_nice_relative_strength_on_a_weak_market/", "is_self": true}
