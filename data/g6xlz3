Why the fuck aren't you buying gold mining stocks?\n\nThe Fed printed more money in the first 5 weeks of this crisis than the entire 6 years of the 2008 crisis.  Gold is near it's all time highs and Bank of Fucking America said it's going to hit $3K in 18 months.  Gold mining stocks are at half of their all time highs.  Where do you think they are going to go?\n\nIf the market goes up, the Fed already printed the money, the price rise is baked in.\n\nIf the market goes down (which it should, eventually) the Fed will just print moar money, which means gold will eventually go higher.  \n\nIt costs gold miners about $1k to get an oz of gold out of the ground.  They were selling it at $1300 last year for a profit of $300.  They are selling it for $1700 now.  Their profit went up 2.33x in a year.  It will probably also double again in a year.  What happens to the stock price when the profits double?  It goes down?\n\nThese guys are going to be one of the only sectors posting good earnings for this year and probably next year.  It's the only sure way to fuck over the Fed.  \n\nStop being an idiot.  Buy leap calls on gold miner stocks.  Jan 2022 calls on GOLD, AUY, NEM, AEM, KL.\n\nWhen the Fed prints money these stocks go up.  The Fed is being much more proactive in the QE this time.  That's what QE infinity means.  Our whole pension system depends on these over priced and inflated piece of shit assets.  The Fed cannot let them fail.   They will destroy the dollar before letting a market crash happen.  \n\nI bought a bunch of leap calls on the 8th of March, right before the market shartening.  I initially lost some money.  I held.  Now I'm up 160%", "created_utc": 1587685129.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6xlz3/gold_mining_stocks_are_the_chinese_fingertrap/", "is_self": true}
