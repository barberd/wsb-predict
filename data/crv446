Let me tell you a little story.\n\nMy father used to be president of CVI before they were acquired by Time Warner. He worked directly for Allen Gerry. His bonuses included tons of stock options over the years. Time Warner bought out CVI in 1996 and he was given the position of President for the tri-state area. His CVI stocks were converted to T... Here's where the fuck up begins.\n\nWhen I was young, I was very into computer hardware / software and grew up with the beginning of the internet. We even had the first personal cable modem road runner line run directly to our house about a year before it was made publicly available. I was a smart kid and convinced my parents to switch us from AOL to EarthLink as it was a much better service provider at the time. Over the first few years everything was great until in 1999 my dad came home one day and asked me how I felt about AOL. I showed him my pile of AOL cd's I'd get in the mail every couple of weeks which I was saving to use as a pseudo wallpaper. I tried to explain to him that AOL was dead at the time and all my friends have already switched away from AOL. Even around school we would laugh at people who still had AOL email accounts.\n\nSo obviously anyone over the age of 30 knows how this shit whent down. My father took my advice and tried to pitch the board to reconsider the acquisition  but obviously failed. So he decided to ride it out with his stocks. 2000 came around and the bubble burst into a huge pile of shit. My father lost over 8 Million in assets the same year my Mother passed away from cancer and was forced to retire early for a 5 year severance. \n\nWhen we were young he had big plans to retire by 50 but was forced into retirement and lost about 3/4 of his net worth and my mother in the process. \n\nLuckily he is pretty smart with his money and has been able to live in a high end condo on a golf resort for his retirement. However last week he has started asking us kids for money. We have no problem giving it to him it's just really sad to see him on such a limited budget. \n\nWhen I told him I have been day trading options he was furious at me. He has sworn off the stock market and could not believe I would risk my money in such a way. \n\nIt's sad to know that someone who came from nothing built an empire and the lost it all due to a crash. \n\nKeep that in mind when Trump leaves office and we get slammed by the communists... \n\nTl;dr: Dad was big time money maker. AOL TW crash lost everything plus his wife. \n\nKeep eating those sweet tendies while we can boys!
