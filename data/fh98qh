So now that I am at my last 5k, I need advice. I have made some good trades but that was when the bull was oozing testosterone from the fucking nose. Things have changed. This 5k is what remains from a 15k cash advance on a credit card I got 2 weeks ago which was the full limit of the card.\n\nEdit*: I work in Tech as an independent contractor, so I make good bank. Good for the 15k debt. But still it sucks if I lose all the 15k and don't gain jack shit from it.", "created_utc": 1583980208.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fh98qh/5k_to_salvage/", "is_self": true}
