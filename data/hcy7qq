{"id": "hcy7qq", "title": "Square Inc is Ripe for a Drop", "selftext": "Ok, lets get at this.  \n\nNot going to bury the lead here - SQ is about to drop and drop hard. Lets take a look at the overall picture. SQ in May missed EPS substantially when they reported earnings. Not by a percent or two, but posted a negative $.02 vs the positive $.13 that everyone expected. All of the little mom and pop shops that have been using Square as a payment processor were shut down by COVID and the gross payment volume fell off a cliff. Despite the earnings beat, and the fact that their revenue source was quite literally dying in front of their eyes, SQ's price action never really dropped. It just kept climbing from $62 in early May when they announced earnings, up to the $102 we saw on Friday, buoyed up by the same rising tide that lifted the rest of the markets in the post-March bounce.  This brings us to today, or really yesterday- Friday the 19th.  \n\n  \n\nWe find ourselves on the edge of another possible resurgence in COVID. I know, I know, \"hurr durr it's nothing, it's priced in, JPow won't let it happen, election year, brrrrrrrrrrr\" - I'm hearing what you're saying but I just don't see it. I'm not a perma-bear or anything, I just think that people are going to get scared in the short term and SQ's technicals put it in a very precarious position. Think about it. Their main source of revenue got shut down for almost 3 months. Even as things open up it's going to be slow, so there is zero reason they should have hit an ATH on Friday but they did. On top of that, they're currently sitting in overbought territory on the RSI- - a place they've been at or near since May. They also have been painting lower highs on the RSI while maintaining higher highs on price- a bearish indicator. Volume has been declining and they just posted a beautiful textbook shooting star reversal pattern on the daily charts after briefly touching ATH and then moving downward.  \n\n  \n\nI'm not psychic. I'm not even really a trader. I may be retarded. But I think that there is enough of case to be made to pick up some puts - I know I did. 7/17 $90p - bought at the top when they hit 102.  I'm sure that someone in here is going to tell me how wrong I am but we can wait a month and see because I'm riding this sled downhill to tendie town.", "created_utc": 1592703345.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hcy7qq/square_inc_is_ripe_for_a_drop/", "is_self": true}
