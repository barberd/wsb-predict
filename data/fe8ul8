Fuckin ZM... killed earnings, and still had everyone shittin their pants when their stock went down. It didn't make any bit of sense. But then 10am swing around, and 15 bucks up. Booyah. We like that. Costco I fuckin guarantee is gonna pull a ZM. Hey, and you know who else pulled a ZM? Motha fuckin AMD. Like seriously, down all the way to 47.8??? With all that beautiful good news surrounding it. It just didn't make any sense. Oh, but then afterhours came around, and the sonovabitch gained 3 bucks. Listen, Costco is doing the same motha fuckin thing. I'm down to argue.", "created_utc": 1583472616, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fe8ul8/costco_behaving_exactly_like_zm/", "is_self": true}
