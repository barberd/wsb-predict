{"id": "e9dreg", "title": "LULU and \"priced in\" earnings beats", "selftext": "Hey y'all, I got a question that's been boggling my mind for a bit now.  Are earnings based on guidance set in the previous quarter? For example,  Company A sees Q2 guidance of 1B revenue and 1.5 EPS. Does that mean  Company A's estimates for Q2 are 1B revenue and 1.5 EPS? If the answer is no because estimates may change depending upon news that may impact  Company A's revenue and profit, then how does a company's earnings  become \"priced in\". In essence, LULU's earnings beat on revenue and EPS  estimates and their guidance was in-line; however, it's down 5% AH.  While I understand it's up about 90% YoY, shouldn't this be reflected in  their estimates? thanks guys", "created_utc": 1576100761, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e9dreg/lulu_and_priced_in_earnings_beats/", "is_self": true}
