{"id": "gzwura", "title": "Buyer Beware: The saga of my DGLY options \u201cmarket\u201d order.", "selftext": "Posting for a friend who is too new to post himself (good rule, btw). I am \u201cmy boy\u201d from the set-up. His words below. \n\n\u201cGreetings to my fellow autists. Sharing this story to hopefully save at least one other soul from going through the last 5 hours of hell I just endured. \n\nThe set-up: me and my boy were looking to make a play on DGLY, thanks to some research on his part and some good DD from some of y\u2019all here on WSB. Well, when the market opened today we went to place our calls. I put in a 10 limit orders at the current ask price (about $1.60 at the time), but no takers. I put in a limit order at $.10 above ask, still nothing. Finally I say fuck it and throw in a market order figuring I\u2019ll end up paying $2.00 or so. Order goes through, all is well. Or is it... I look at the transaction and I got the contracts FOR $21.20 EACH. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK?! \n\nI immediately shit myself and stare at my computer screen for about 2 minutes in shock. My account immediately reflects the loss and I\u2019m now down about $20,000. As reality slowly starts to set in and I wipe the tears away, I decide to call my broker. Of course I\u2019m on hold for about 15 minutes waiting for them to pick up but finally I get through. I regale Cliff with my dreadful tale and he gets to work talking with his office to see what he can do. After about 20 more minutes I hear back, apparently during the time I was trying to buy my calls, there was a 5 minute window that no trades were going through. I put in my market order and some how or another someone nabbed it up for the tasty $20000 tendies. He says that his guys in the back office are going to call down to the trading floor, but not to hold my breath because he\u2019s never seen a trade get reversed in his life. He says that this process may take a few hours but that he will get back to me ASAP, then politely hangs up. \n\nAs I put my phone down, I start to think about all the amazing trades I could have made with this $20000, and slowly come to terms with the fact that 1) I\u2019m never seeing this money again, 2) my wife is going to absolutely murder me, and 3) I am probably not going to work today as I am far to depressed to do anything other than play my PS4 and try to pretend I\u2019m not living in this horrific nightmare. \n\nAfter a few hours of gaming, I\u2019m just as sad as before and I decide I need to eat something even though I\u2019m very nauseated and not at all hungry. At this point it\u2019s past noon my time and this ordeal has been going on for almost 5 hours. Suddenly, my phone starts exploding and it\u2019s my broker app. I see random trades start going on my account for DGLY calls, 1-2 at a time. First they are buys for $21.20, then buys for $3.10. I\u2019m confused but also excited as any action is good action at this point. About 10 minutes later, I check my account balance and it\u2019s back to normal. My broker calls and tells me that, somehow, the market makers saved my ass and gave me the trades for $3.10 each instead of $21.20. He also informs me that in the 5 years he\u2019s worked there he and his coworkers have never seen a trade reversed like this, and that it\u2019s an actual miracle. I\u2019m literally speechless. After Cliff says \u201cHello?\u201d A couple times and I come back to my senses I thank him for his hard work and offer to name my first born after him, to which he laughs and politely says he was just doing his job. We part ways, and I stand in my kitchen staring out the window, wondering if this all really happened, or if it was just a terrible dream. (Then of course I look at my account again and see the calls, which are of course still red. But hey, I just got $17000 back so I\u2019m not complaining). \n\nI fully expect to get absolutely obliterated by some of you all for not knowing this could happen, but I genuinely didn\u2019t realize how bad you could get fucked by a market order. As I said in the beginning, if this saves even one person from what I just went through then all the downvotes will be worth it. \n\nTL;DR: I used a market order on a stonk that was mooning and bought it for 15x the ask price. By some JPOW money printing miracle my broker convinced the market makers to change the trade and I got 90% of my money back. \n\nTakeaways for everyone: \n\n1) If I were using Robin Hood I would most certainly be out all that money. Use a real broker and pay the commission fees for your trades, you never know when it might save you. \n\n2) Always do limit orders. I\u2019m sure someone out there will be happy to tell me why a market order could be better in some situations, but you can go fuck yourself cuz I\u2019ll never do it again. \n\n3) Buy DGLY calls and help me get the rest of my money back. \n\nI hope you all enjoyed my saga, I look forward to reading the comments.
