Built my net worth and career by finding substantially mispriced asymmetric investments/trades. \n\nThe uranium mining trade is the most asymmetric investment I've come across in my career. The best way to play it is through $CCJ 1/22 $15 Calls. 10-15x+ upside.\n\nUranium (U308) is the top performing commodity of 2020. +33% YTD. ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-commodity-performer-uranium-gains-174753885.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-commodity-performer-uranium-gains-174753885.html)) \n\nThe party is just getting started. \n\n**The industry has been in the shit house since the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan. Prices went from $70+/lb in 2011 to \\~$33/lb today. They were around $120-130/lb in 2007.** \n\nUranium is used for nuclear power generation. 20% of US power and 10% of global power comes from nuclear. Demand for nuclear power is growing \\~2%/yr, mostly driven by China. China thinks with 10+ year time horizon. Demand for nuclear power not impacted by COVID-19 ([https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-energy-nuclear/china-says-virus-outbreak-will-not-impact-nuclear-power-plant-construction-idUSKCN21X0B4](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-energy-nuclear/china-says-virus-outbreak-will-not-impact-nuclear-power-plant-construction-idUSKCN21X0B4)).\n\nThis is a supply story. Mining at today\u2019s prices is uneconomical. **From 2017-2018, mine closures due to unprofitable production led to 25% of global uranium supply being shut down, including the world's largest uranium mine (McArthur River).** Imagine what would happen to the price of oil if 25% of global oil supply was taken offline.\n\nSo why didn't the supply cuts lead to a higher uranium prices? \n\nThe market was still oversupplied after Fukushima. Japan was 12% of global uranium demand and shut down all their reactors post-2011. There was still an excess of supply in the spot market. \n\nFor nuclear power plants, running out of fuel is not an option. And Utilities can\u2019t just put uranium from a mine into their reactors \u2013 there are a lot of steps in between. The nuclear fuel cycle takes 18 -24 months. Nuclear power utilities typically enter into long-term 8-10 year contracts to ensure security of supply. \n\nMany nuclear power utilities locked into long-term contracts for uranium at the peak of the prior bull market in 2011. Those contracts are now entering a roll-off phase. **40% of utility demand is uncovered in 2020 and over 80% is uncovered by 2025** **(source: UxC).**\n\nSo why is the uranium price +33% YTD? \n\nDue to COVID-19, Kazatomprom, the largest uranium producer, announced in April it was reducing activities at its uranium mines for three months. Meanwhile, Cameco ($CCJ), the #2 largest uranium miner in the world, halted production at their Cigar Lake mine in Canada, the world\u2019s largest producing mine, then extended the suspension for an \u201cindeterminate\u201d period on April 13. **All told, the shutdowns wiped out about 35% of annual mined global uranium output.** \n\nThe excess post-Fukishima material has finally worked its way out of the market and utilities are waking up to how tight the market really is (hence +30% rally in March). **The cash costs to produce uranium are about $25-$30 per pound and the all-in sustaining cost when you add exploratory capex, royalties etc., is near $50-$60 per pound.** \n\nThe next uranium contracting cycle is upon us, and prices will need to rise materially to incentivize new production. The best way to play this is through $CCJ 1/22 $15 Calls. CCJ is easily a $30+ stock at $50-$60/lb uranium (I have a model, not just sticking my dick in the air). Calls have 10-15x+ upside.\n\nWhy the long dated calls? \n\nOption math works a lot better over short intervals. Once you extend the time horizon, all sorts of exogenous variables can throw a wrench into option-pricing models. \n\nRemember, a key assumption of black-scholes is that daily stock price changes are independent of the prior days\u2014i.e. trends are not predictable and daily changes in stock prices reflect no memory of prior days; there is no price reflexivity. \n\nThe longer the time period, the greater the potential for a trend, and hence the greater the chance that a longer-term price move will exceed the standard deviation implied probability, which increases only by the square root of time.\n\nA lot more I could add about the industry/$CCJ but that's enough for now.
