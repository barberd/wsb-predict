{"id": "h10td2", "title": "[$RACE][06/11/20] \"Ferrari is becoming the new Porsche.\"", "selftext": "In 2019 Ferrari delivered 10,131 cars; more than ever before. Since Ferrari went public in 2015, the stock has been on a climb, rising 350% in the five years since IPO. The luxury market has historically been defensive towards market downturns, as was shown during the 2008 financial crisis, where Ferrari only lost about 7% of sales from 20008-2009. Relative to some other companies, RACE dipped only moderately as Italy bore the brunt of coronavirus but has since recovered to pre-corona highs after reopening in mid-May.\n\nFerrari is soon to transform into a massively high growth company. The company has announced a plethora of new cars, including a newly announced SUV. Previously, Ferrari strayed away from the SUV realm. However, new management at Ferrari sees vast potential in the SUV market. While the general auto market has seen a decline in output in the past years, the SUV market has seen immense growth. In 2014 SUVs represented 22.4% (16.66M) of the auto market compared to 36.4% (29.77M) in 2018. As Ferrari reaches into this new territory, they are destined to grow as demand for SUVs skyrockets.\n\nIn 2018 Ferrari announced an entirely new product line of cars in addition to their Sport/Special Series and GT series known as the Icona series. The Icona series went on sale in 2019 as a series of very unique limited edition cars that embrace the history of Ferrari. This limited series of cars his highly profitable due to the limited series and helped raise profits in 2019 and will continue to do so in the future.\n\nFerrari has also recently announced a new car that is more accessible to the general public known as the Ferrari Roma. This car is poised to offer competition towards offerings from Porsche for the first time. As Ferrari dives into more accessible pricing brackets, its brand recognition will help them grow immensely. Also, Ferrari has announced plans to enter the electric car market in 2025 and will undoubtedly have success due to the quality of the Ferrari brand. The new emphasis on electric cars comes in stark contrast to the Ferrari of just five years ago, which was uninterested in electric car development.\n\nWith 898 million euro in cash before 2019 and a 650 million euro debt offering released on May 21st, Ferrari has ample liquidity to weather any unforeseen economic downturns. With plants reopened following strict social distancing guidelines and cases in Italy trending lower and lower, Ferrari seems poised to rise over the long-term as they expand into more attractive and accessible market segments. Perhaps Ferrari will take over Porsche or Mercedes as the dominant luxury car manufacturer in the world.\n\nI have no positions in Ferrari or any automaker.", "created_utc": 1591887276.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h10td2/race061120_ferrari_is_becoming_the_new_porsche/", "is_self": true}
