Cases are still spiking, Trade Wars are back on with the Meng bitch making noise in Canada, the Russians and the Saudis are back into pouring oil into the system like a boomer pouring motor oil down the gutter. We still don't have a vaccine and BLMs are still on the street. Nothing has changed and it's not getting better.\n\nMonday red day.\n\nVIX 30C 7/22 (not right now tho, waiting for EoD pump to buy at last minute)", "created_utc": 1593697920.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hjxdzb/time_for_vix_calls_bet_on_postbeer_goggles_monday/", "is_self": true}
