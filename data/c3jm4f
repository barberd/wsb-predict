No I don't talk like that in real life lol", "selftext": "This might help new investors understand why CGC experienced such a harsh selloff today.  Although they are still an incredible company with very unique assets, some more sophisticated investors  may have expressed concerns over some of their recent acquisitions.  Now this of course is not to imply that this company doesn't still present an amazing investment opportunity, just that some prospective investors should educate themselves about some of the hidden risks that could show themselves later down the road.  This relationship visualization is very informative, and helps illustrate the corporate structure.  Hope you enjoy.
