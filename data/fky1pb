I can invest 1200 and keep the rest for necessities . What stocks should i go for\n\n\nEdit:\nThank you all for the advice and thank you to the users who have reached out to me personally. Looks like i will be staying away from the markets for a long time. Is there a specific level of savings I should get to before i consider investing again? I will be taking a job for the time being at Costco or another warehouse while trying to work on my resume and get better options of work.\n\nGod bless all and stay safe during the Quarantines!", "created_utc": 1584568587.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fky1pb/big_loss_any_options/", "is_self": true}
