Assume she just spend all the time fucked on laudanum and cocaine after losing the love of her life.\n\nOn the 1st of January 1968 she runs out of laudanum, remembers Jack's stock tips, and yolos everything into P&amp;G at 1.4 USD a share.\n\nFast forward to 1986, when Citigroup goes public. Rose now has 48,750,000 million and puts 50% into Citigroup at 17.50 USD a share.\n\nWhen Macy's goes public in 1992, she rebalances again.\n\nJP Morgan Chase is created by merger on the 1st of December 1992. At this point, thanks to Citigroup, she's finally beaten inflation and is worth three quarters of a billion.\n\nBy the time Tesla goes public in 2010, something strange happened to the banks and she's down 50 million. No worries, Daddy Elon will save her.\n\nWe now arrive at the present day. Thanks to Tesla, Rose is now worth nearly 6 billion.\n\nHer yearly rate of return over 108 years, inflation-adjusted, should be about 2.5 percent, so even though she did nothing but drugs for 60 years and then relied on stock tips from a dirt-poor artist type I think she still beat [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/)\n\n&gt;!Also I didn't consider stock splits, dividends etc so this might be off by many, many orders of magnitude!&lt;", "created_utc": 1579749957, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/esnegg/if_rose_followed_jacks_stock_tips/", "is_self": true}
