{"id": "h9s37c", "title": "Which major American company is on the brink of bankruptcy?", "selftext": "Everyone knows the fed just started buying individual bonds rather than bond ETFs as they were doing previously. My read is that there are one or more major American companies that are too big to fail, and are becoming unable to sell enough of their bonds to survive. \n\nIn other words, the bond ETF purchases weren't targeted enough to rescue this company on the brink of default. So the fed had to step in and essentially provide a market assisted bailout - where unknowing bondholders help the fed finance the failing company, while the fed holds off the investment banks who have noticed the weakness.\n\nAnyone else have a different interpretation?  Ideas on which CEO called j pow to tell him they were on the brink of default without his direct intervention?\n\n*edit: I guess we could look at who's had their bonds downgraded since March 22, especially if they're now below the BBB-/Baa3 threshold... I might do that myself later tonight if I have time. Any distressed companies are probably being lightly downgraded even with the fed charade.*", "created_utc": 1592265626.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h9s37c/which_major_american_company_is_on_the_brink_of/", "is_self": true}
