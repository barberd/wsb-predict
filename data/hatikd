{"id": "hatikd", "title": "FedEx FDX", "selftext": "FedEx has earnings coming up June 30th. With Ecommerce booming, FedEx has ramped up it's delivery service like they're on steroids. They have had consistent and stable growth every year. Now imagine with beer virus spreading and people shopping online, packages are delivered everywhere 2-3x more than any other year. I don't see it dropping in profits anytime soon with the 2nd wave of beer virus coming. With all the protests going on and Beijing closing again FedEx will keep doing what it's doing for the rest of the year. All in on FedEx.\n\nCalls 7/2 $140", "created_utc": 1592408156.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hatikd/fedex_fdx/", "is_self": true}
