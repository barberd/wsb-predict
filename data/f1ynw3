One year of hemodialysis costs $72,000.\n\nConsidering how fast MSFT is mooning, you could sell both kidneys for $524,000, buy MSFT options, become a multi-millionaire, then get a kidney transplant.  Even two kidney transplants if you want to feel whole again.\n\nHell, even in a post-MSFT era, you could sell both kidneys, get a kidney transplant, pay for a year of hemodialysis, and still have $52,000 left over to throw at FDs.\n\nAnyone know where I can sell kidneys?", "created_utc": 1581375575, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f1ynw3/sell_your_kidneys/", "is_self": true}
