The second leg down of this bear looks as if it will be worse than the first.\u201d\n\nThere have been multiple fund managers, advisors, etc, warning that we will again test the lows. Also, there are many saying we will not again test the lows and we already bottomed. It seems maybe 50/50, I think it is a little closer to 60/40 towards \"experts\" saying we test the lows again...\n\nThis is an excerpt from the article (link below, if you can't figure how to get past a paywall by now I can't help you) \n\n___________\n\n>The S&amp;P 500 surged Monday after New York coronavirus fatalities declined for the first time, while Italy and Spain reported the fewest deaths in more than two weeks. To Peter Cecchini, investors aren\u2019t thinking clearly enough about what it all means.\n\n>As the Cantor Fitzgerald strategist sees it, a lower death rate suggests self-isolation and staying indoors are working. While obviously the best possible news for society, its meaning for markets comes with important caveats, among them the economic cost of prolonging the lockdown.\n\n>\u201cWhat the takeaway should be is that we need to continue this policy, perhaps for even longer than we originally thought,\u201d Cecchini said. \u201cI want to be as optimistic as the next guy about this, but I think we need to be realistic.\u201d\n\n>Right now, some worry, traders are getting ahead of themselves. Shelter-in-place guidelines have already wrecked havoc on retail spending and sparked the biggest plummet in U.S. employment since the last recession. Still to come is a reckoning for debt-laden corporate issuers with ratings at risk.\n\n>The lock-down is economically ruinous -- make no mistake about it,\u201d wrote Charles Dumas at the TS Lombard research shop. \u201cWe have a stock market in denial, very far from any sign of capitulation. The second leg down of this bear looks as if it will be worse than the first.\u201d\n\n>Of course, confidently ascribing any reason for optimism, or pessimism for that matter, has been a fool\u2019s errand in a stock market swinging 5% a day. Forceful sell-offs are met the next day with a strong rallies, and vice versa. Feedback loops are everywhere -- including the bullish possibility that successfully arresting the death rate will put an early end to the most drastic social-distancing protocols.\n\n>But with the S&amp;P 500 extending its gain from the March 23 bottom to 17%, and many attributing the strength to signs of the virus\u2019s spread slowing in hot spots around the globe, the bull case is coming under scrutiny. If virus cases are leveling off, it\u2019s because social distancing is working. The longer people have to remain in their homes, the longer businesses remain shuttered. It\u2019s a conundrum policy makers are speaking to.\n\n>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. recommended trading on what looks to be close to \u201ca favorable inflection\u201d for the spread of the coronavirus. Quantitative and derivatives strategists including Shawn Quigg and Marko Kolanovic suggested clients position for a \u201csharp short squeeze\u201d in value stocks.\n\n>\u201cWith the COVID-19 spread now potentially at an inflection point, the beginning of an economic restart may be closer than anticipated, along with a market trough,\u201d they wrote in a note to clients Monday.\n\n>Peter Tchir at Academy Securities says economic headlines are irrelevant when stacked up against the progression of the virus. To Evercore ISI\u2019s Dennis Debusschere, there\u2019s a possibility that positive stories and headlines -- \u201chuman ingenuity\u201d as he calls is -- could extend the rally, possibly even sending the S&amp;P 500 to 2,800 (a 25% advance from the March lows).\n\n>The impediment to the optimism? \u201cAt some point we will actually have to have a solution,\u201d Debusschere said.\n\nTL;DR: Bull case under scrutiny\n\nPosition: Bearish \n\n[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-06/a-bull-s-conundrum-rally-in-stocks-is-built-on-staying-inside)", "created_utc": 1586286044.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fwqd84/a_bulls_conundrum/", "is_self": true}
