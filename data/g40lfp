{"id": "g40lfp", "title": "CVS calls and stock buys", "selftext": "TLDR: CVS is an option and stock buy, whichever flavor of retard you like.\n\nWall Street will be looking for positivity from CVS as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be April 29, 2020. In that report, analysts expect CVS to post earnings of $1.62 per share. This would mark no growth from the year-ago period.\n\nThis is key because it shows that it will be resilient through the year. The stock will pop on earnings as investors see that this is a \u201crecession proof\u201d stock. \n\nAnyways, we can take advantage.\n\nIf your balls drag: Could care less about theta: ATM 5/1 CALL (you will get fucked)\n\nWorried about theta: ATM 6/19 C\n\nSell options before earnings to skirt IV crush. If you can hehe\n\nStock buying? Have at it retard. Remember to sell high.", "created_utc": 1587266206.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g40lfp/cvs_calls_and_stock_buys/", "is_self": true}
