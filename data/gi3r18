Yeah well unfortunately its always too late, nobody was there to tell you about how good this company would become and supply you with good DD. Well today is your lucky day retards, im here with some crispy piping hot DD that is going to make you so much trendies you wont even have enough dipping sauce for all them. \n\nLow and behold; vectoIQ. TKR $VTIQ. This is the baby that will change your bum life.\n\n\" There's no big news moving the shares of VectoIQ, which at the moment is just a holding company led by former **General Motors** vice chairman Stephen Girsky. Instead, investors seem to be getting excited about the company's [pending merger with Nikola](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/03/03/electric-truck-maker-nikola-motors-to-go-public-fo.aspx) after Nikola confirmed earlier this week that the merger is on track to close in the first two weeks of June. \"\n\nNow if you dont know Nikola, they are a massive statup with huge potential in the field of EV's, especially commercial vehicles. The have a PREORDER sales at 10 billion right now, so when they roll out these first models their stock will be going through the roof with all this guaranteed revenue. \n\nThe merger of these company's is expected to happen around June 2nd, which again will have an absolutely massive pump on this stock. \n\nI planned to write more in this DD but to be honest just google it yourself and you will see many more in-depth articles of why this company will basically be the direct competitor to tesla. This company will be massive and their share price is expected to reach around $200 by the end of the year, and how much is it trading for right now? $20. Oh, and go look at the ticker and see how this stock has been doing this month as people realize how big this company will be,  UP 85% THIS MONTH, UP 50% THIS WEEK & UP 25% TODAY.\n\nThis is it boys, you jump in now or forever regret it. Remember me when you're buying dem cybertrucks. \n\n7/17 $30C LETS FUCKING GO!", "created_utc": 1589256512.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gi3r18/dd_im_about_to_change_your_broke_ass_lifevtiq/", "is_self": true}
