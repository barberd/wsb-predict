{"id": "fgn88c", "title": "Some dumb analyses on the past week", "selftext": "Hi guys, doing some ongoing analysis of our subreddit to try to discover trends, and so far have found something to share (albeit small and maybe not interesting). One thing I looked at were which stocks  had a time interval where they were obsessed over by a relatively small number of people.\n\nMy method was to look at 12-hour time intervals, and look at the ratio of the number of unique posters who mention a stock compared to the total number of mentions that stock had (in each 12-hour interval). My hypothesis is that in a given time window a stock that has a low ratio of unique posters but a high total number of posts might be worth considering as communal obsession.\n\nTL;DR The stocks listed here all had a 12-hour interval where they were talked a lot about by a relatively few number of people (data from this week):\n\n|Ticker|Interval with highest ratio|\n|:-|:-|\n|AMD|1.8601398601398602|\n|COST|1.719178082191781|\n|SIX|1.608695652173913|\n|TSLA|1.5664335664335665|\n|OPK|1.5|\n|DAL|1.4719101123595504|\n|INO|1.4609375000000002|\n|TWTR|1.4455445544554455|\n|AAPL|1.4453125000000002|\n|ZM|1.4347826086956523|\n\nIf you're curious which stocks were talked about the most, here they are:\n\n1. TSLA\n2. DIS\n3. CCL\n4. AMD\n5. COST\n6. SPCE\n7. MSFT\n8. INO\n9. AAPL\n10. AMZN\n\nAnyway, I'll try to post more analytics as I build out my code. I hope to eventually do things like sentiment analysis and stuff like that.", "created_utc": 1583882380.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fgn88c/some_dumb_analyses_on_the_past_week/", "is_self": true}
