{"id": "fgh66o", "title": "Mortgages: one last hit for fiending bulls", "selftext": "For all the bulls wandering wsb and fiending for just one more hit, I'm here to share my last dime bag.\n\n\nLet's start with what has happened recently:\n\n* When stonks go down, bond prices go up and bond yields go down. Mortgage rates go down with bond yields because they compete for the same low-risk investors.\n* When the Fed cuts rates, bond yields go down (usually). We\u2019ve seen this happen so far and I believe we can expect it to continue with further cuts.\n* [Refinance applications spiked 26% last week](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/mortgage-refi-applications-rise-26-with-further-gains-likely) and are expected to continue to increase as rates fall.\n\n\nWhat could happen moving forward:\n\n* The Fed will continue to cut rates; the idea that they may even go to 0 or negative is not unrealistic given that other developed countries crossed this line a long time ago and [Trump is already calling for it](https://thehill.com/policy/finance/486775-trump-ramps-up-pressure-on-fed-to-cut-rates). This would absolutely juice refi and purchase mortgages alike.\n* Coronavirus spreads and kills a lot of boomers. Boomers own the most homes \u2013 [78% of those aged 65+ own homes vs. just 36.5% of those under 35](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2018/08/homeownership-by-age.html). All those boomer homes will be hitting the market, freeing up inventory at the same time as mortgage rates fall drastically. What this means is that all of those millennials who have been locked out of the market are suddenly looking at a realistic path to home ownership, and in some areas of the country, will probably be looking at a mortgage payment that is lower than their rent.\n* Given this bullish scenario for mortgage lenders and boomers\u2019 desperate search for a safe haven for their money, I think we may see an unusual scenario where the demand for safe investments (MBS) keep mortgage rates \u201chigh\u201d relative to bond yields, leaving more room for profit for lenders, but low enough that they still look very attractive to potential homebuyers.\n* If this all plays out, these stocks will be spiking even higher when investors flock to the few stonks that are going up in a falling market.\n\n\nSo what are the moves? I\u2019m looking mainly at mortgage lenders, who originate the loan; mortgage servicers, who facilitate collection of payment; and auxiliary businesses like mortgage insurance and title/escrow providers.\n\n* PFSI (lender): Zacks strong buy, trading at low P/E\n* IMH (lender): Upcoming earnings March 20 I think could be a strong earnings beat based on refi surge\n* MTG (mortgage insurance): Since everyone here works in fast food I will assume you\u2019ve never bought a house and as an FYI, mortgage insurance is required on your mortgage when you put down less than 20%. Most buyers taking advantage of newly low rates to enter the market likely won\u2019t have the cash to put down 20% and will need this insurance.\n* OCN (servicer): CEO just bought a bunch of shares. Dirt cheap.\n* FNF (title/escrow services): RSI looks good.\n\n**TL;DR rates down, mortgages up. Boomers die, mortgages up. Buy 3/20 or 4/17 calls on stocks listed above.**\n\nBe aware that some of these are relatively low volume but there aren\u2019t that many publicly traded stocks in this sector that don\u2019t also have exposure to broader banking, which I am bearish on.", "created_utc": 1583860118.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fgh66o/mortgages_one_last_hit_for_fiending_bulls/", "is_self": true}
