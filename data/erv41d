{"id": "erv41d", "title": "Serious SWOT analysis of $SPCE.", "selftext": "I did some business studies in High School so I am qualified to do serious SWOT analysis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**STRENGHTS**\n\n* First to market.  Virgin Galactic will be the first company to mass market a flight up to low orbit to experience zero gravity and views of the Earth. \n* They will lean a huge amount about sending passengers to space which they can use for hypersonic travel.\n* They are the only company specialising in space tourism at the moment. SpaceX goal is Mars and actual space. Blue Origin still has a lot of work to do.\n* 2 spaceplanes built with 3 more planned. Tried and tested spaceplanes.\n* Virgin Galactic brand recognition is high.\n* There are synergies with Virgin Airlines, Infrastructure and operating procedures for mass passenger transportation are already developed with Virgin Airlines.\n* $500m dollars in cash in the bank. Low debt obligations.\n\n  \n**WEAKNESSES**\n\n* They don't appear (publicity anyway) to have a clear plan or timeline for space tourism flights or hypersonic travel. \n* Branson has been promising commercial fights for the last 10 years with no results yet.  The next flight is always 6 months away according to Branson.\n* They still require vast amounts of investment to get to hypersonic travel.\n* Unclear profit margins for space tourism. 250k a ticket may not be enough to cover costs of launches.\n* Limited market at 250k a ticket.\n* Only offers 4 minutes of actual zero gravity. Can get more with a controlled stall in an airplane.\n* Doesn't reach the international definition of space.\n\n  \n**OPPORTUNITIES**\n\n* Brand new market. Unable to value or predict how big space industry will be. $SPCE could be the next meme stock bumped up to the moon with magic.\n* Hypersonic travel will be a game changer. It will vastly reduce travel times and will disrupt traditional airlines once it becomes affordable.\n* Space hotels and asteroid mining will bring in big money eventually.\n\n  \n**THREATS**\n\n* Single point of catastrophic failure.  If a spaceplane blows up or Richard Branson dies then SPCE will tank to such a point it may be unrecoverable.\n* A competitor offering vertical launch (via a rocket) may offer a far more exiting prospect of exploring space for a tourist. \n* Space tourism just may not be a good profit earner. Running the company in to the ground whilst they try and develop a hypersonic passenger vehicle.\n* Can easily be overtaken by a competitor such as SpaceX should they decide to enter space tourism on a mass level.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Analyst prediction: Keep your finger on the sell button when Branson boards the first flight.**", "created_utc": 1579615530, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/erv41d/serious_swot_analysis_of_spce/", "is_self": true}
