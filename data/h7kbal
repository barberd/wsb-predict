{"id": "h7kbal", "title": "Bull Case for FMCI, Announced Merger with Tattooed Chef (Plant-based Food)", "selftext": "FMCI and FMCIW dipped on the announcement, good time to buy in.\n\nlf you have been watching this SPAC, I\u2019m sure many of you were rooting for Impossible Foods because you saw a conspiracy theory Twitter. We didn\u2019t get Impossible Foods, but may have gotten something better.\n\nI had never heard of Tattoed Chef, so I took a deeper look. 2020 $150M projected revenue, $222M in 2021 and so on. EV is 2x the $222M revenue. Additionally, FMCI at it\u2019s current price around $13.50 is a $345M market cap. \n\nThis revenue is great. BYND is trading at more than 10x its 2021 projected revenue. \n\nFirst and most important point: this is the only way for investors who aren\u2019t in BYND to enter this market, at a much cheaper rate. \n\nFMCI shareholders will retain 20% of the company. That\u2019s actually much higher than other SPACs like VTIQ and DEAC, where there was a 5-10% retention. Less dilution for FMCI. \n\nAt FMCI\u2019s current price, the market cap of the combined company is slightly over 7x that revenue. This is a lower multiple than BYND. I expect this to hit $20+ a share very easily. If FOMO hits hard it could go even bigger.\n\nDon\u2019t sell off because you had a nonsensical hope that we were getting one company, when you got another solid one.", "created_utc": 1591967054.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h7kbal/bull_case_for_fmci_announced_merger_with_tattooed/", "is_self": true}
