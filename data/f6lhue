{"id": "f6lhue", "title": "Wash Sale Questions", "selftext": "Two questions, hoping someone may know the answer to one or both of them:\n\n1.) If one were to sell a security for a profit that was a long term investment, and then within 30 days of this sale commit a wash sale of the same security, would any losses on the wash sale going forward still be categorized as the \"long term capital\" variety with gains being considered short term gains?\n\n2.) Does anyone have any recent information regarding wash sales and what constitutes as a \"substantially identical fund\" from the SEC or other reliable sources? For example, does QQQ and QQQE count as being substantially identical? I understand that swapping an ETF with another that tracks the same index from a different issuer (*i.e.* Vanguard vs. Schwab) would violate the substantially identical rule. However I am not finding a lot of information about this specific situation since the funds mentioned above are weighted differently, have different expense ratios, different average volumes, etc.\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated.
