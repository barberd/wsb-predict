Here\u2019s what I know from my dd:\n\nOkay so the problem with the 737 Max isn\u2019t that it has a structural issue. On its own, even without MCAS, it could fly fine if the pilot was appropriately-trained. Boeing wanted the Max to have the same type rating as the previous 737, the 737 NG so that Pilots would not need additional training to fly the Max. However, due to the position of the engines on the Max, lift was created when the plane was flying at a high angle of attack. (A lot of people are still thinking this makes the plane dysfunctional, it does not.) This only makes the MAX fly differently from the 737 NG, which means pilots would require additional training to fly the Max. To prevent this, the MCAS software was designed to correct this lift so that flying the MAX would feel identical to flying the 737 NG. The MCAS\u2018s correction was too great and resulted in the crashes. So where do we go from here now that the software is fixed? Will the FAA re-certify the Max and not require any additional training for pilots? Will they require that the Max change its type rating? Or will I go $rope because my calls expire 1/31?", "created_utc": 1577423539, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eg6s6d/should_i_hold_onto_ba_calls/", "is_self": true}
