But to those of us who occasionally buy the underlying asset, listen up. \n\nMake sure you understand which block of shares you're broker is going to sell before you place that limit order. I recently screwed up on my TDA account and set my tax lot method to \"highest cost\". Which you might think means you'll sell your highest cost shares, right? Wrong. That means you're going to sell your shares that will result in the highest tax cost to you. This is how I accidentally sold all my SPY shares that I recently bought at $229 instead of the, you know, SHARES WITH THE HIGHEST COST! I mean, I can't be too mad because I did make a profit on the trade but I was trying average down and I really wanted to keep those $229 shares. \n\nBut if bear gang is right then maybe i'll have another chance to buy in at $229.\n\nTLDR: 100 shares of SPY at $229 on margin.", "created_utc": 1585939793.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fue1nz/understand_which_block_of_shares_youre_about_to/", "is_self": true}
