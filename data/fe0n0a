{"id": "fe0n0a", "title": "Unusual Options - CCL/HAL/BABA/EBAY/GOLD", "selftext": "Today I included the aggressive orders, CCL seems really aggressive going way OTM.\n\nThese  options orders  are on or above the ask. Many have the same expiry and  strike. Also lots  of the orders were sweeps so these ppl were  breaking  down their order to get filled faster.\n\nAlso  all  these orders volume of the contracts exceeded the open  interest     in   multiple trades so it's most likely not closing  positions.   Either    buy     to  open orders or sell to open orders and  based on   the    aggressiveness  of the orders one can infer its buy to  open.  Some  of     these may be    hedges  and some most likely not.\n\nData is here - [https://ibb.co/DgL2N3q](https://ibb.co/DgL2N3q)\n\nThis is just some of today's orders, i know it is late in the day but I am doing the best I can do right now to post these.\n\nThe  CCL orders are very aggressive with so many sweeping orders especially all puts going way OTM. Go out further than the weeklies for any of these unless yoloing. Also watch WYNN/WY/GOLD/and the others.\n\nDon't  just enter YOLO's in positions based on this data alone in most cases.  Use  technicals/fundamentals/options data/market feelings all combined   instead of just 1 of these.   Use protection like  spreads if you worry   about losing what u   put in     and    be  smart,  understand the  risks of putting $ into weekly  expiry's, consider a longer expiry.\n\nAlso with the market going lower use technicals/fundamentals/options data-flow/market  sediment all combined.\n\nI wanted to add, 50 Cent VIX trader ruffer llp (or whatever) is still holding their vix calls as of 3-5-20.\n\nAlso, someone said ibb has ads so use an adblocker we are in 2020", "created_utc": 1583436890.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fe0n0a/unusual_options_cclhalbabaebaygold/", "is_self": true}
