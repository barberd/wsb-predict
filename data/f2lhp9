Part 1: Bought 30x 3/20 IBM 145c's at 0.43 the day it was announced that shit CEO everyone hates was resigning and that second coming of nadella would take over as ceo. I revenge traded back into this position because I had 50x IBM 3/20 150c's I had bought before ER and didn't sell after their massive ER beat because I got greedy and then the virus hit. Anyways, got super lucky and sold off the 30 contracts in batches. Sold the last batch of calls I had left (5x) at 9.0. Made about 10k on this play. \n\nPart 2: I then had 8x 3/20 AMZN 2200c's I had bought averaged at 5.50 ish going into ER. Sold 3 after the ER jump and sold one today and have 4x left (up 15k on those 4x). I became absolutely convinced that AMZN was going to run like crazy like AAPL and MSFT did and told myself it was going to be the trade of the year and that I was not going to fucking miss this trade of the year. So I just started loading the boat with conviction with all kinds of calls: feb, march, april, and june expirations with all kinds of strikes since last week. I took profit on a call on Monday (unfortunately a 2/14 2050c, which went from 21.0 to 55.0: now at 114.0), but immediately replaced it with an april 2100c (for 79.0). Tuesday I sold a call for profit and just bought a new one with june exp. Everytime I took profit I just went ahead and bought another call. I didn't trade this perfectly. I've left an additional 30k ish on the table. But big gains. 60k of that 93k has been since Friday. up 20k on friday, another 20k monday, and another 22k today. \n\nThere've been a few other plays here and there for 1k-4k. The best part is the 93k include a realized 7k loss I took on BIDU shares I'd been bagholding for a fucking  year. Feels so good to be free of that and have even more cash to yolo. :) Withdrew 20k today. \n\nI made another 7k in my robinhood account:  https://imgur.com/azfdAJp  Nearly all the same plays but smaller position size.", "created_utc": 1581481658, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f2lhp9/98k_in_3_months/", "is_self": true}
