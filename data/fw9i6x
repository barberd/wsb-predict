Somehow, I ended up on a shit ton of posts about complaints with banks and customer service lines then it hit me harder than my daddy ever dropped me as a kid...\n\nI. Figured. It. Out. \n\nIt was clear as heck, they literally posted it up for us to see, and none of us saw it except the boomers who could actually read (I don't blame most of us, most of us can barely read).\n\nAll this virus news going around and we're still losing money on our puts (talking about you Chad and that last $69 YOLO you had). Why? It's not because of the slow down in death rates, JPow going brrrr, or even bull news on the oil dick measuring contest. It's because everyone wants CALLS and even boomers are willing to die just to get one.\n\nNow I know what you're thinking, \"What do you mean everyone wants calls? We've all been buying puts!\" Well guess what, every time we've tried getting a put, we'd have it in seconds with no issues at all. But have you tried getting a call? I tried calling Chase customer support, United customer support, etc. and every single one of them had me on hold for hours. What does that mean? It means all these lines are jammed with boomers trying to get a damn call and rather than getting medical help, they're willing to be on the line for hours while on deaths doorstep just to have Rajesh on the other end drop their call. Every single support page has posted that it can take HOURS to just get one CALL. THEY LITERALLY POSTED NOTICES THAT CALLS WERE THE WAY and the demand was so great there would be huge delays. In fact, they're getting so swamped that lil daddy JPow is giving them money just to make sure they have enough lines open to keep giving out calls. \n\nNot sure how much longer this is going to go on for but the moment they start removing those post notices on wait times, that's when we start buying puts.", "created_utc": 1586215839.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fw9i6x/they_were_literally_telling_us_about_calls/", "is_self": true}
