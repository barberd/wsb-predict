{"id": "fop2bl", "title": "Buy Tesla", "selftext": "Short sellers lose on Tesla. Period. Sure people picked up cash on puts during this crash, but that was universal. Will there be volatility? 100%. \n\nTesla has a TON of cash. Between their credit lines (which was extended in FEB with borderline clairvoyance) and cash reserves we are talking about 8.5B. \n\nTesla\u2019s competition has been crushed. Ford / GM/ Fiat, they all have higher operations expenses (I.E. dealerships / union workers pensions, high employee counts, etc.). \n\nBelieve it or not, Tesla has the best ability to fair in this storm. When the storm settles their competition will be hurting far worse. \n\nThey are using this time to EXPAND. Other manufactures are overproducing vehicles, Tesla needs to increase output to meet demand. That\u2019s a good spot. \n\nTesla also has a great footprint and relationship with the very hard market of China (which will buy MAD vehicles and they won\u2019t be Ford). I mean PR or not Elon essentially mocked the CV by purchasing ventilators from the source of the virus as overstock and delivered them to the US. Those 1.25k ventilators are now 25% of the ventilators delivered to NYC. \n\nNot to mention, future ventures in solar, insurance (leveraging driver data), vehicle autonomy software, ride share. Space??\n\nBuy Tesla. It ignores the rules of the market and has the potential to still hit 1k a share before EOY and could be worth 4K a share before 2024. \n\nTesla is a true WSB even simply buying shares. If you think you can time it with calls, god bless. It will either skyrocket or it will crash and burn with the rest of us.", "created_utc": 1585137472.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fop2bl/buy_tesla/", "is_self": true}
