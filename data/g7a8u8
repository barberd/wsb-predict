{"id": "g7a8u8", "title": "Doubling \"The Wheel\" strategy to collect 2x the premium? (Theta Gang)", "selftext": "Most of you are probably familiar with \"the wheel\" strategy where you sell cash secured puts (CSP) to eventually enter a long position, then once assigned begin selling covered calls (CC) on the underlying. Creating a nice cycle for collecting premium with limited risk. Now double it.\n\n# The Strategy:\n\n1. What I'm suggesting to do instead is to sell a naked straddle to enter either a long or short position on the underlying. With this, you do not care about the directionality of the underlying, however, if you had a bullish or bearish bias the strategy could be modified to favor a direction - I'll get into this below.\n2. Let's assume after selling the naked straddle you were assigned on the put and you're now long 100 shares of SPY. You'd begin selling 2 OTM calls on the position. 1 of these calls is a covered call with the 100 shares you're long, the other call is naked. If the underlying breaches through the strike price at expiration you're going to have your 100 long shares get called away from the CC but then end up short 100 shares from the naked call.\n3. Now that you're short 100 shares on the underlying you begin selling 2 OTM puts on the position. 1 of these puts is covered with the 100 short shares, the other put is naked. If the underlying breaches through the strike price at expiration you're going to have the 100 share short position closed by the covered put but then end up 100 shares long again from the naked put.\n\nThis process gets repeated just like The Wheel, only with 2x the premium on the same sized underlying position. This obviously doesn't come without increased risk.\n\n# Adjustments to the Strategy:\n\nMuch like with The Wheel strategy, you'd likely be selling the options at 30-45 DTE to capture a lot of that accelerating theta decay at about .30, -.30 deltas.\n\nHowever, let's say the underlying is SPY and you're long term bullish, you'd want to maximize the amount of time that you're long the underlying and minimize the amount of time you're short.\n\nYou would continue to sell your \\~.30 delta calls however, if the strike price was breached you would roll the short calls up and out to continue to capture more of the underlying's upside while trying to get them to expire worthless rather than take the assignment and end up short on the underlying.\n\nIf you did get assigned and ended up short the underlying you could instead sell much shorter duration puts (weeklies) and instead of selling the -.30 deltas, you could bring the strike to ATM. Enabling you to collect more premium for the ATM strike but also increasing the likelihood of assignment quickly and returning to your long position on the underlying. If the market did happen to take a turn and you wanted to quickly capture the downside, you could of course roll those puts down and out.\n\n# Additional Thoughts:\n\nThis strategy obviously brings about more risk due to the short calls/puts so it might limit the underlyings you'd be willing to trade. A big earnings move against you could wipe out a few months worth of the premium selling so you'd probably want to stick to the more stable/liquid ETF's and long term stable blue chips.\n\nBy selling 2x the premium you're much more cushioned for a move against your underlying. For example: Let's say you're short the SPY shares during a nice bull run.\n\nSPY is currently at 280 and you're short but you've just sold 7 DTE puts ATM which are sitting at 5.30 right now. You collect the 10.60 in premium so if SPY moves up against your short position, you don't see a loss until SPY breaks above 290.60 within that 7 day window.\n\nWould love some feedback on this, tell me where I'm either wrong or failing to account for something.
