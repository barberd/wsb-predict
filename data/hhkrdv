Back in late April when the tide was turning for the bulls, I decided it was the perfect time to go short the market... I knew very little about time decay at that point which honestly may have saved me from following the rest of my gay bears to -100%. I ALMOST turned bull in May, but I knew if I sold the market would go down. Theta gang has fucked me so far but I  bet on the idiocy of my fellow Americans and it may still pay off. My puts expire after Q3 earnings so there's plenty of time. I'm planning on selling before JPOW announces the Fed is taking SPY private at 500.", "created_utc": 1593372769.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hhkrdv/still_holding_puts_that_i_bought_back_in_april/", "is_self": true}
