I'm here to argue that these mitigation methods also stop other diseases, meaning it will be hard to argue against continued use of them.\n\nYou really think people won't be urged to wear masks during the next flu season?  Or that companies are going to risk an \"outbreak\" in their offices just so everyone in the office can hear karen talk on the phone all day?\n\nGoing forward, i'm going to create a Demolition Man index, consisting mostly of Taco Bell stock.\n\n**Edit:** Because I see a lot of responses like, \"nobody will be afraid of the flu\".  \n\nDid you know that you're a complete utter fucking pussy compared to your fathers fathers father?  That's right, no matter how tough you are compared to your friends.  Your great great grandfather could kick your little fag ass in two seconds.  \n\nHow is that possible?  Technological progression.  \n\nAs technology progresses, things get easier for the average joe; which makes the men softer every generation.  Your grandfather killed some Vietcong with his gun?
