Cybersecurity solutions are in high demand as everyone works from home and the world goes digital. Comps like Fortinet and Cloudflare have filled gaps since falling to their recent lows and have risen beyond pre-Covid highs, but PANW has so far been lagging behind. I expect a nice run up to ER on 5/21 (lots of time!) and excellent guidance.\n\n**KPI**\n\nThe name of the game is recurring revenue. Software companies pivoting to this business model see the most success. For PANW, revenue is made up of product (legacy hardware) and services. Billings (Revenue + change in deferred revenue for the period) is a non-GAAP metric for SaaS companies that more effectively tracks its actual revenue increase because it accounts for the differences in the way its two components are used in GAAP accounting.\n\nIn PANW's most recently reported quarter, the company saw \n\nProduct Revenue: (9%), \n\nService Revenue: +30%\n\nBillings: +17%\n\nPANW explains that it literally asked and incentivized its staff to sell more services rather than legacy  hardware because they are shifting their business model to focus on recurring revenue. But this is only a short-lived downside because we are seeing growth in the right places - more billings.\n\nAdditionally, PANW has an enormous marketing spend that it has been deploying to get its new business lines out to clients. This has been crumbling its operating margin, but when you are the largest player in your sector and are switching your business model to selling recurring revenue products, I think this marketing spend is fully justifiable and will downtrend soon, especially with the string of acquisitions PANW has taken on (most recently CloudGenix) to fuel recurring revenue growth. \n\n**TRACTION**\n\nEven with the fall in product revenue and huge marketing spend, PANW has been beating on EPS the last few quarters. Growing comps like FTNT, NET, have taken off, reporting tremendous growth this quarter not expected for such a large and established player like PANW. However, with PANW's new lines of business and huge marketing spend at the right time due to Covid, I think we will be in for a surprise and superior guidance. \n\nThe recent CloudGenix acquisition is also favorable because it closed amidst the pandemic and compliments the move into cloud services and WFH software capabilities (CloudGenix uses SD-WAN, which makes this easier) for recurring revenue growth, showing strength. Also, a $1bn share buyback initiated last year to supplement a $1bn share buyback from the year before has not been suspended amidst Covid, displaying more strength. \n\nIf smaller, growing companies with less channel partners and sales network were able to deploy their new products out during Covid, I believe an established player like PANW with large marketing focus and acquisitions for the relevant cybersecurity offerings will be able to do the same and should not be slept on. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:** PANW is a powerhouse in cybersecurity, has been beating even with falling legacy hardware sales and increase marketing spend, been actually improving in the right places and achieving more recurring revenue growth at these costs, also making the right acquisitions for Covid-relevant offerings, still a while till ER 5/21.\n\n**Positions:** 5/22 $240c", "created_utc": 1589305683.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gig91i/panw_largest_cybersecurity_stonk_dd_er_521/", "is_self": true}
