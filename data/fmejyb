Why did I do this retarded thing? How did I do it? Did I see it coming? If I saw it coming why didn\u2019t I buy more? What is this autist shit?\n\nI will tell you. I saw nothing coming. I am lazy and retarded. And I know this about myself. But I\u2019d work all night if it meant nothing would have to be done for the rest of the time. \n\nI tail hedge. Every single month I buy 30% otm SPY puts with ~.5% (a little less) of my account. And every single month I just... sit on them. And watch them expire. \n\nOccasionally I\u2019ll get in a mood to sell at a loss for some reason so I\u2019ll actually try to sell my .2 options, and I fucking TRIED to do that with my 3/20 puts but lucky for me they didn\u2019t sell. Could you fucking imagine? \n\nNow I know what you\u2019re thinking: this guy is retarded. He\u2019s just throwing money away every month and he happen to get lucky because of the kung flu\n\nI won\u2019t deny the retarded. I don\u2019t like math, I don\u2019t have the energy to read half the shit or do the DD on every single trade I make. But guess what? Even before my puts started printing I was still up about 20% all time.\n\nHow did an autist do this? Well like 90% of my account was in SPY as it was mooning. And I constantly have a -10% stop loss order to sell all of it\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what happened here. I go days without checking my account usually. And then suddenly, for a week I get 3 hours of sleep and watch that spy ticker until I sell. \n\n\nThis is not the cucked investing you find in personal finance or investing \u201cAlwAyS a GoOD tiMe tO bUy\u201d  nor is it pure Chad Yolos. It\u2019s both, it\u2019s neither, it\u2019s... beautiful. For retards who know they\u2019re retards, thinks everyone else is also a retard and is just too lazy to DD every single trade this is it. Not to say I don\u2019t have the occasional YOLO but it\u2019s always with a small amount and never with any actual reason.  Because no matter what, any reason could potentially be bullshit. \n\nBut this market still goin down. \n\nTL;DR: SPY 130p 4/15 and tail hedge", "created_utc": 1584795388.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmejyb/how_i_turned_100_into_10k_doubling_portfolio/", "is_self": true}
