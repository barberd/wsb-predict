I would tell many here that paid gurus are not worth it - buy quality and hold.  The 3 services were Warrior, Black Ink Economics and Ricky's noob chat with natgas.  Gamble at the casino and invest in only quality as this is your hard-earned money.", "created_utc": 1579475865, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/er45le/i_have_tried_3_paid_services_and_not_impressed/", "is_self": true}
