Everyone has a camera. Every riot, shooting, and violence is rapidly spread on social media. Fear drives gun sales and increases stock sentiment.  People are scared, people want to protect their businesses, protect themselves from the government, etc., etc.\n\nNot to mention the FBI has reported a significant increase in firearm background checks, with almost 3 million gun permit associated in April. This is the fourth highest its been since statistics on this have been kept, and March shattered the overall record with 3.7 million firearm background checks. It\u2019s no secret that the pandemic is the primary cause, but this demonstrates the strength and overall movement we will likely see in the coming weeks for gun manufacturers as consumers react to the violence on their televisions, social media, etc. \n\n[https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/nics\\_firearm\\_checks\\_-\\_month\\_year.pdf/view](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/nics_firearm_checks_-_month_year.pdf/view)\n\nRuger & Company (RGR) is a prime example of this, for Q1 they reported net sales of $123.6 million\n\nPositions: \n\n$SWBI 14.5C 6/12\n\n$SWBI 15C 6/12\n\n$RGR 67.5C 6/19\n\n$VSTO 12.5c 6/19\n\nI\u2019m going to be playing some short term calls for now and eventually move toward long-term calls as I\u2019m confident earnings for Q2 will dwarf Q1 and lead to some juicy tendies. \n\nLike I said I\u2019m retarded, but I\u2019ve noticed no one\u2019s really discussed this here so if some smart people want to chime in go ahead, but I\u2019m counting on fear and uncertainty to moon gun manufacture stocks.\n\nTLDR: Calls on SWBI, RGR, VSTO", "created_utc": 1591043772.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gusggf/gun_stocks_dd/", "is_self": true}
