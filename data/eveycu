The introduction of coronavirus into the most bullish stock market and economy of all time presents an interesting opportunity where I feel that we can predict a market downturn as well as the timing of said downturn, with just a little old fashioned psychology, and publicly available facts.\n\n\n\n#Predicting the future is hard\n\nI do not know how many people will die from Coronavirus. I do not know the eventual death rate. I do not know the probability of a full scale pandemic. Neither does anybody else, really. So this point does not stand against me. \n\n#Predicting the mob is easy.\n\nPeople read the news, still. This news seeps into their mind and subtly changes the way their fingers interact with their big swinging hedge fund dicks, and Robinhood portfolios. Hedge fund managers definitely still read the news, even if you autists don't. What's my point? The news media is wildly misrepresenting the current situation with the Coronavirus. Dipshit journalists will cite things like \"the flu infects more people than corona\" or \"death rate of only 3%\" as if these are not wildly naive statistical calculations. What's my point? When corona has infected more people than SARS(should be the case in just 2-3 days), you will see very panicky headlines stating that fact. When the US shuts all travel to China, journalists will likewise create a broad sense of panic. People will take to social media and become aware of the scale. This will create an atmosphere of panic. When the virus starts to slow down, and things are actually getting better, in a twist of irony, the sample mortality rate will creep up. This is a basic statistical fact -- as the growth remains high, the mortality rate will be understated as the population is predominated by relatively more healthy recently infected persons, and as the growth rate slows, the mortality rate will approach reality. \n\nAs these facts become more widely known, optimism will turn to panic. Future surprises with Coronavirus to be negative! That is the nature of this kind of thing. Dr. Taleb has done some great work on this subject which I recommend.\n\n#Coronavirus will have some impact on S&amp;P 500. \n\nThe fed is pumping money to all time highs. We are in the most bullish stock market of all time. All we need is a little fear, and the change in animal spirits will be self-reinforcing. The economy is slowing despite the roaring stock market. In addition we have the real economic impact of shutting down large parts of China, cancelling travel between countries, etc. Even a small change to absolute GDP can mean a  relatively significant change to a quarterly growth rate figure, which is what moves the markets.\n\n#Will Coronavirus spread to Europe and the USA in a significant way?\n\nI hope not. I don't think my thesis depends on it. I'm not here to fearmonger. However, I absolutely recommend taking minor medical precautions with some awareness that this is a possibility. For instance, if you are a gross person who does not wash their hands, maybe now is the time to learn. (don't sell your 401ks people!!)\n\n#What is the timing of these puts?\n\nSeeing as how the virus has to slow down in the next 40 days or infection rates will be higher than the entire world population, you are safe with puts that far out. I am going a little earlier, because I feel that surpassing SARS will be a critical psychological point. What strike? Fuck if I know. Go with something that's not too hot, not too cold, just right. The baby bear amount. (whose name has been unrightfully stolen by that human bitch Goldilocks who steals from innocent bears!!)\n\n#Should I listen to you?\n\nAbsolutely not. I am a dipshit with an internet connection, not Mr. Dow Jones himself.", "created_utc": 1580258831, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eveycu/whipped_up_some_gay_bear_panic_dd_for_you_all/", "is_self": true}
