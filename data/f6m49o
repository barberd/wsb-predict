After hearing his prophecy, I started building a spaceship. After building it, I figured I would also need to watch something while traveling. I then launched into space and I arrived on the moon. After arriving, I decided to give a quick visit to Bill Gates, but he wasn't home. So, I parked my spaceship on the moon and I delivered the parcel of tendies to my account. \n\nI couldn't buy calls for STMP because I needed around 5k in the account for options and margin account. I didn't expect STMP to go that high, but I'm not complaining about that 800$ gain. I sold all of my STMP right after their earnings report. \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/yXNzBmC](https://imgur.com/a/yXNzBmC)", "created_utc": 1582166204, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6m49o/interplanetary_mailman_made_800_in_2_hours/", "is_self": true}
