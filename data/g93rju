This shows what has happened inside a recession and what has happened after the recession.\n\n\\- Note areas of spread compression or expansion between trends. This gives you a timeline for the moves.\n\n\\- If we assume that some metals (i.e. GOLD) are more influenced by speculators than others (i.e. PLATINUM), platinum seems to be a proper baseline for projections.\n\n\\- G/S should zig-zag for a while, then come down (Yellow line).\n\n\\- P/S should come down soon (Grey line).\n\n\\- G/P should zig-zag for a while, then come down (Blue line).\n\nConclusions (TL, DR), which of course, are not financial advice:\n\n\\- Short P/S ratio.\n\n\\- Short G/S ratio\n\n\\- Short G/P ratio.\n\n\\- G/P to P/S spread should narrow significantly after P/S makes a move down.\n\n\\- The above do not account for all the printing and changes on industrial use of the years, so trade accordingly. This is important because it either artificially affects prices or affect supply and demand of each metal.\n\n\\- Note that P/S hasn\u2019t moved yet, so monitor the trades (I would be Delta neutral until this thing starts to move), hedge volatility, and save for Uncle Sam. Or do otherwise, I don\u2019t care.", "created_utc": 1588004210.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g93rju/play_of_metals/", "is_self": true}
