{"id": "f2qg26", "title": "Futures YOLO potential", "selftext": "Ok ok so huge returns via futures is only possible in two ways: trading a 100k account on crude or funding 5k in an Amp Futures account and trading 10 lots on $NQ\\_F. Ok lemme lemme put this into a little more perspective for you retards. ONE $NQ\\_F contract via td ameritrade goes for $6,000. ONE $NQ\\_F contract with Amp Futures goes for $500. You can put a fucking 10 lot on for $5,000 via Amp and that same position size via TD goes for $66 fucking thousand dollars. ITS ALMOST AS IF AMP WANTS YOU TO BLOW UP. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStill not getting it? Ok so you have a 10lot on of $NQ\\_F and you will make (or lose) $200 a handle. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReally, you still don't see what I am saying? From yesterdays lows its up 80 handles. Lets do math retards. Whats 200x80? So yeah fuck off TD. If you want to YOLO with futures please throw your money away via Amp Futures. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd remember kids! You can lose more than you put in with futures and your dumb asses will be liquidated if you're down 80% on the position.
