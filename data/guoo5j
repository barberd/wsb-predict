This stock looks like it\u2019s exactly higher lows for the last 3 months but it\u2019s all driven by hype and disillusionment.\n\nHere\u2019s what I know. Most people aren\u2019t a paid subscriber. For example, from the info I\u2019ve collected so far, 18/20 school districts that I had contact with are not on a paid plan. In fact, three of the local school districts in my area in the East Bay held fiscal meetings on Zoom, but they would tell everyone in the beginning of the meeting that there is a 45 minute limit and the meeting will close - that we would have to wait for another think to rejoin. That\u2019s basically another way of saying, we ain\u2019t paying for this shit. We on that free free. \n\nOn the topic of education, tutoring is a big income stream for ZM. A lot of tutors hosting 1-2 hour lessons actually pay for the professional option. My son and daughter\u2019s tutors can host Zoom lessons for 2 hours without interruption for that reason. But just recently, both tutors are saying that they are preferring to meet in person now so save the cost of doing Zoom lessons. They said most tutors are returning in person lessons and that it should be safe to do so. So, there you have it. Another sector that is breaking off from Zoom. \n\nFor tech businesses which I\u2019m directly associated with, some do pay for zoom and others don\u2019t. Had a 2.5 hour conference with a partnering tech company a week ago and they had us rejoin with a new link twice. You would think a tech company would just buy a professional account if not better to host meetings, but no. For my company, I know that our plan is set to be canceled by end of June since people are heading back to work. \n\nMoreover, let\u2019s take a look at ZM vs competitors. \nSkype fucked it up. Their one big moment and they busted too early. Google Meets/Hangouts has an incredibly simple UI and extended functions that work with Google\u2019s numerous applications. Cisco webex, Google Hangouts, Jitsi Meet, Slack, Microsoft Teams to name a few are all doing virtually the same things. Nothing novel about ZM other than the frequent security issues. \n\nCompany is currently valued at 57B where 3 months ago it was worth around 10B. The shelter in place was great, but it\u2019s about time ZM gets a big correction. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this dips below $100 by July.", "created_utc": 1591032018.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/guoo5j/zm_will_lose_30_by_mid_june/", "is_self": true}
