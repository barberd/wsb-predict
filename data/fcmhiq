Kosmos expects to retain a higher interest in Mauritania and Senegal\nManagement made the strategic decision to retain a higher stake in its Mauritania and Senegal assets, by holding a larger stake in Tortue. Between the three hubs - Tortue, Birallah and Yakaar Teranga, KOS expected 30 mtpa of LNG capacity to be constructed. The company now expects to retain 5 mtpa of LNG exposure, primarily through a larger stake in Tortue while using the expected asset sales process to fund additional capital spend requirements. While KOS had previously targeted a sale of 20% of the asset (leaving them with a 10% ownership), targeting 5 mtpa of LNG implies the sale of ~13% of the assets (and retaining a ~17% stake). The sales process at Mauritania/Senegal is still in progress; management has seen discussions with different buyer pools including end users, utilities and supermajors.\n\n2. Capital spend requirements to increase post drawdown of the BP carry\nManagement has pointed to the ~$500 mn BP capex carry ending in mid-2020, with Mauritania and Senegal capex of $250 mn in 2020 once this has been exhausted, but expects additional capex to be funded through its anticipated divestiture program. The capital budget guidance for 2020 of $325 mn to $375 mn does not include the capital for Mauritania and Senegal.\n\n3. KOS provided a more positive update around its Ghana assets\nFollowing negative implications for Kosmos Energy after its JV partner, Tullow, announced a production and resource downgrade at the TEN and Jubilee assets, management has indicated that the partners have since executed a gas handling expansion project, enabling higher gas throughput and ultimately, higher production levels. Production levels have now reached around 90 kbpd, with further work to improve gas compressor reliability to enable stable flows at this rate. KOS has also pointed the addition of a rig in 1H2020, to further underpin consistent production. \n\nTrade:\n7/17 $2.50 Calls (ITM by ~$0.40) were dirt cheap today @ $0.70\n10/16 $2.50 Calls even a better deal at $0.75\n\nDisclosure: I bought 10 7/17 $2.50 and 10 10/16 $2.50 calls today.", "created_utc": 1583197227, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fcmhiq/dd_kosmos_energy_ltd_kos_buy/", "is_self": true}
