This earnings week is going to be a fun one, which are you most excited about?", "selftext": "1) Personally, I just bought a couple shares of PayPal on Thursday dip to 105$ and payed off immediately but I am very hesitant to play any options on it. \n \n2) I played Microsoft options last week, got in at an average of 1.01 for 124c (they were as cheap at .88 cents) and lowered my average but I wish I had bought more. I sold all of them because I didn\u2019t want to get greedy and took my profits. But Microsoft closed at 123.4. I wish I held my calls but what ever. I\u2019m hoping it drops Monday so I can play options again. What are you guys doing with Microsoft? \n\n3) SNAP - honestly don\u2019t want touch this stock. Idk wtf earning are going to look like. Hear lots of bulls and lots of bears. So fuck that, I think I\u2019m out. But I do wish you all the best of luck.\n\nI know there are a ton of other great companies, V, BA. etc", "created_utc": 1555856604, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bfpaxy/happy_easter_this_earnings_week_is_going_to_be_a/", "is_self": true}
