{"id": "fhg555", "title": "Your Morning Reading List and the Coming Global Debt Crisis", "selftext": "# **TOC:**\n\n1. **INTRO**\n2. **TLDR**\n3. **EXPLANATION**\n4. **MY POSITIONS**\n5. **READING LIST**\n\nHello /r/wallstreetbets and fellow autists (ever realize that autist is just one letter away from artist?). I hope you're having a good morning. I'm here to give you a big reading list.\n\n----\n\n**But first, the TLDR:**\n\n- Coof coofs from beer virus will make people stop work\n- People stop work, can't pay loans\n- People not work, their company fails, company defaults on loans\n- HIP-states begin to fail because they have falling tax revenue, failing infrastructure, and are already highly indebted (Highly Indebted Countries list)\n- Banks start to fail due to liquidity/repo issues compounding with the aforementioned issues - they either get bailed out or fail, either way they drop a lot\n- \ud83c\udf08\ud83e\uddf8 market forever\n- **BUY PUTS ON BANKS *(ESPECIALLY THOSE EXPOSED TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, HOLDING PANDEMIC BONDS, OR IN THE 3RD WORLD/DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. FOCUS ON INDIA/SE ASIA/AFRICA IF YOU CAN FIND SOMETHING TO TRADE THERE.)***\n- Or, if you're lazy, buy puts on the indices /u/Joesocktwo listed in [his post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fe5s7e/the_fed_repos_are_an_attempt_to_prop_up_the/fjmjpxv/).\n\n----\n\nI had the (dis?)pleasure of visiting the World Economic Forum in Davos this year. I was invited because a Swiss investment group provided seed funding for my company, and they had a few events there. It was a fun, strange time. I had Nouriel Roubini yell at me about crypto being a scam, mistook Robert Shiller for a waiter (he looked good in his tux), and talked with Mr. Solomon - DJ D-Sol - about his career as a DJ, without knowing who he was. See these pictures: \n\nA lot of people in Davos were scared about the Coronavirus, but they're all even more scared about debt. Bankers are terrified because a debt crisis is coming, and no one has any idea what to do about it. All the tools in the toolbox are broken, and all the nuts that can be tightened are nearly stripped. There is no plan.\n\nI started reading more about the repo market, the debt crisis we're in, and how this beer virus is compounding this. We're pretty fucked - so we may as well get some tendies out of the whole mess. I can't explain the gravity of the situation to you with you reading the reading list below. Skim through the articles and see what interests you, and then read the ones that sound scariest to you. I also highly recommend the one from the \"World Socialist Website\" - **[Growing fears of global debt crisis](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2020/01/22/debt-j22.html)** - probably written by some Trans-Geographical Ethnic Economies Studies B.A. holder, but it's well put together. Also note the **[Corporate Debt Article](https://www.financialsense.com/blog/18927/size-corporate-debt-one-rung-above-junk-has-never-been-greater-warns-louis-gave)** (with this attached diagram https://imgur.com/a/4KhGW2m).\n\n----\n\nCheck out the awesome DD on repo markets by /u/Joesocktwo from a few days ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fe5s7e/the_fed_repos_are_an_attempt_to_prop_up_the/, and [my comments on ABSA Bank.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fe5s7e/the_fed_repos_are_an_attempt_to_prop_up_the/fjt9yot/?context=3)\n\nAlso pinging /u/a0wner1, /u/otto_zxon, /u/riodeshake, /u/shaw2885, /u/hoxbat, and /u/Odd-Sense who all expressed interest in a post like this.\n\nAlso /u/Virtue_Voidwalker claims to have [researched all this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fe5s7e/the_fed_repos_are_an_attempt_to_prop_up_the/fjmnf18) and found that [banks are not the play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fe5s7e/the_fed_repos_are_an_attempt_to_prop_up_the/fjpitax). Please, Mr/s Voidwalker, let me know if I'm wrong, and tell us where we should be YOLOing our money instead!\n\n### ***!!!!!DO NOT TAKE MY INVESTMENT ADVICE! I AM NOT AN INVESTMENT ADVISOR! I AM AN AUTISTIC IDIOT ON THE INTERNET!!!!!***\n\nOn that note, the following are my positions and strategy for today's big day. I'm not taking this so seriously regarding making money (and I have a tiny portfolio) but I want % gainz to stroke my ego. If you have any plays you think I should make with a remaining few hundred to play around with, tell me what they are. Thanks. \n\n*Note that all unless otherwise marked as such, I just have one of each listed option.*\n\n----\n\n## **SELL:**\n\n| TICKER | STRIKE | DATE     | P/C  | GAIN/LOSS ($) |\n| ------ | ------ | -------- | ---- | ------------- |\n| EWI    | $16    | 04/17/20 | P    | +13           |\n| SPY    | $105   | 04/17/20 | P    | +8            |\n| EWJ    | $30    | 06/19/20 | P    | +1            |\n| TOTAL  | N/A    | N/A      | N/A  | $22           |\n\n----\n\n## **HOLD:**\n\n| TICKER | STRIKE | DATE     | P/C  | GAIN/LOSS ($) |\n| ------ | ------ | -------- | ---- | ------------- |\n| EWG    | $20    | 07/17/20 | P    | -0.65         |\n| EWG    | $19    | 04/17/20 | P    | +38           |\n| EWI    | $20    | 04/17/20 | P    | +63           |\n| INDA   | $28    | 04/17/20 | P    | +10           |\n| INDA   | $25    | 06/19/20 | P    | +1.85         |\n| IBN    | $11    | 09/18/20 | P    | +6.85         |\n| SPY    | $200   | 04/17/20 | P    | +149          |\n| SPY    | $180   | 04/17/20 | P    | +41.35        |\n| SPY    | $175   | 04/17/20 | P    | +13.85        |\n| SPY    | $157   | 04/17/20 | P    | +42           |\n| SPY    | $145   | 06/19/20 | P    | +50           |\n| DIA    | $151   | 04/17/20 | P    | +78           |\n| DIA    | $149   | 04/17/20 | P    | +141          |\n| DIA    | $149   | 04/17/20 | P    | +30.35        |\n| BAC    | $22    | 05/15/20 | P    | +26.35        |\n| BCS    | $5     | 01/15/21 | P    | +0            |\n| TOTAL  | N/A    | N/A      | N/A  | $690.95       |\n\n----\n\n## **BUY:**\n\n| TICKER | STRIKE | DATE     | P/C  |\n| ------ | ------ | -------- | ---- |\n| BAC    | $19    | 08/21/20 | P    |\n| BCS    | $4     | 01/15/20 | P    |\n| DB     | $5     | 10/16/20 | P    |\n| ICICI  | $12    | 09/18/20 | P    |\n| EWG    | $22    | 07/17/20 | P    |\n| INDA   | $26    | 09/18/20 | P    |\n\n----\n\n# **PRE-2019**\n\n#### **[The Repo Market and the Start of the Financial Crisis](https://www.nber.org/digest/dec09/w15223.html)**\n\n*The loss of liquidity at the firms that were the biggest players in the securitized banking system ...led to the financial crisis.*\n\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research | 2010\n\n\n\n----\n\n#### **[What types of assets are used as collateral in the repo market?](https://www.icmagroup.org/Regulatory-Policy-and-Market-Practice/repo-and-collateral-markets/icma-ercc-publications/frequently-asked-questions-on-repo/6-what-types-of-asset-are-used-as-collateral-in-the-repo-market/)**\n\n*Repo using collateral other than high-quality government bonds is often called credit repo.
