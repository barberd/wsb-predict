{"id": "gfbl8t", "title": "$WYNN DD - I'm done.", "selftext": "Everything I knew about conducting good DD tossed out the window in one earnings report. Im done for now until the market becomes rational again. Trying to justify these price movements is giving me daily migraines, I need a break from this.\n\nIf anyone still wants to play this stock here's everything that was just COMPLETELY IGNORED in its earnings report yesterday.\n\n* 43% Decline in revenue\n* Net loss of over 400 million Q1, -3.54 eps which was -237% below estimated -1.05 eps\n* Suspended their 5% dividend\n* Issued $600 million in new 2025 bonds at an 8% yield towards the end of Q1\n* Still have 2.9 b in cash, equivalents, and restricted cash (bullish, if they are able to reduce cash burn)\n* Will continue paying their U.S employees salary + benefits through May 15th (I really respect this, but it will result in higher cash burn through Q2)\n* Q2 Estimate is -1.14 eps, 1.1 B in Revenue. Yeah you heard that right. They will miraculously increase rev and EPS during a historically bad quarter. I mean they've missed earnings 4 times in a row, for sure they won't miss again. /s\n\nSome other financials to consider\n\n* Debt to equity ratio of 6\n* During 2019 traded at an average PE of 70 - for comparison, LVS trades at PE of 11, MGM is at 3\n* Paying 130 mill per quarter in interest on debt, this will increase slightly with newly issued notes\n* Assets are depreciating at an average rate of 140 mill per quarter\n\nWhere the fuck are S&P and Moodys? It's unclear when WYNN will turn a profit again, are leverage by a multiple of 6, and are issuing 5y bonds at an 8% yield. Credit agencies -  DO YOUR FUCKING JOB. Last rating was in Sep from Moodys, where they state\n\n>The positive rating outlook reflects Moody's expectation that Boston Encore Harbor, which officially opened June 23, 2019 will ramp successfully during the next 6-12 month period. The positive rating outlook also considers Moody's favorable positive long-term revenue and earnings prospects for the company's Macau, China and Las Vegas Strip, Nevada casino resort assets.\n\nGuess what. None of these locations make money anymore. They probably won't turn a profit for the rest of the year. Why are agencies holding back on downgrading this piece of shit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis stock is up 45% in April. They released most of the info in this post yesterday AH. Stock is up 1% as Im typing this. My puts are toast, probably holding until exp in Sep in case the market decides to suddenly wake the fuck up.", "created_utc": 1588874261.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfbl8t/wynn_dd_im_done/", "is_self": true}
