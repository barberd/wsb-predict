I'm trying to figure our how badly companies tank when lockups expire for additional BYND put play. Trying to figure out why CMG tanked in 12/2007...\n\nLooks like Privateer Holding controlled \\~77% of TLRY share before lockup expired. Privateer released shares SLOWLY overtime to get to our current IPO price point of TLRY. It looks like there was maybe a 25% drop in the stock price after lockup expiry, but this took approximately 3 months.\n\nI am using GPRO as an example of an overvalued company... similar to BYND IMHO. People say BYND is a disruptor like TSLA, but I think that is completely BS. I think when companies like Tyson start getting serious, the BYND market will be cornered to those who hate big corporations and want 100% plant based burger (companies like Tyson are using eggs as one of thier ingrediants so this will scare away the vegans).  Furtheremore, large companies will have the infrastucture to make product a lot cheaper. Unlike the TSLA consumer base, my guess is that the number of BYND consumer base (corporate haters and vegans) are far less.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like I am trying to reason myself to buying more long puts, which probably means I shouldn't....... \n\nSomeone please argue against me!
