Soon enough people will realize that they need to make money and they need to do it FAST. Many of them will look on the internet and find stuff about stocks and, you guessed it, OPTIONS. They will come here and see all of the gains porn from /u/WSBGod and think they will be able to do the same because it's all just buying low and selling high, right? This means that more people coming in will mean more demand for both calls and puts because nobody knows if the market will go upwards/downwards/or in circles right?
