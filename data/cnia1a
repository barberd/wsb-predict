{"id": "cnia1a", "title": "The Inaugural Annual Mini-YOLO for Martin Shkreli", "selftext": "As you all know, our boy Martin Shkreli is still being held in FCI Allenwood Low until 09/14/2023.\n\nI want to do something nice for him. I was thinking about contracting a mailing service to send him 10,000 automated fan letters or perhaps maxing out his commissary account (87850053SHKRELI) so he could get a new tin of Spartin' Waves Pomade.  I think it has been a while since we've shown him some love. \n\nTo that end and because this year has been a year of monsoon profits I am earmarking $75k to Mini-YOLO for Martin.\n\n**What does this mean?** \n\nThis means I will invest $75k into the top 3 voted moves in this thread and use 100% of the profits (less 34% taxes) from that YOLO to send some kind of care package to Martin.\n\n**Rules:**\n\n1) Post what you believe are legitimate moves that you'd like me to make this coming Monday (Aug 12).  Then vote on two others. They can be equity or option plays.  They can be short or long positions or even complex weird options strategies.  But intentionally dumb upvoted positions will be ignored.\n\n2) The three posts with the most votes by close of trading this Friday (4pm Eastern) will be the moves I make on Monday August 12th.\n\n3) I will automatically dump any position that loses 35%.  I will use my own discretion on when to sell for max profit to show Martin max love.\n\n4) I will post proof of the positions taken on Monday and proof of the profit or loss when the positions are closed.  All positions will be closed by Friday Aug 16th at latest. \n\n5) If we come out profitable, we will have a second round of voting on what we should do with the money.  Options include:\n\n* Mass mailing him\n* Loading up his commissary account\n* Paying to have different escorts visit him weekly\n* Paying advertisement trucks with a customized banner to park outside or repeatedly drive past the prison during his outside time. \n\n6) I will provide proof the love sent to Martin was indeed delivered.  100% of the profit will go to this activity. We will then feel a few drops of dopamine, warmness in our hearts, and then move on to the next evolution.\n\nIn summary, No, this is not bullshit.  I am serious here.  This is pure unadulterated autistic profit crowdsourcing to shine some love on god emperor Shkreli.  I will check this thread this coming Friday night and then post the three positions I plan to take next Monday.  If this goes well, I'd like to make it an annual event. While the DSM-5 calls ASD an affliction ....I affectionately refer to it as a cash printing machine. Let's see how much we can make it rain next week.\n\nI know if we all put our hearts and our minds together, the WSB Autist Quant Force will be unstoppable.  WSBAQF Unite.\n\nSincerely,\n\nFrank\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**If you'd like to write him below is how you can:**\n\n*MARTIN SHKRELI  87850-053*\n\n*FCI Allenwood Low*\n\n*FEDERAL CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION*\n\n*P.O.
