No more overnight YOLO plays - no more diamond hands, no more credit spreads, and no more betting on the next big thing. \n\nI have converted my TDA account to a cash account - allowing for unlimited day trades up to the amount of cash I have in the account on a daily basis. This means that every day I can spend up to whatever my starting cash balance is for the day on trades, and as long as I sell them the same day, the cash will have settled and be available for me to use again the next day. I will be taking my cues based on earnings reports and option flows - and making momentum and MACD based plays. \n\nI am moving my final gambling $2000 into my cash account - of which $1000 has arrived - the other $1000 is going to take some time as I move money around. In the meantime, I will start with this $1000.\n\nAs we execute this plan - there will be three times that we take profit. \n\n1. Account Balance of $4000.00 - take out $2000.00 for our initial investment\n2. Account Balance of $14328.00 - take out $12328 to cover my lost cash\n3. Account Balance of $6057.37 - take out $4057.37 to take out my equity losses\n\nEach day I will post an update of my account, and my positions taken. \n\nDay 1: 5/11 +5% - $1000.89 - $1046.34\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|DDOG 5/15 55c|\\+54|1|$380|$434|\n|CSCO 5/15 44.5c|\\-16|2|$214|$198|\n|CHWY 5/15 39.5c|\\+12|1|$134|$146|", "created_utc": 1589304802.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gifwy1/day_1_from_down_to_up_the_road_to_1838537_5/", "is_self": true}
