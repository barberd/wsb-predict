{"id": "go26av", "title": "Bank loss provision vs. Actual losses", "selftext": "I've been having the suspicion that banks in the US are in more trouble than people think. I'm going to make some quick calculations in order to prove my point. Please feel free to shit in my arguments as I may be (and probably am) missing something as this is, of course, absolutely not priced in.  \n\n\nFirst, US big banks have a joint loan loss provision of 25 billion dollars. For those who know shit about accounting, that's something you use in your balance sheet to go against losses from irrecoverable debts. It drags down your earnings at the end of the cycle. Anywho, according to CNBC, [Americans are in a total of 930 billions in credit card debt](https://www.cnbc.com/select/us-credit-card-debt-hits-all-time-high/). And according to this article from our friends at the WSJ [credit cards are being unpaid at a rate of 3%](https://www.wsj.com/articles/millions-of-americans-skip-credit-card-and-car-payments-11589985381?tesla=y&mod=article_inline)\n\n3% of 1 trillion is 30 billions. We've eaten through the provision and we've **only** talked about the credit card debt. THere's loans to the energy sector that will go unpaid (wels fargo has the highest exposure to these). There's mortages, personal loans. Etc. Total consumer loans in the US are sitting at an all time high of 14.3 trillion. \n\nI belive banks are due for a heavy correction in the near future. I'm probably forgetting some loans are insured or some other financial apparatus that I'm not aware of. Please feel free to shit all over this with FACTS AND LOGIC.", "created_utc": 1590085340.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/go26av/bank_loss_provision_vs_actual_losses/", "is_self": true}
