I want something more challenging. If that means investing more, then ok. I don't have any kids, I don't have any debts, let's get the ball rolling. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI work really close to the UBS on 6th avenue here in New York and Im thinking about making an appointment with them tomorrow. My financial goal is simple. I'm looking to learn and I'm looking to grow. \n\nI like volatile markets but I also like diversification, above all I like to learn. \n\nI have a few ETFs in my Ameritrade as well as 6 stocks. Not much, I understand. TD Ameritrade will be having a workshop soon which I plan to attend, but what Im more interested in is mingling with the larger investment banks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlus, Ill be going to Switzerland in two months and so I want to understand a little more about the banking culture there.", "created_utc": 1562711170, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cb7wtp/opening_an_account_with_ubs/", "is_self": true}
