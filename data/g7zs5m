With a quote \u201cyou have no idea about growth investing those stocks look like a bad heartbeat\u201d\n\nWouldn\u2019t usually post something like this in r/wsb but. Am I being a hypocrite here suggesting the miners to them, or are they just a bigger group of autists than us?", "created_utc": 1587843268.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7zs5m/am_i_the_retard/", "is_self": true}
