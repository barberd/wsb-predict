All 101% of you tart heads had bought MSFT calls.\n\nOh hoho... \n\nBUT WHATDAYA KNOW. SOAB DIDNT MOVE A FAT PINKY AFTER EARNINGS. NOT EVEN 1/100*100 \n\nI was promised that inversing WSB was foolproof. \n\nBut this morning I finally realized. \n\nY'all been lying.\n\nCant inverse something you've become part of. \n\nIt's the WSB curse.", "created_utc": 1571920716, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dmft00/yall_been_lying/", "is_self": true}
