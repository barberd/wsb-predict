A beneficiary of this? RV firms. For example, Airstream is one of the most popular brands among the retirees and the millennials for its iconic look and quality. Thor industries owns many brands and are poised to dominate this space going forward. \n\nAs CNBC notes, this may be the summer for National Parks to dominate.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/23/national-parks-could-be-summers-go-to-vacation-spots.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/23/national-parks-could-be-summers-go-to-vacation-spots.html)\n\nAs the RV Industry Association (RVIA) notes, \u201csales of RVs have increased 170 percent since this time last year.\u201d In addition to this, THOR has had a remarkable year, which you can see from their last earnings call.\n\n[https://www.rvtravel.com/sales950b/](https://www.rvtravel.com/sales950b/)\n\n**As an entity, Thor did a great job last Q. Highlights are:** \n\n\"With record second-quarter revenues, improved quarterly gross profit margin year-over-year, a growing order backlog and successful new product introductions in the Class B space, all key indicators for Thor Industries were strong in the second quarter. I am especially pleased to note that consolidated revenues were a new second-quarter record for Thor. EHG also reported strong revenues and, as anticipated, returned to quarterly profitability in line with historical trends. It has been a strong start to the year, and we believe we are very well positioned for growth in North America and Europe as we enter our peak selling and cash flow season,\" said Bob Martin, President and CEO of Thor Industries.\n\n[https://ir.thorindustries.com/investor-resources/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Thor-Announces-Net-Sales-of-2-Billion-Improved-Gross-Profit-Margin-and-Higher-Backlog-for-the-Second-Quarter-of-Fiscal-2020/default.aspx](https://ir.thorindustries.com/investor-resources/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Thor-Announces-Net-Sales-of-2-Billion-Improved-Gross-Profit-Margin-and-Higher-Backlog-for-the-Second-Quarter-of-Fiscal-2020/default.aspx)\n\nI am a fan of using google trends to determine how much traffic is going to a site. As you can see here, there has been a big swing in interest, and where there is smoke there is fire. More importantly, this is going to be a big boom in this shortly, especially when the second wave hits. \n\n[https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%203-m&geo=US&q=Airstream](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%203-m&geo=US&q=Airstream)\n\n[https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%203-m&geo=US&q=RVs](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%203-m&geo=US&q=RVs)\n\n[https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%203-m&geo=US&q=%2Fm%2F0c\\_61d](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%203-m&geo=US&q=%2Fm%2F0c_61d)\n\nSee you in the green.
