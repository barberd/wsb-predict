{"id": "f39bcy", "title": "Futures YOLO potential", "selftext": "Amp Futures: the unknown gem (broker) that maxes out futures leverage 10x as much as your shitty TD Ameritrade account offers. Im here for the autists that want a vacation from options but still want to show off their giant fuck sacks with massive tendies gains. Still not convinced retard? Ill break it down further.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTD Ameritrade charges your ass $6600 for ONE SINGLE $NQ\\_F contract. Amp Futures Charges your ass $500 for ONE SINGLE $NQ\\_F contract. So you want to put a 10lot on but don't have $66,000 to do it TD?? NOT A PROBELM. Amp allows it for $500. So please, go blow up with Amp. \n\nPerspective: $NQ\\_F is down 100 handles since the 6pm open. Do the math fuck tards. A 10 lot=$200 made or lost for each handle that thing drops. Just here to spread some wise love. \n\nAND REMEMBER YOUR 5K ACCOUNT IS FUCKED ON A 10 LOT IF THAT DAMN THING EVEN GOES 20 HANDLES AGAINST YOU", "created_utc": 1581597244, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f39bcy/futures_yolo_potential/", "is_self": true}
