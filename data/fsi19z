Let\u2019s say 30 million are unemployed even if 1:10 don\u2019t get there job back that\u2019s still 3 million unemployed which beats 2008 unemployment by 400 thousand. \nSource: https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/09/business/worldbusiness/09iht-jobs.4.19232394.html\n\nAssets: Even when quarantine is over people aren\u2019t going to be running out to buy as many things as they were before. People will be more cautious still not eating out from fears of still getting the disease or fear of loosing job again. This will take a couple of years for people to get back to their old spending levels and forget about saving money.  Like bill gates said \"It's very tough to say to people, 'Hey keep going to restaurants, go buy new houses, ignore that pile of bodies over in the corner, we want you to keep spending because there's some politician that thinks GDP growth is what counts,'\"\n\nThe Fed: Obviously they are gonna try and keep the market up I can\u2019t hate them for that. If they don\u2019t do anything the people will hate them for not doing anything. (The bad part is that the stocks will hit harder when the virus is at its worse.)\n\nCOVID: No matter how dangerous the disease is now doesn\u2019t really matter the fear is already stuck in everyone\u2019s mind. This fear will translate economically as stated in the assets section above\n\nMedia: There\u2019s always going to be fear mongering articles but not sure how much you can call an article fear mongering when it says there aren\u2019t enough ventilators for people in Italy. \nSource:https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.independent.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-italy-hospitals-doctor-lockdown-quarantine-intensive-care-a9401186.html%3famp\n\nJust a gay bears view. \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b\nMaybe I\u2019m wrong idk. \n\nTLDR: Basically arguments against autist that said everything\u2019s fine.", "created_utc": 1585678483.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fsi19z/response_to_deleted_postyoure_not_in_the_big_short/", "is_self": true}
