{"id": "g24tl6", "title": "*Someone* sold emails collected from the old Discord server to spammers", "selftext": "So I had several accounts in Jtek's WSB discord server, which I signed up with throwaway emails unique in my domain. Guess what. They all just got spammed with [this](https://i.imgur.com/tl1dcWI.png). Note: that email was only used for a discord account that only joined the old server and did nothing else.\n\nHow did they collect these emails? The discord invite link that used to be on the sidebar asked permission to authorize a discord app to have access to your discord email, before redirecting you to the actual invite link. That way he harvest all of your emails. Check your \"Authorized apps\" in your discord account. [This is what you should see if you joined the server after the sidebar link was changed](https://i.imgur.com/4xNcJz5.png). It's likely if that's the case, you also got the spam email.\n\nI've been asked by mods to not point any fingers, but let's just say it was very likely a former mod.\n\nThe fucker completely sold us out, and is milking it as hard as he can.\n\n**Edit 1:** If you live in California, [CCPA](https://www.smartrmail.com/blog/ccpa-email-marketing/) might apply to you. In Europe, GDPR might too. He also violated Discord's [terms of service](https://discordapp.com/terms) since it prohibits \"attempt to obtain passwords or other private information from other members;\" by harvesting emails and IPs.\n\n**Edit 2:** According to Cam, he had no idea that the email list was obtained illegitimately, please do not direct any hate towards him. While he did make the mistake of accepting a random email list without making sure the emails listed were interested, the person who sold him the email list is who we should care the most about. He said a discord account (now deleted) approached him about this. [Here is what he told me](https://i.imgur.com/qSiQ6jI.png). And [here](https://i.imgur.com/QOC7IZ4.png) is his statement in his Discord.\n\n**Edit 3:** This thread is getting so popular I should write a book about it to make money off of autists :\\^)\n\n**Edit 4:** Cam also said he got the email list \"a couple of weeks ago or like two weeks ago, hard to remember, I get 100s of messages a day\". ~~So it's likely the former mod started selling us out before he got banned.~~ Nope, check edit 7 later on.\n\n**Edit 5:** Holy shit. [Check this out](https://imgur.com/a/owgqjvB), a conversation between 2 mods from Jtek's server, one of them sent me that.\n\nThe mod who sent me that screenshot said then:\n\n> Now the guy who does tech support for the discord is claiming the VM that the bot that collected our info on was hacked.\n>\n>But still, they harvested our info through shady means.\n\nBut was it really hacked, or is that the excuse they're coming up with?\n\n**CHANGE YOUR DISCORD PASSWORD. AND IF YOU USED THAT PASSWORD FOR YOUR BROKERAGE ACCOUNT, YOU'RE A DUMBASS, AND CHANGE THAT TOO.** Who knows what they're up to.\n\nWhat seems to be implied is that\n\n1. Initially they collected usernames and passwords\n2. Eventually they just linked their app to your discord account and collected your email and IP\n\n**Edit 6:** Thank you all for the support guys. I'm now announcing my very own [WSB championship](https://wsb.gg/championship). Please sign up now as spots are limited. More details to be announced soon.\n\n**Edit 7:** I found a guy who was creating daily accounts and joining that Discord server because he kept getting banned daily, so we discovered the email list includes all emails up until April 8th (maybe 9th). **Which means he started selling these emails immediately after he got banned.** Not before.", "created_utc": 1586998343.0, "permalink": "/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g24tl6/someone_sold_emails_collected_from_the_old/", "is_self": true}
